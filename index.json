      "content": "Domains Protocols Numbers About Example Domains As described in RFC 2606 and RFC 6761, a number of domains such as example.com and example.org are maintained for documentation purposes. These domains may be used as illustrative examples in documents without prior coordination with us. They are not available for registration or transfer. We provide a web service on the example domain hosts to provide basic information on the purpose of the domain. These web services are provided as best effort, but are not designed to support production applications. While incidental traffic for incorrectly configured applications is expected, please do not design applications that require the example domains to have operating HTTP service.

      "content": "Domains Protocols Numbers About Domain Name Services We operate and maintain a number of key aspects of the DNS, including the root zone, and the .int and .arpa domains. The DNS Root Zone The root is the upper-most part of the DNS hierarchy, and involves delegating administrative responsibility of “top-level domains”, which are the last segment of a domain name, such as .com, .uk and .nz. Part of our tasks includes evaluating requests to change the operators of country code domains, as well as day-to-day maintenance of the details of the existing operators. .INT The .int top-level domain, designed for the sole use of cross-national organisations, such as treaty organisations, that do not naturally fit into a specific country’s top-level domain. For example, who.int for the World Health Organisation. .ARPA The .arpa domain is used internally by Internet protocols, such as for reverse mapping of IP addresses, and delivery of ENUM phone number mapping.

      "content": "Domains Protocols Numbers About Protocol Registries Protocol parameter registries represent the authoritative record of many of the codes and numbers contained in a variety of Internet protocols. We maintain these records in compliance with the associated technical standards and allocation policies, and we provide this service in coordination with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). To view or download individual protocol registries, navigate to the individual registries through the index below. Registry data is available for bulk retrieval via Rsync (recommended) or FTP. To obtain a registration in an existing registry, or to modify existing registrations, consult the relevant application form.

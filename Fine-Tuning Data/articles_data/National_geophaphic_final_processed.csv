0,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/andean-bear-mating-sounds-study,"Researchers have captured footage of these bears making a wide range of vocalizations during their most intimate moments—the first time sounds of this kind have been documented in any bear species.

Until recently, theAndean bear—the only species of bear in South America, easily recognized by the light-colored markings that frame its face like glasses—was thought to be almost mute; there were only a few documented cases of vocal exchanges between mothers and cubs in captivity. But recently, deep in the Andes, camera traps captured something unexpected: During mating, this elusive creature becomes surprisingly expressive. It moans, growls, and purrs.

With this new information, scientists are finally starting to decipher its language.

(This biologist and her rescue dog help protect bears in the Andes.)

This discovery was part of a study published in theMexican Journal of Biodiversityin January. Between 2020 and 2021, a team of researchers hid camera traps in the forests of the Colombian and Bolivian Andes in hopes of spotting the mysterious Andean bear.

The resulting recordings captured an array of sounds from the bears—grunts, gasps, and rhythmic hums—that contradicted everything previously known about this species. Far from silent, the bears were actually vocalizing with a rich and varied repertoire—and not just occasionally, but during one of their most private moments.

“The literature said these animals were silent,” saysÁngela Mendoza-Henao, a research associate at the Sound Collection of the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Biological Resources Research and one of the authors of the study. “But we could see they were constantly making many sounds…for hours.”

The study reveals the bear’s unique vocal repertoire, composed of five distinct sounds, each with a clear purpose. Thebite—a sharp, brief squeal reminiscent of the creak of a rusty hinge—is exclusive to females during contact with the male. “It’s the aural response to the male’s bite on the neck during mating,” explainsNicolás Reyes-Amaya, curator of the Humboldt Institute’s Mammal Collection and another author of the study. “The male becomes a little more excited, and the two enter a more intense phase.”

This is the first time that sounds of this kind have been documented in any bear species. In the case of the Andean bear, traditionally considered extremely silent, the discovery is even more revealing. What we are hearing is, at the very least, the beginning of a bear’s climax.

Thebitesound was identified thanks to the acute hearing of Adriana Reyes, one of the lead authors of the study, who recently passed away. She processed countless hours of recordings captured by the cameras into spectrograms. The paper describes thebiteas a variant of thehumm, the most common sound between males and females that resembles a feline-like purr.

In front of the camera traps, each copulation lasts at least an hour. “They are making sounds all the time,” Mendoza-Henao points out. “They are not spontaneous vocalizations.”

Yet none of these vocalizations have ever been observed in the presence of humans. While this particular study did not assess how the bears behave around people, Reyes-Amaya notes that many mammals reduce their vocal activity when humans are nearby, likely to avoid detection. “It wouldn’t be unusual for this to be the case with the bear,” he says, “but we would need to test it.”

(Poaching threatens South America's only bear species.)

Until now, most acoustic recordings of bears were vague descriptions, based on onomatopoeia or the intuition of the human ear, so they remained anecdotal. This study, on the other hand, analyzes the Andean bear's sexual repertoire for the first time using field-measured data, clearing away the onomatopoeia and giving a scientific voice to the pants, grunts, and snorts.

Sexual activity between the bears was recorded in all three locations over three months. Not only was this the first time the Andean bear's romantic and sexual voice was heard, but it was also the first time it was seen mating in the wild. ""It was a matter of luck,"" says Reyes-Amaya.

Although the Andean bear can measure up to 6.56 feet in length, ""they can be very cryptic when they want to be,"" Reyes-Amaya notes. The bear knows how to hide very well in the treetops, for reasons scientists still don’t understand, so it’s rare for humans to spot their imposing silhouette—one of the largest among tropical forest mammals. What is more common is to stumble upon the markings they leave on the bark of trees or the vegetation they tread.

(Bears seen mating in trees—a scientific first.)

Even so, the Andean bear travels several miles per day. That’s why Mendoza-Henao believes it’s key to have sound recordings from different regions to study the possible existence of dialects between distant populations. Andean bears live along the spine of South America, from Venezuela to Bolivia, and have adapted to cold environments such as high Andean forests and high-altitude tropical grasslands found above treelines.

""Do bears in Ecuador speak differently from those in Colombia? Do they have a different accent from bears in Bolivia? We don’t know yet,"" says Reyes-Amaya.

This discovery also opens the door to analyzing how other bear species communicate. Not all bears vocalize the same way; polar bears, for example,make almost no sounds, except for some snorts during confrontations between males or exchanges between mothers and cubs. On the other hand, black bears are typically louder than brown bears, perhaps because they live in dense forests where it’s difficult to see, so their voices become a key tool to communicate with each other. Even pandas,which emit at least 11 distinct sounds in the wild, become especially noisy when they are in heat in captivity.

For Reyes-Amaya, these kinds of findings transcend the anecdotal. ""This study is wonderful in itself, because it helps us understand and learn a little more about a majestic being,” he says.

The Andean bear's vocal repertoire not only expands what we know about its species, but also reveals how, in their world, they make themselves heard when no one is looking.

1,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/penguins-argentina-trash-evolution,"For more than 60 million years, penguins of all kinds—including the opportunistic Magellanic penguin—have been driven by an evolutionary urge to reach beyond their boundaries. Today, many are surfacing in the most unlikely places.

When Pablo “Popi”Borboroglu first visited a remote stretch of shoreline along the eastern coast of Patagonia, in 2008, theNational Geographic Explorerwas surprised to find penguins making a home there. The Argentine biologist was responding to a call from a nearby rancher who had seen several of the flightless birds on his property. When he arrived, Borboroglu found trash, broken glass, abandoned cars, and burned-out campfires on the ground. “The place was a disaster,” he recalls. “It was full of garbage.”

Amid the squalor, however, under bushes and in small, cavelike burrows, he discovered something astonishing: 12Magellanic penguinsliving among the debris. Each seabird was about one and a half feet tall, with a distinctive white band encircling its eyes and neck. While Magellanic penguins are known to breed in and around South America on rocky, sandy beaches before migrating each winter to the open ocean as far north as Brazil and Peru, the nearest established colony was located more than 80 miles south. Yet these intrepid travelers had arrived and coupled up, a sign that they were breeding on a beach teeming with hazards.

Borborogluworked quickly, assessing the condition of the colony and freeing one bird that was entangled in plastic, and began the longer process of painstakingly cleaning and securing the area. The emerging colony not only survived but raised chicks, returning the next spring. Scientists have various theories as to why a so-called founder group like this ventures beyond familiar nesting grounds. But for Borboroglu, who went on to create the Global Penguin Society, an international conservation group, the new colony exemplifies the adaptability and resilience of all 18 penguin species, which inhabit some of nature’s harshest environments, even as they continue to face new challenges in our changing world. “They are so brave and determined,” he says of penguins as a whole. “They’re amazing.”

Penguins are indeed amazing creatures. Their comical waddle, tuxedo-like appearance, and endearing parental instincts make them quintessential conservation icons. But these same characteristics also point to some of the ways they’ve evolved to confront extreme conditions with remarkable adaptability and grit. The first penguins appeared roughly 60 million years ago on what is now New Zealand. Some scientists believe the absence of natural predators allowed the birds to evolve away from flight and toward more agility in the ocean. Over time, they developed ample stores of fat and a dense, impermeable layer of feathers to withstand the cold; stunted wings serving as flippers to propel them underwater with stunning speed and efficiency; and distinctive black-and-white feather patterns to confuse predators.

Early penguins rode the currents across oceans, adapting to the new places where they landed. Emperor and Adélie penguins, for instance, settled in the unforgiving climate of Antarctica, and they have a thicker layer of body fat, scalelike feathers, and clawlike feet especially suited to gain traction on the ice. Galápagos penguins ended up on a chain of islands off the coast of Ecuador, becoming the only species found at the Equator. They now have smaller frames and thinner layers of plumage, which serve them well in the warmer climate. Historically, Magellanic penguins lived on islands off the coast of South America, but after sheep ranchers eradicated mainland predators such as pumas and foxes, the birds established colonies there too. “Penguins vote with their feet,” says National Geographic Explorer Dee Boersma, a renowned penguin expert at the University of Washington. “They go where the food is.”

But no matter how far they roam, many of the animals now face the same issues. About half the world’s penguins are threatened with extinction, and last year the African penguin became the first to be classified as critically endangered. Today the threats come from sea and land alike. In the ocean, penguins must run a gauntlet of oil spills, algal blooms, fishing nets, and plastic pollution while warming waters and overfishing deplete their prey. On shore, where penguins mate and raise their chicks, they encounter hazards ranging from declining Antarctic sea ice to coastal development and introduced or resurgent predators. Over the past century, as penguin numbers faltered, the global conservation community and individual nations moved to safeguard the birds, banning egg harvesting and creating protected areas, allowing embattled populations a chance at continued survival. In the years since, conservationists like Borboroglu and Boersma have lobbied to create more protected areas for nesting and regulate shipping routes to reduce penguins’ potential exposure to oil spills.

(How a penguin ""massacre"" led to historic new protections in Argentina.)

One startling finding among scientists is that penguins are no longer evolving as fast, limiting their ability to keep pace with the world around them. A recent study showed that penguins now have the slowest evolutionary rates of all birds. Still, some appear adept at leveraging their best traits and behaviors to continue pressing into new territory. Researchers have discovered that emperor penguin colonies relocate when sea ice in one area is no longer reliable, and satellite imagery recently revealed previously unknown colonies in Antarctica. Meanwhile, king penguins, smaller cousins to the emperors, are in decline in some of their habitat but rebounding in other places, after decades of being harvested for oil. And gentoos, closely related to Adélies, are following available food as the Southern Ocean warms and sea ice clears, allowing them to more easily hunt and nest in new areas of the Antarctic Peninsula. “We’re seeing new colonies established further and further south,” says Gemma Clucas, a researcher with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

The handful of Magellanic penguins that once popped up on the trash-strewn beach in Patagonia appear to have inspired others to settle in the colony. As Borboroglu worked with landowners and the local government to create a 35,000-acre wildlife refuge, more and more penguins arrived each year. Over 8,000 penguins now nest here. “Its growth has been remarkable,” he says. “It shows that nature can thrive if given a chance.”

2,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/caterpillar-bone-collector-moth-spider-camouflage,"A newly described species from Hawaiʻi hides itself with carcasses to avoid getting eaten by spiders.

It’s Halloween every day for the bone collector caterpillar. The moth larva decorates its drag-along dwelling with scavenged body parts from dead insects. This ghastly getup mayallow the creatures to live alongside spiderswithout being detected.

These pill-sized caterpillars look like piles of parts—an ant head here, fly legs and wings there, a stuck-on weevil head, and jettisoned spider legs jutting out all over. Beneath this constructed case is a “generic white gushy body,” saysDaniel Rubinoff, an entomologist at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. “It’s gross at one level, but it’s also kind of adorable. They’re cruising around like, ‘Oh, this looks delicious. I’ll eat some of this and then put the rest on my back.’”

Rubinoff and his colleagues described the new carnivorous caterpillar and its curious behavior April 24 inScience. They’ve yet to give the species a scientific name. These moths belong to a genus calledHyposmocomafound in Hawai’i known for spinning portable silk cases in which they hide. Some decorate their cases with pebbles,diatoms, or lichen. But no other knownHyposmocomauses insect remains.

(These caterpillars take looking like poop to a new level.)

Carnivory itself is unusual for caterpillars. Among butterflies and moths, 99.9 percent eat plants or fungi, Rubinoff says. But bone collector caterpillars slink through cobwebs in rotted logs, tree hollows, or crevices in rock and dine on newly dead or weakened insects they find, even gnawing through silk for a meal. After chowing down, the bone collectors check out what’s left and attach pieces to their cases using silk that they produce.

Rubinoff first spied the bone collector over two decades ago while looking for other case-wearing caterpillars that feast on rotting wood. But these creepy crawlies seem rather rare. In 22 years of scouring Hawaiian forests, his team has collected only 62 individuals.

“It’s a great piece of field work,” says evolutionary biologistDavid Lohmanat the City College of New York who was not part of the study. Small, drab, and holed up in covert cobwebs, the caterpillars would be tricky to spot, he says.

After finding the critters, Rubinoff’s team brought them back to the lab. There, they glimpsed bits of bone collector behavior. Captive caterpillars go after slow moving prey and can even become cannibalistic in shared quarters.

Bone collectors seem to methodically curate their cases. Lacking insect and arthropod parts, the caterpillars won’t tack on other types of debris. And they pay special attention to size. They probe prospective additions with their mandibles, rotate them and chew big pieces down to size. “It’s very serial killer-esque,” Rubinoff says.

The carcass castles seem crafted to hide the bone collectors’ identity. Rubinoff has noticed the larvae lurking near spiders. A bone collector can’t outrun a spider, but covered in insect slivers and shed spider skins, it may smell to the spider like a mixture of itself and past meals. The researchers suspect that camouflaging themselves as the walking dead likely helps the caterpillars avoid becoming dead meat, and that bone collectors likely evolved to live with and steal from spiders. Other parts of the world host other insects that rob spiders. But “there isn’t anything else in Hawaiʻi that does this,” Rubinoff says.

(Butterflies get all the love—but caterpillars may be even more stunning.)

Rubinoff’s team has been poking around rotting logs all over the Hawaiian Islands, and yet they’ve only found these creatures on Oʻahu in a 15-square-kilometer area of one mountain range. “You would expect this to be particularly threatened, and the fact they find it only in one tiny spot on one island is pretty sobering,” saysNaomi Pierce, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University who wasn’t part of the work.

Based on where bone collectors fit in their family tree, this species evolved over six million years ago—before their current home island formed around three million years ago. The insects had to have migrated from a different Hawaiian island that formed earlier.

Unlike otherHyposmocomamoths, the bone collector has no sister species across otherislands. That suggests that something has destroyed the bone collector’s close kin, Rubinoff says. “I am sure that prehuman contact, this lineage was widespread.”

Many native Hawaiian butterflies and moths have similarly disappeared. Nearly 40 percentwere presumed or possibly extinct, Rubinoff and his team recently estimated. These creatures face threats due to loss of habitat, climate change and predation from introduced species, such as ants, which didn’t evolve in the islands. Part of bone collectors’ resilience may stem from their ability to use invasive spiders’ webs. Still, without action, these oddities—possibly the last of their kind—may not survive. “I would imagine it’s not long for this world,” Pierce says.

Hawaiʻi, and other archipelagos, can evolve such curious species—such as those that belong toHyposmocoma—because of how isolated they are, saysAkito Kawahara, a lepidopterist at the University of Florida in Gainsville who wasn’t part of the work. Rubinoff’s team has previously foundHyposmocomacaterpillars that live underwater. Others decorate their cases with specific colors of lichen. It’s not surprising that the carnivorous, body-part collector fits with this family, he says. “It just makes you think about what’s out there that we really haven’t seen.”

“When it comes to butterflies and moths, most people think of the adult,” Kawahara says. The bone collector caterpillarmetamorphosesinto a glam-looking moth, with wings decked out in white fringe. But the critters’ macabre lifestyle reveals how fascinating an insect’s teenage phase can be. “We kind of forget about the caterpillars and what they’re doing. And it just shows you how diverse they are.”

3,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/beaver-butt-goo-vanilla-flavoring,"Castoreum, a substance from sacs near a beaver’s anus, has been used in human products for more than 2,000 years. Some wonder if it's still an ingredient on today's grocery shelves.

Are there beaver secretions in your vanilla ice cream?

News articles or food influencers on social media might have you believe thatcastoreum, a yellow, syrupy substance from the castor sacs near abeaver’s anus, is used as everyday vanilla flavoring, disguised as “natural.” According to some of these sources, beaver castor is an ingredient in everything from vanilla ice cream to strawberry-flavored oatmeal.

But experts say this couldn’t be further from the truth. While people have used castoreum for medicinal purposes and, yes, to flavor perfumes and foods since ancient times, there’s almost nothing in the grocery store today that contains castoreum.

“It turns out that the stuff is incredibly expensive, because it’s rare; there's no way it’s in your ice cream,” saysMichelle Francl, a chemist at Bryn Mawr College who studies the science of food.

According to Francl,in 2020 about 16 million pounds of vanilla extract—collected from vanilla orchids, a large group of flowering plants—was produced worldwide, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.

That said, castoreum still exists in niche products such as bäversnaps, a Swedish liquor, according to the 2022 bookBeavers: Ecology, Behaviour, Conservation, and Managementby Frank Rosell and Róisín Campbell-Palmer. In total, the U.S. consumes less than 292 pounds a year of castoreum, castoreum extract, and castoreum liquid, according to the latest edition of Fenaroli's Handbook of Flavor Ingredients.

To harvest castoreum, trappers kill beavers and remove their castor glands, which are dried and crushed. They then use alcohol to extract castoreum, similar to how vanilla is removed from the plant to make your vanilla ice cream, Francl says.

For over 2,000 years, people have turned to castoreum to cure all sorts of maladies, including fevers, stomach issues, and mental illnesses. The secretions were also used in soaps and creams, and at one point was added to cigarettes to enhance the scent. Hippocrates even wrote about castoreum’s healing properties in 500 B.C.

“By the Roman period, it was a stock part of people’s pharmacopeia,” says Francl.

Castoreum’s popularity as medicine likely has something to do with its chemical makeup. According to the 2022 book, castoreum can contain more than 75 different chemical compounds—an unusually high diversity.

The molasses-like material also contains salicylic acid, or aspirin, which can alleviate pain. Castoreum also hasfatty acidslike those in expensive skin creams. And some of its molecules are structurally similar to vanillin, the compound in vanilla orchids that’s responsible for the trademark vanilla taste.

Unfortunately, the demand for castoreum came at a cost. It was a byproduct of the centuries-long fur trade, which decimated North American and Eurasian beaver populations, nearly rendering both species extinct by the 16th century in Europe and the 19th century in North America.

Castoreum plays a vital role in beavers’ everyday lives.

To mark their territory, both beaver species deposit mud piles on the ground and excrete castoreum on top. This serves the threefold purpose of elevating the odor, adding moisture to the scent to make it more potent, and protecting the smell from rising water levels, according to Dietland Müller-Schwarze in his 2011 bookThe Beaver: Natural History of a Wetlands Engineer.

While both males and females have castor sacs, adult males in a family are most likely to leave scent markings in strategic locations—like the pathways of other beavers—to send the message that this land is taken.

Indeed, whenCampbell Palmersmells castoreum in her research in Great Britain, she knows right away “there’s probably two families here, and they’re telling each other, ‘This is the line. This is my boundary,’” says Campbell-Palmer, head of restoration atBeaver Trust, a U.K.-based organization dedicated to increasing Eurasian beaver populations.

Read how beavers are bouncing back in Sweden.

“It’s a very distinctive smell, castoreum…it’s kind of musky, but sweet,” says Campbell-Palmer. “Even if you don’t see beavers about, you know they’re there.”

Related beavers can also recognize their family members’ individual castoreum scents, which is also a useful tool for Campbell-Palmer.

When she wants to trap and relocate a family of beavers, she can extract one animal’s castoreum and put it in a humane trap to attract its relatives.

“They’re doing very well inBritain,” Campbell-Palmer adds. “They’re adapting readily.” TheNorth American speciesis also rebounding, thanks to habitat preservation and hunting controls.

If castoreum were ever to appear in something you ate, Francl says not to worry.

“When we’re thinking about food, what really matters is the structures of the molecules,” says Francl. “It doesn’t matter whether it comes from bear or it comes from beaver, it’s the same molecule—it does the same thing.”

TheU.S. Food and Drug Administrationclassifies castoreum as “generally regarded as safe,” and a 2007 safety assessment published in theInternational Journal of Toxicologyconcluded that “a long historical use of castoreum extract as a flavoring and fragrance ingredient has resulted in no reports of human adverse reactions.”

“I would try it,” Francl says. But “probably not in ice cream.”

4,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/rare-penguins-galapagos-islands-heat,"These birds have evolved to withstand the equatorial sun and shelter in volcanic rocks along a subtropical coastline. After 50 years, biologist Dee Boersma continues to learn new things about the species.

Roughly 600 milesoff the coast of mainland Ecuador, conservation biologist Dee Boersma cruised in an inflatable Zodiac through the blue waters surrounding Bartolomé Island, a small part of the Pacific Ocean archipelago known as theGalápagos Islands. She was joined by several other scientists, all of whom scanned the shoreline for an elusive black-and-white seabird. Standing about a foot and a half tall, Galápagos penguins are the rarest and among the smallest penguins in the world. But most notably, they are the only ones living at the Equator, existing on these volcanic islands in the blazing hot sun.

“How could you not fall in love with these birds?” asked the 78-year-old director of the University of Washington’s Center for Ecosystem Sentinels and a National Geographic Explorer. “They’re comical, they’re curious, they’re endearing.”

Boersma suddenly pointed to five penguins near a cave. Then another, and another. Seven in total. Once the boat got close enough to shore, two Ecuadorians, veterinarian M. Gavilanes Escobar and park guard Marlon Ramón, leaped out, easily scaling the sharp and slippery rocks. In less than five minutes, Escobar was back, lightly gripping a penguin under its chin with one hand and propping its feet in his other. He passed it to Boersma, who was ready with her calipers to ascertain the size of the bird’s bill and feet. Then she pulled out her yellow tape measure to discern the length of the bird’s wingspan. “We’re measuring him for a suit,” she joked.

(The Galapagos penguin, one of the world's rarest, sees a glimmer of hope.)

These were the first steps in the process of recording information that allows researchers to monitor the health of the colony in this area. Next, Boersma cinched a red cord around the penguin’s chest and attached it to a scale. Now the flightless bird was dangling in midair, flippers whirling. “That’s a big one,” she told her colleague Caroline Cappello, a wildlife ecologist who has studied penguins in the Galápagos alongside Boersma for more than a decade. Cappello recorded the data: a little more than five pounds and likely a male. Freeing the feisty bird from the cord, Boersma then secured its head between her left forearm and knee in a well-practiced maneuver to protect her legs from painful bites. “You’re all right. You’re all right,” she told the squirming penguin. “You’re so soft. Yes, you are. Calm down. We’re going to let you go in just a minute.”

The penguin’s flippers, thick at the top and tapered to a thin trailing edge, ideally shaped for soaring through water, were in great condition, she noted, smoothing them with her hands protected by beige wool fingerless gloves. She affixed a tiny metal tag into the webbing of its left foot and gently set it down on the edge of the Zodiac. Seemingly unfazed by the ordeal, the penguin surveyed the water, then leaned forward and quietly plopped into the Pacific to again swim amonggreen sea turtlesandmarine iguanas. “Touching a bird like that is electric,” Boersma said as she watched it vanish beneath the surface.

It is also an increasingly rare opportunity for researchers. Today Galápagos penguins join the more than half of all penguin species that are classified as endangered or vulnerable, imperiled by such threats aswarming temperatures,overfishing, habitat destruction, andpollution. Boersma, who has been called theJane Goodallof penguins, considers these birds to be marine sentinels—or canaries in a coal mine—describing how one species’ rapid decline signals a significant natural or human-made change happening within its environment.

Still, she believes that the species has the capacity to hang on, in part because researchers continue to gain a better understanding of how these creatures leverage centuries of adaptations to be resilient in the increasingly unpredictable world around them. “Fifty-four years ago, when I started this, I thought Galápagos penguins would be gone by now,” she said. “But they’re still here.”

The Galápagospenguins’ evolutionary journey illustrates how environmental pressures shape species over millions of years. Genetic studies suggest they descended fromHumboldt penguinsroughly two million years ago during the Pleistocene epoch, a period marked by wide-ranging climatic changes. The earliestGalápagos penguinancestors probably came to the islands by surfing the northbound Humboldt Current that brings cold, nutrient-rich water along the coast of South America. Likely settling on the western part of the archipelago, on Isabela andFernandina Islands, the penguins found plentiful food and shelter. While the Humboldt and another current, the Cromwell, still flow here, they now bring nutrients and food intermittently in duration and intensity.

One of the significant factors to how Galápagos penguins adapted to living in this warm climate is that they nest in cool, shady crevices on the islands. The coastlines are sculpted by explosivevolcanic eruptionsand erosion, providing cracks and lava tunnels where penguins can avoid overheating. Their small stature allows them to squeeze into these dark places where they and their chicks hide from predators such as Galápagos snakes andSally Lightfoot crabs.

With a thinner layer of fat and fewer feathers than most other penguins, these birds evolved for life in the subtropics. Galápagos penguins, along with the Humboldt, Magellanic, andAfrican species, belong to a group known as banded penguins for the distinctive black-and-white patterning around their chests and heads. They all live in warmer climates and regulate their body temperature by panting, similar to a dog on a hot day, and they stand with their flippers outstretched to release heat. White feathers on Galápagos penguins’ faces and their featherless ankles and feet further help shunt warmth from their stout little bodies. The birds can also shed feathers around their faces during hot periods.

But the adaptation that sets Galápagos penguins apart is their flexibility as to when theymolt(replace feathers) and breed, rather than having one fixed molting and mating season as other penguin species do. The timing is based on whether enough nutrients are being delivered from cool ocean currents and upwellings to give them energy to replace their feathers, which, unlike other penguins’ cycles, occurs before breeding and up to twice a year. They can delay molting and mating until food is available and there’s a better chance of successfully starting a family.

All this adds up to a boom-or-bust way of life. By tracking and measuring Galápagos penguins’ weight and population numbers over decades, Boersma made the incredible discovery that their breeding is tightly in sync with the rhythms ofEl Niñosand La Niñas. The birds thrive during La Niña conditions, when there are strong currents of cold, nutrient-rich water flowing north, providing plentiful fish, squid, and crustaceans for the penguins. When El Niño’s warm water in the central and eastern Pacific displaces the cool currents, it drastically reduces upwelling and their food supply. In years when provisions are scarce, some penguins starve and breeding comes to a standstill. It can take decades for the population to recover. During a severe El Niño in the early 1980s, the population fell by more than half.

Now, as global temperatures heat up, El Niños are becoming more frequent and extreme, threatening to further reduce the availability of nutrients, while rising sea levels are inundating nesting sites. Still, Boersma has come to believe that even with the increasing frequency of El Niños and extreme weather events, some Galápagos penguins will persist because their ecosystem is also supported by periodic deepwater upwellings bringing pulses of nutrients to sustain the food chain. “But if for some reason the currents change and productivity goes down,” she said, “they’ll have trouble because there will be nowhere left for them to go but Peru or Chile—and that’s a long swim.”

Boersma estimates there are maybe 2,000 Galápagos penguins left, less than half as many as there were 50 years ago when she started her trailblazing research. But she believes that a couple of crucial actions can protect their future.

In order to surviveand thrive, Galápagos penguins need humans to help them overcome two major threats: introduced predators, mainly rats and cats, and natural nesting areas becoming increasingly inhospitable.

Solving the first issue is fairly straightforward. Cats and rats arrived inthe Galápagosnearly 200 years ago with sailors and whalers. They can easily scale difficult terrain and squeeze into nests of penguins and other seabirds, devouring eggs and chicks. Recently, the Galápagos National Park partnered with environmental organization Jocotoco to undertake an invasive species eradication program on Floreana Island, in the southern part of the archipelago. In October 2023, park managers began exterminating the rats and cats on Floreana, using traps and unmanned ultralight helicopters to disperse pellets of rodenticide and toxin-laced sausages across the entire island. The program appears to be working. Previously, a small number of penguins remained in the area, Boersma said, “but not easily.” Removing the predators and continuing to monitor for their presence will give “penguins a fair shot at long-term survival.”

To mitigate the second threat, Boersma and her colleagues are hoping to obtain funding to build artificial nests and help the birds recolonize Floreana. Boersma first began thinking about constructing nests some years ago when she was puzzled by a penguin pair nesting on top of lava along the western edge of the archipelago on Fernandina Island, without any shade. The birds took turns sitting on the eggs from early evening until morning, but then retreated during the heat of the day, leaving the eggs unprotected. Eventually, the eggs died. Boersma realized that there weren’t enough shaded nest sites to go around, and that might be limiting how many baby penguins could join the population each year.

Fifteen years ago, she began experimenting with artificial-nest designs that would blend into the environment so they wouldn’t mar the islands’ natural beauty. “The park didn’t want doggy igloos or something like what they use at zoos,” she said. One option was an inconspicuous little penguin carport made from stacked lava rocks. The other—the one the penguins wound up preferring—was created by digging cavernous holes directly into the hard lava substrate. As in all real estate, location was key: The nests needed to be close to the water but not so close that they’d flood within the penguins’ three-month nesting period. “The idea of building nests,” Boersma said, “is that if conditions are good, you want everybody that wants to breed to be able to breed.”

On the third dayof the expedition, Boersma and her team arrived at Punta Espinoza on Fernandina Island, the first place Boersma had ever tried to build the artificial nests. They disembarked from the Zodiac and walked carefully across the sharp lava slathered with iguana poop. Two members located and checked the nest sites: Cappello, 35, who is currently doing postdoctoral research at Cornell University, and Aura Banda Cruz, 42, a third-generation resident of the Galápagos and a naturalist working aboard the Silversea cruise ship that hosted Boersma’s survey while ferrying tourists around the Galápagos.

Peering into a small space between a pile of rocks, Cappello shouted that she’d found an artificial nest that appeared to have been used recently. There were shards of broken eggshells and downy feathers scattered around the area. “Maybe it hatched, or maybe it was predated,” Cappello said as she slipped the eggshells into a coin envelope for closer inspection later. Regardless, any sign of nesting activity was good news.

In her work as a cruise ship naturalist, Banda Cruz has spent nearly a decade photographing Galápagos penguins. That has led her to develop a noninvasive method to identify individuals, using the distinctive patterns of spots on their chests. “I realized that the spots were different on each one of them,” she said. “Each one is unique, like a fingerprint.” Similarly, researchers have learned to identify jaguars, zebras, dolphins, and even koalas by their distinguishing patterns.

Banda Cruz is hopeful that going forward, in the periods between annual surveys like this one, she can partner with other expedition naturalists who will send more photographs, helping create a visual archive that can be used to discern penguins when they’re sighted. The images can also provide records of the birds’ overall health and the ratio of adults to juveniles. “You can tell the adults because they have a white line around their cheek and their feet are black,” Banda Cruz said. “Juveniles have paler feet and white cheeks.”

What’s more, the photos help document periods in which the penguins are working harder for their food, often correlating with an El Niño. “They start spending more time in the water,” Banda Cruz said. “They don’t have time to dry completely and they start growing algae, so when you see a green penguin, it’s a symbol that things are not going well for them.”

For her part, Boersma is thrilled to still be learning new things about the lives of Galápagos penguins, especially from this next generation of scientists. For a long time she worried that she wouldn’t have anyone to take over her Galápagos research when she retired. “You realize when you’re jumping and crawling around on the lava that your days are numbered—you can’t do this forever,” she said, sitting on the edge of the Zodiac while her colleagues checked another area for penguins and signs of nesting. “That’s why I was so happy to find first Caroline and now Aura. I think they can make a dynamic team and carry it on for another 10, 20, 30 years if they want.”

She went quiet, watching a male penguin standing alone along the shore, basking in the late afternoon’s golden light.Awwwwww, awwwwwww,the penguin brayed, trying to attract a mate.“Awwwwww, awwwwwww,”Boersma called back. “He’s saying, ‘Come see my etchings. I’ve got a good nest. Come take a look,’ ” she said, grinning.

If the conditions stayed as favorable as they’d been in recent weeks—cold water and lots of fish—she felt confident: “He’ll be breeding soon.”

6,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/whale-communication-legal-personhood,"Scientists are closer than ever to deciphering sperm whale communication. Their breakthroughs could open the door to expanded whale rights and even legal personhood.

Two summers ago, in the turquoise waters off the coast of a small Caribbean island called Dominica, asperm whalenamed Rounderbegan to give birth. Eleven members of her clan slowly gathered around to support her, converging from miles away in their home waters. They called to one another in choruses of Morse code-like clicks as they waited for the baby to arrive and in the hours that followed, when they held the calf above water so that she could breathe, only lowering her when her fins finished unfurling. Soon after, they departed.

Scientists aredeveloping innovationsin recording and analyzing sperm whale communications that could someday make it possible to understand at least some of what whales say to each other in these extraordinary moments. People might translate what they only now surmise: expressions of care and joy, arrangements of duties, cries of pain and discomfort. With those translations would come profound and surprising legal questions.

Might a richer understanding of whatsperm whalessay breathe new life into laws that presently offer only incomplete, often-unenforced protections? Could legal systems recognize whales aspersons, their interests so important as to be accorded formal rights? “I think we’re just now on the cusp of this immense legal world,” saysDavid Gruber, a marine biologist and National Geographic Explorer.

Gruber is the founder and president ofProject CETI(Cetacean Translation Initiative), which has gathered dozens of linguists, biologists, roboticists, and experts in artificial intelligence to document the lives and communications of Dominica’s sperm whales. Their work builds on several decades of findings in the field of animal communication—not only in sperm whales but throughout the animal world, from songbird syntax to chimpanzee gestures and river turtle repertoires. Gruber’s team isworking to translate whale conversationwith an unprecedented richness and detail. They hope to eventually develop a communication translation tool for cetaceans, which would convert sperm whale sounds into human words and vice versa.

(What are animals saying? AI may help decode their languages.)

Already, Gruber and his colleagues—César Rodríguez-Garavitoand Ashley Otilia Nemeth of theMore-than-Human Rights (MoTH) Projectat New York University and CETI linguistics leadGašper Begušof the University of California, Berkeley—are beginning to anticipate some of the legal implications of this work.

Ina new working paperthat is expected to be published later this fall in the journal Ecology Law Quarterly, the researchers note that one result might be a world in which humans “undeniably understand” these creatures’ experience from their own perspective. “Such insights could provide a groundwork for new laws and inform how existing laws regulate actions that impact cetaceans,” they write. This framework, they hope, will inspire a new way of thinking about the law that is rooted in the way whales experience the world.

Consider, for instance,the problemof ocean noise pollution.For creatures like sperm whales, who rely upon echolocation to find food and to navigate, and who remain in near-constant vocal contact with family and friends, sound is paramount. Humanity’s growing aquatic din—oil and gas exploration, construction, military sonar, and most of all ship engine noise—is a clear harm, disrupting the basic activities of sperm whale life.

“We have very good evidence of the impacts,” says Rodríguez-Garavito, yet that evidence has yielded piecemeal progress. The federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act—the bedrock of cetacean protections in the United States—provide a legal framework for preventing harms, but government agencies have mostly neglected to apply rules against harming cetaceans to cases of noise-induced harm. The same toothlessness holds for other attempts to curb underwater noise, such as new regulations passed in the European Union and by the International Maritime Organization.

But what if whales were documented not only straining to make themselves heard above the racket, but actually talking about it? Were a sperm whale heard articulating the pain and difficulty caused by a ship’s eardrum-rattling, echolocation-scrambling engine noise, their words would likely carry more weight in a court of law than do human descriptions of the problem. Being able to present the whales’ own testimony, so to speak, might move—or shame—government agencies and judges to action. It “would help us make more of a convincing case,” says Rodríguez-Garavito, and a deeper understanding of sperm whale communication could inspire even farther-reaching legal claims.

Animal advocates and conservationists might be able to argue that near-constant physical and psychological stress caused by chronic noise pollution actually violate the spirit of international prohibitions against torture. Sensory deprivation and overstimulation are already recognized as torturous for humans; recognizing the same for whales could lead to new, more urgent protections.

Advocates could also assert that by disrupting communication and social activities, noise pollution interferes with sperm whale culture—and that the whales should qualify, again in spirit if not in letter, for recognitions afforded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which enshrines a right to participation in cultural life.

After all, culture—socially transmitted information that is passed between generations—is already known to be a significant feature of sperm whale life. Different clans have different dialects, lifestyles, and social customs. Even when their waters overlap, clan members often keep to themselves, and their structure resembles that of human tribes. But those are coarse descriptions; to learn about the whales’ cultures through their own words would provide a finer understanding of them. It would put a sharper point on what is lost when humans destroy those cultures or remove individuals from them—by hitting them with ships, hunting them for profit, or capturing them for entertainment.

Perhaps that deeper, first-person understanding could again lead to new protections or reinforce existing ones. Maybe advocates will be able to call not merely for protections, but true rights: the explicit legal recognition of an interest as profoundly, inviolably important.

That leads to the topic of legal personhood, defined by the late Steven Wise, founder of the Nonhuman Rights Project, as the capacity to have any rights at all. In the United States, rights are exclusively human. No animal has ever been accorded a full legal right; although laws against cruelty and the mistreatment of animals provide some protections, they have neither the force nor versatility offered by rights.



The Nonhuman Rights Project has tried to cross that legal divide by filing lawsuits seeking the release of captive chimpanzees and elephants. The lawsuits draw on scientific research showing how those species share the mental capacities—including rich forms of self-awareness, emotions, and society, and the ability to plan for the future and make choices—that in humans give rise to autonomy and thus underlie our right to be free from arbitrary imprisonment. As a matter of equality, Nonhuman Rights Project lawyers argue this right should be extended to chimpanzees and elephants as well.

Courts have so far rejected that argument, and among their stated justifications is the idea that in order to have rights, one must also be able to bear social responsibilities and legal duties: the right to liberty comes with a duty not to break the law. Rodríguez-Garavito and his co-authors suggest that Project CETI’s work could illuminate how sperm whales negotiate their own social responsibilities, such as helping mothers deliver and protect their babies, thus establishing them as duty-bearers in the law’s eyes.

Translating the caregiving arrangements whales make with each other will not likely satisfy reluctant judges, though. Spencer Lo, an attorney with the Nonhuman Rights Project, noted that judges already dismiss scientific evidence of social responsibilities fulfilled by chimpanzees and elephants. Instead those animals are found wanting in their inability to explicitly understand human legal codes—an expectation that is not applied to babies or people with severe dementia, who are similarly unable to understand laws but still have rights. That double standard speaks to the essential discomfort most judges have with the idea of animal personhood. And even when courts don’t cite the “rights and duties” standard, they have found other rationales.

Those rejections are ultimately rooted in the belief that “humans are qualitatively—and thus morally and legally—distinct from all nonhuman animals,” says Lo. He thinks that Project CETI’s work, and that of other researchers deciphering complex animal communication, has “transformative potential,” but not because it will reinforce any particular legal argument. Rather, that potential resides in its power “to undermine human exceptionalism and thereby bolster the case for personhood.”

Yet despite their courtroom struggles, the Nonhuman Rights Project has arguably triumphed in the court of public opinion. Understanding sperm whale communication may not lead directly to new laws or precedents—but it should still nourish empathy and care.

(How scientists are piecing together a sperm whale ‘alphabet’.)

Even as U.S. courtshave refused to recognize animals as persons, however, jurisdictions elsewhere have been more open-minded. In recent years, judges in several countries have declared that some animals should be considered persons; in Panama, for example, sea turtles now have a federally recognized right to freedom from human harm, and Ecuador’s highest court took the extraordinary step of declaring that all animals are legal persons. Discussion is now ongoing about the rights that each species deserves.

Kristen Stilt, faculty director of Harvard University’s animal law program, used the analogy of fluid flowing through pipes to illustrate how better understandings of animal communication could lead to legal change. In the United States, she says, new information flows through “a couple little straws,” but in places that are open-minded to animal rights, “it’s like you’ve got this massive pipe, and all this [information] can flow in all these different directions.”

Leading scientists and legal scholars are already considering the potential harms of this technology. “In the miraculous event that we do eventually ‘crack the code,’” says Philippa Brakes, a behavioral ecologist at Massey University in Australia, “there are issues such as the potential for communications with wildlife to be used for nefarious purposes.”

Gruber agrees and adds that technology developed by Project CETI and other researchers could be turned to ill not only by people who want to harm whales, but by well-intentioned yet careless people. He is especially troubled by the thought of people “racing to try some of these fancy new AI tools""—tools that not only translate whale communication but mimic it—without fully understanding what is being communicated.

(Your biggest AI questions, answered.)

“We must still grapple with the potential impacts of its research and what its findings may equip others to do,” the MOTH and CETI teams write. The possibility should be “understood as a clarion call for ethical and legal safeguards.”

Stilt has even more fundamental reservations. If complex animal communication and our ability to translate it becomes the basis for ethical regard, a bar that animals must clear for their interests to be recognized, it would “take us backwards,” she says. That would give people an excuse for failing to act on what is already known about animals, the harms we cause, and how we should treat them, regardless of whether they speak in a suitably human-like way.

The paper's co-authors share those reservations too. “Why must nonhuman animals resemble humans for us to empathize with their pain and safeguard their well-being?” they write. “Must they articulate their suffering when we already possess a clear understanding of the injuries we cause?”

The quest to find and translate complex animal communication should not diminish the worth of creatures who don’t appear to have those capacities, says Rodríguez-Garavito. We may simply fail to appreciate their intelligence; and the lack of rich communication does not make any life less special. But it would still be incredible, and perhaps transformative, to know whatsperm whalessay—and this could be seen as an entry point, a beginning rather than a destination, on the journey to appreciating all creatures.

7,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/oldest-hell-ant-fossil-discovery,"This fossil is 13 million years older than any ant fossil found before—and reveals a sophisticated predator that lived alongside the dinosaurs.

The oldest ant fossil ever discovered had forward-facing scythe-like jaws it used to hunt, according to a new study inCurrent Biology.

Now the oldestantspecimen known to science, the roughly half-inch-long113-million-year-old impression preserved in limestone was found in northeastern Brazil,and is a new genus belonging to the “hell ant” subfamily Haidomyrmecinae. Hell ants only lived during the Cretaceous period, which ended 66 million years ago.

Modern ants are one of the most dominant animal groups on Earth, withover 17,000 ant speciesfound throughout every continent except Antarctica. Scientists think ants diverged from the evolutionary lineage that wasps originated from, then took on a more ant-like form during theCretaceous periodwith a smaller thorax and a specialized secreting gland unique to ants.

The newly identified specimen was part of a collection of insectfossilsfrom a fossil-rich stone quarry known as the Crato Formation, and housed at the University of São Paulo’s Zoology Museum. The research team used 3D imaging to view inside the well-preserved specimen and identify its spot on ants’ evolutionary tree.

“I didn’t believe I could find something like that,” saysAnderson Lepeco,entomologist at the University of São Paulo’s Zoology Museum and author of the new paper. “There has never been definitive evidence that ants occurred in this collection, but now we found this very complete specimen.”

Lepeco adds that this flying ant could have been dragged by the wind and fallen into a lake, before being covered by millions of years’ worth of sediment.

Hell ant fossils indicate early ants evolved sophisticated predatory strategies. Their bizarre jaws paired with a horn on their headwere probably used topin down or impaleother insects before eating them,allowing them to capture relatively large prey.

“It’s a very unusual kind of mandible that you can’t find in any [living] insect today,” says Lepeco. Scientists have speculated that hell ants could have used these mandibles to grab drops of water or nectar to transport to their nest and feed larvae, but using them to grab or impale insects is the more likely theory, thinks Lepeco.

One hell ant fossil from Myanmarwas found with an insect in its mandibles, held between the jaws and the horn.The new fossil is also the first evidence discovered of hell ants on Gondwana, the prehistoric Southern Hemisphere megacontinent.

The previous oldest hell ant fossils werefound in Myanmar, preserved in amber and about 100 million years old, and others have been found inCanadaandFrance, which all would have been part of the Northern Hemisphere megacontinent Laurasia.

“It’s remarkable how ants not only diversified into a lot of niches and shapes early in their history, but also that they had a large capacity for migrating through continents and spreading throughout the globe,” says Lepeco.During the boom of ant diversification in the Cretaceous, unique ant lineages like the hell ant emerged thatultimately left no descendantsafter the transition from theCretaceous to the Cenozoic eraabout 66 million years ago—when the K-Pg extinction event occurred, best known as when an asteroid struck Earth and around76 percent of lifeon Earth went extinct.“Hell ants disappear from the fossil record in the late Cretaceous 78 million years ago, and fossil deposits close to the K-Pg extinction boundary 66 million years ago as of yet don't have any hell ants,” saysChristine Sosiak,entomologist at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, who was not involved with the new research. “It is possible that they went extinct during the K-Pg extinction alongside the dinosaurs, but… a bit more plausible that they may have gone extinct before then. The Cretaceous was a time of ecological and climatic change.”

Throughout this period of change, hell ants’ specialized form of hunting could have been their downfall, saysMarek Borowiec, entomologist at Colorado State University, who was not involved in the new research.

“We don’t know how specialized they were… but that might be something that contributed to their extinction,” says Borowiec, “because if they had very particular types of food and could only hunt those, that diminishes the ability to diversify and survive if that food is gone.”

The fossil is a puzzle piece that can help paleontologists better understand insects that existed in the past—it's a new datapoint that allows scientists to discern which traits in ant and wasp evolution occurred when, says Lepeco.

“From previous fossil records, we know that hell ants were successful and diverse, occurring in three continents over 20 million years,” says Sosiak, “so this new hell ant really reinforces this pattern, expanding their geographic and temporal diversity.”

The fossil also tells a more detailed story of what the world looked like in the Cretaceous period.

“We can imagine a more complex picture of the age of dinosaurs… there were incredible insects such as hell ants living together with them, that had very specialized behaviors and anatomies,” says Lepeco. “People often think only about great dinosaurs, mammals, and huge animals that we find as fossils, but insects are also remarkable.”

8,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/feral-camels-australia-outback,"These 1,000-pound creatures travel in large herds and can smell water miles away. Now, the race is on to stop them from inundating Australia’s fragile ecosystems—one camel burger at a time.

Jack Carmody has builta sizable YouTube following by showing his viewers what it takes to run a cattle station in the Australian outback—the rugged work of mending troughs, reinforcing fences, and shooting trespassers. Feral horses and donkeys, that is, and one particularly destructive invasive species:camels. Introduced in the 19th century to help colonists survey the country’s vast interior, the creatures are now wreaking havoc across the outback and decimating the Carmody family’s ranch property, or what Australians call a cattle station. At more than 1,500 square miles, the property—Prenti Downs—is the size of Rhode Island, so there’s plenty of work to be done, and in this modern internet age, there’s plenty of content to be created.

On Carmody’s channel,Jack Out The Back, no videos are more popular than those focused on his fight against the camels, which the straight-talking father of three culls with his rifle, taking out nearly 800 each year. The approach might seem alarming, but to Carmody and other cattle farmers, it’s simply the most rational solution to a dire problem, “like weeding the veggie patch,” as he puts it. And in a twist that is perhaps good for YouTube and bad for cattle farming, the camels, like stubborn weeds, keep coming back.

Australia is now home to the world’s largest feral camel population, with estimates from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. Females can give birth every two years and live up to 40 years in the wild, meaning the number of camels can double every nine years. Weighing an average of 1,000 pounds, they roam in herds from fewer than 10 to several hundred, trampling ecosystems and destroying infrastructure. The creatures are voracious consumers of plants, competing with other wildlife and livestock, and limiting food sources for Aboriginal communities. They destabilize sand dunes, which can lead to erosion. Camels also foul water holes with their droppings or by mobbing them, only to die of thirst, their carcasses poisoning what little water is left.

(Meet the animals that can handle extreme heat.)

Water, in fact, is the source of the biggest problem. When enough moisture-rich plants are available, camels, famously, can subsist for weeks on end without a drink. But when they do get thirsty, they’re insatiable. An adult camel can consume 50 gallons in a day. When natural sources of water dry up on Aboriginal land, pastoral territory, and cattle stations, camels go looking for a drink wherever they can find it. In the process, they often rip up pipes, destroy toilet blocks, and knock airconditioners out of windows.

What’s even more concerning is that a rising number of droughts is pushing the animals into ever closer and more frequent contact with humans. One of the most damaging of these conflicts occurred in 2013 on a Northern Territory cattle station named Curtin Springs. Six years earlier, feral camels desperate for a drink wrecked a hundred miles of the station’s fencing. “And I mean just totally destroyed,” says Lyndee Severin, who runs the farm with her family. “Gone.” Replacing the fencing cost about half a million dollars. Ranchers have a legal obligation to remove feral animals on their property; when she saw the camels were back, Severin called theAustralian Feral Camel Management Project, which had culled 27,000 camels from the region the previous year. Within 48 hours snipers arrived at the property, and over the next four days they shot 1,700 camels dead from their helicopters.

But the federal camel-culling program, budgeted for four years, ended in 2013, with little political will in cities to keep the distant outback project going. And feral camel numbers have only gone up. According to biologist Tim Low, co-founder of Australia’sInvasive Species Council, a private nonprofit, the current impact of feral camels on farmers and ruralAboriginal Australiansis “very substantial.” Costs in damage and control, last estimated at $12 million in 2013, are unknown today. Low and other experts say if they can’t get the population under control, the country’s next droughts will lead to more crises.



There are plenty of ideas,both practical and fanciful, for what to do with the feral camels, but it’s helpful to understand why they were brought to Australia in the first place. In the 1830s, Britishcolonists—struggling to survey the outback on horses that tired easily—got word of camels’ extraordinary endurance. The first camel to enter the country arrived in 1840 from the Canary Islands, and others followed from Arabia, Afghanistan, British India, and thePersianandOttoman Empires. Colonists also brought in more than 2,000 camel operators, or cameleers, whom they collectively called Afghans despite their disparate origins. Camels helped open the remote interior, transporting food and supplies, as well as gold prospectors and workers building railway and telegraph systems. Then the “white Australia” policy, enacted in 1901 to prevent non-Europeans from immigrating, began to thin the number of cameleers, as would technology. By the 1930s, cars and railroads had rendered Australia’s camel industry all but obsolete. Many foreign cameleers returned to their homelands, and their camels, up to 10,000 of them, suddenly jobless, were set free to roam.

(The sinister reason why camels were brought to the American West.)

One traditional use for these wayward animals is to enlist them in the camel trekking industry, which offers a ruggedly authentic way for travelers to see some of the most remote parts of Australia’s interior. Camel trekking was made famous by Robyn Davidson’s 1980 memoir,Tracks,about her solo 1,700-mile journey by camel across the deserts of western Australia, and the industry now comprises a dozen operators. One of the longest running is the Outback Camel Company. Andrew Harper, who has owned the outfit since 2000 and has 21 camels, estimates that fewer than a hundred camels around the country are being used for trekking. “We’re governed by the seasons,” says Harper. And with limited numbers of people wanting to make desert treks, “it’s not like your normal business model [focused on] exponential growth.”

But there’s also a more dramatic way to ride feral camels, one that like the animals themselves has been imported from abroad. Each year, more than 4,000 people visit the Queensland village of Boulia (population under 500), which hosts one of Australia’s most famous camel-racing tournaments, a competition where the purse totals some $30,000. The animals are temperamental: Few heats pass without a buck or a bite, and any jockeys worth their salt have the scars to prove it. “Every single camel has got a different personality,” says jockey Brettlyn “Beaver” Neal. “You hope you get a good start. And, yeah, hold on.”

Camel trekker Paddy McHugh founded theBoulia Camel Racesin 1997. It remains a modest enterprise, as does the entire domestic racing circuit, which has only about a hundred camels in competition. But McHugh thinks that figure could grow tenfold. A Formula One–style circuit could connect Australian races with contests in North Africa and in the Persian Gulf, whereracing camelscan be worth over a million dollars. In Saudi Arabia, perhaps the sport’s global capital, the 2024 Crown Prince Camel Festival featured more than 21,000 camels and a staggering prize pot of $15 million.

McHugh is a realist, though, and thinks the only way to solve Australia’s camel problem is to market the creature’s varied attributes. “The camel is so underrated,” he says. “We need to lift that profile and make it another great industry for Australia.” Opposed to culling, like some Aboriginal communities and animal welfare groups, he’s upset by the “mindless slaughter” of this “great animal.”

Camels are remarkably versatile: Unlike most any other animal that you can race up to 40 miles an hour, they can also be milked.Camel milk, which is creamy and slightly salty, offers a nutritious, low-fat, and low-lactose alternative to cow’s milk. Australia’s camel milk production, 50,000 gallons a year at last available count, is a drop in the proverbial bucket compared with 634 million gallons in cow’s milk sales today. But it’s an emerging cottage industry. TheCamel Milk Co.,founded north of Melbourne in 2014, now has a milking herd of more than 200 at its dairy.Summer Land Camels, an organic farm in Queensland where 800 camels graze, vaunts the benefits of the vitamin C–rich milk and offers a range of other dairy products, from feta to gelato, body cream to milk vodka. Elsewhere in Queensland,QCamelis producing camel’s milk chocolates.

There are, of course, significant challenges to scaling these operations to such a degree that they could make a dent in the country’s huge feral population. As Warwick Hill of South Australia–based camel dairyHumpaliciousexplains, animals bred for milking typically have uniform teat and udder sizes. Nobody’s made any serious efforts to breed camels for conformity to machinery, he says. “The time it takes us to milk a dozen camels, a cow dairy could probably be putting through 500.”

One of Humpalicious’s products, jerky, points toward another potential solution: camel meat, which is a $1.6 billion global enterprise (an industry report projects it will swell to $2.2 billion by 2030), with major markets in the Middle East and Africa. Camel meat is already having a moment. An episode of the new Australian TV showEat the Invadersurged viewers to try it. Businesses already taking advantage of the demand include artisanal enterprises and large firms such asSamex, a meat exporter in Adelaide, and New South Wales’sFettayleh Foods, a wholesale and retail meat products supplier for the domestic market that offers camel burger patties.

Like camel dairy, camel meat is a niche business in Australia: Its camel-meat industry produces a few hundred tons a year, a far cry from the nearly three million tons of beef it produces. But Eddie Hopkins, CEO of Camel Export Australia, says there’s a growing demand abroad for the country’s camel meat, particularly in the United States. He’s fielded requests for more than 25 tons a week—about 200 camels’ worth—from grocers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, home to a large Somali community for whom the animal is a staple source of meat and milk. Hopkins thinks those requests are just “scraping the surface” and believes the actual weekly demand, globally, to be closer to 1,200 camels, making him optimistic about the industry’s long-term prospects.

Carmody, the rancher and YouTuber, also hopes to sell some of the 130 tons of camel meat that his culls could yield annually. In one recent video, he slices off the fatty hump of a dromedary to access the meat underneath it, explaining he sometimes also makes cuts from the legs and shoulders for sausages. But it’s a lot of work, and he wonders whether enough customers will be willing to pay the necessary premium. After all, it’s painstaking and expensive to cull the animals in the desert and transport them for processing. “It’s just horrendously cost prohibitive,” Carmody says, “and it’s cheaper just to shoot them all.”

A number of experts agree that a commercial camel-meat industry could never reach the scale needed to solve the problem. Biologist Tim Low, of the Invasive Species Council, argues that focusing on industries that harvest camels will only create resistance to necessary culling, which he sees as the sole practical solution. Carmody, for his part, says he can’t even cull camels efficiently, with semiautomatic weapons, thanks to a statewide ban on the firearms that’s been the subject of several Jack Out The Back videos. “I’m letting everyone know exactly what’s going on and how little we are supported,” he says. “We’re being told that we’re a threat to society if we have access to tools to do the job. But we’re actually doing something we have to do.”

Recently, Carmody was flying up from Australia’s southern coast toward home when, less than an hour into the flight, he spotted a small herd of camels heading toward a farming zone. “It’s not just an out-the-back problem,” he says. “It’s going to start becoming a problem down on the coast.”

But for now, it’s outback cattle stations like Carmody’s and Severin’s that remain at the heart of the crisis. To keep feral camels in check, Severin holds about 50 at a time that she’s rounded up, until they are mature enough to be sold for slaughter. “We don’t like to shoot to waste,” she says. But her patience is wearing thin, and she fears another clash is on the horizon. It’s not “if they’ll come back,” she says. “They will come back.” The real question is what the inhabitants of the outback are prepared to do about it.

9,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/female-bonobos-fight-male-aggression,"The key to keeping males in line? Joining forces.

Why do female bonobos often outrank males, especially when the opposite is true for most social mammals, like their close relative the chimpanzee?

That’s the questionMartin Surbeckand his colleagues wanted to answer. And after monitoring six communities of bonobos in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for nearly three decades, they have arrived at a conclusion.

By banding together in coalitions—meaning groups of two or more animals, but usually three to five—female bonobos both reduce the danger posed by males and catapult themselves into positions of influence. Fully 85 percent of cases of female coalitionary aggression were directed at males, which also tend to be larger than females.

“We have found what everybody already knows—that when you work together, you’re more successful and you gain power,” says Surbeck, a behavioral ecologist at Harvard University and lead author of astudypublished today in the journalCommunications Biology.

“In bonobo communities, females have a lot to say. And that's very different from chimpanzee communities where all adult males outrank all females in the group, and where sexually attractive females receive a lot of aggression…by the males,” says Surbeck.

The study makes use of “an impressive data set” to provide “an exciting new window into how female bonobos build and maintain power,” saysLaura Simone Lewis, a biological anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not affiliated with the research.

“As bonobos are our closest living relatives along with chimpanzees, these data also provide support for the idea that humans and our ancestors have likely used coalitions to build and maintain power for millions of years,” says Lewis.

The six communities of bonobos observed for the study each showed different levels of female cooperation and dominance. “There is substantial variation in this trait of female power within groups, and we found that coalition formation in females seems to explain a lot of the variation,” says Surbeck.

Surbeck and his colleagues measured “rank” within the communities by tallying how many times females won conflicts with males, as well as by evaluating the percentage of males in a group that were outranked by females. For instance, while male chimpanzees are always dominant over females, female bonobos outranked 70 percent of the males in their communities. And all of this varied across sites and over time.

In 1998, the females of the Eyengo community never once backed down from or were outranked by a male, and the same was mostly true for the females in the Kokolopori group in 2020; they dominated 98.4 percent of conflicts with males. However, in a mysterious twist in the Ekalakala community, males were made to submit to females just 18.2 percent of the time in 2016.

The difference between groups? When females gave each other backup at higher rates, they won individual conflicts and rose in rank.

Interestingly, males sometimes participated in the female coalitions against other males, but the scientists note that they never led the charge, so to speak. The formation of female coalitions also seemed to occur after different triggers at different sites. In a site known as Wamba, female bonobos teamed up after males acted aggressively toward mature females. However, in three other communities, coalitions formed in response to male aggression against offspring.

The females in these alliances were often unrelated, and they weren’t necessarily already friends either.

“The degree of group variation in female coalitions and female power between bonobo communities was one of the most fascinating findings from this study,” saysZanna Clay, a primatologist and comparative psychologist at Durham University in the United Kingdom, who was not involved with the study. “This challenges the ‘one-size-fits-all’ view of our closest cousins, and suggests that like us, they show fascinating nuance and important variation in their behavior and traits.”

While no study of animals should be taken as a direct link to the complex factors at play in human society, bonobos and chimpanzees do offer insight into our evolutionary past. “Women are often victims of male violence around the globe,” says Lewis. “This study could provide insight into how women could build power to better protect ourselves from male violence by forming and maintaining coalitions, or alliances, with one another, just like our bonobo cousins.”

Surbeck agreed that there may be lessons for humans here.

“It tells us that male dominance and patriarchy is not evolutionarily inevitable,” he says. “This reinforces the idea that apes and humans are very innovative and flexible in their behavior. If anything, I think we can say that it does give us some hope.”

10,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/shark-octopus-animals-hitchhike-ride-phoresy,"Cockroaches that catch a ride on ants. Grasshoppers that climb aboard sheep. Hitchhiking animals are more common than you think.

Spend enough time in nature, and you will see some weird stuff—fromorcas swimming around wearing salmon like hatstowombats pooping cubes.

But whenRochelle Constantinesaw a nine-foot-long mako shark jet past her research vessel in the Hauraki Gulf off New Zealand with a huge, orange octopus globbed onto its head, she knew she was witnessing something new.

“It was just one of those lucky days,” says Constantine, a marine ecologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.

While sharks and octopuses may seem like animals that live in the same habitat—the ocean—Constantine says that each occupies very different areas. Mako sharks, for instance, are known for spending most of their time in the mid-water, while the New Zealand octopus is a benthic species, living nearly its entire life on the seafloor.

“So it just makes no sense how these two things found each other,” says Constantine.

The researchers observed the duo for about 10 minutes and ultimately decided to nickname them the “sharktopus”. Eventually, the odd couple swam off. Their fate remains unknown.

“We just let them go on their way,” says Constantine.

The octopus-shark duo surprised both scientists andlaypeoplealike, but the behavior of one animal riding another is well known in biology. It’s called phoresy, and it mostly occurs in smaller animals, especially insects and other invertebrates, that can’t disperse as well on their own.

Octopuses aren’t known to practice phoresy, though with all those suckers, they seem especially equipped to do so.

“I guess the things that they might hitchhike on—seals, sea lions, dolphins, and sharks—you know, all of those animals eat octopus,” says Constantine. Animals typically don’t practice phoresy with their natural predators, making sharktopus even more mysterious.

While animals occasionally come into contact with each other through happenstance or accident, phoresy serves a purpose. For example, plenty of creatures rely on hitchhiking to find mates or complete part of their life cycle.

“Dispersal is a key trait and affects things like gene flow and population structure,” saysAndrew Bartlow, an ecologist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. That means that getting from one place to another comes with big stakes for the animal and its ecosystem.

In 2020, Bartlow published areviewstudy of phoresy in the journalBiological Reviews. After scouring the scientific literature, he and his coauthor, Salvatore Agosta, found observations of phoresy in at least 13 phyla, 25 classes, and 60 orders of animals. All of which suggests that hitchhiking behavior has evolved many different times across the tree of life.

Some classic examples include fish known asremoras, which use a fin modified into a sucker to latch onto larger animals, such as whale sharks, and barnacles that can be found securely fastened to the skin of whales or the shells of sea turtles.

(Watch aboldlittlebirdsnatch a remora off oftheworld’slargestfish.)

But there are also cockroaches that ride ants, copepods that ride jellyfish, fairy shrimp that ride trout, water fleas that ride wild boar, millipedes that ride birds, sea anemones that ride crabs, and grasshoppers that ride sheep. Not to mention mites, which make up the vast majority scientific knowledge on phoresy.

“There are so many mites,” says Bartlow.

Catching a lift on a much larger animal has its tradeoffs. Imagine being a pseudoscorpion—a tiny arachnid the size of a pinhead.

Unlike their scorpion cousins, pseudoscorpions lack venomous tails, but they do have similar-looking claws which they sometimes use to cling to larger insects, like the harlequin beetle.

By grabbing hold of these beetles, pseudoscorpions don’t just get a free ride to a new neighborhood—they receive targeted delivery, as the beetles they associate with are freshly transformed adults, who are themselves in search of newly fallen ficus trees, where they lay their eggs.

What’s more, each beetle can carry multiple pseudoscorpions while in flight, which means the morning commute is also a great place for pseudoscorpions to find mates. Males will even do battle with each other on the backs of these beetles, knocking rivals off whenever they get a chance. And once one male has monopolized the ride, he can woo any females aboard and even begin the process of fertilizing their eggs.

But for the pseudoscorpions who get knocked off in flight? They’ll likely be stranded who knows where. The jungles where these animals live are vast, and full of hungry mouths.

“The risks are quite enormous,” says Bartlow.

And the same risks apply to mites riding a migrating bird, or crustaceans known as ostracods riding a frog from bromeliad plant to bromeliad plant—fall off at the wrong time, and you might wind up in a habitat you cannot survive in.

“Using frogs as a mode of transport is beneficial because it allows microorganisms to reach environments where they can survive,” saysAlan Pedro de Araújo, an evolutionary ecologist at State Department of Education in Goiás, Brazil.

“Alternatively, they can bed by wind or rainwater, but these methods are highly random and unreliable,” he says. “Without frogs, the success of their migration would be significantly reduced.

Even with as many examples as Bartlow managed to find, he says there are probably tons more waiting to be discovered. For instance, the ocean seems to be underrepresented in observations of phoresy, likely because it’s much more difficult for scientists to study what happens below the waves.

Scientists are also still trying to understand how phoresy works. For example, in some species, the relationship between the rider and its host can veer towards the macabre.

“Some barnacles are more parasitic than others,” says Bartlow.

Likewise, when freshwater mussel larvae latch onto the gills of the fish who will carry them upstream, the baby mussels also begin to leach nutrients from their hosts, like tiny vampires.

“These things are on a spectrum,” explains Bartlow. But ultimately, scientists suspect phoresy can lead down an evolutionary path toward parasitism.

As for the so-called sharktopus, the jury is still out on exactly how or why the cephalopod might have found its onto the Mako shark’s noggin and whether this example truly counts as phoresy or a chance encounter. Even after a few weeks of media attention and people coming out of the woodwork to offer similar stories on social media, Constantine says they’re no closer to solving the mystery.

“There's been a huge amount of media around us,” says Constantine. “There is not one single explanation for what we've seen.”

11,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/bats-listen-eavesdrop-frog-toad-prey,"The love songs of these Panamanian frogs is a dinner bell for fringe-lipped bats. But how do they learn which frogs and toads are safe to eat and which are poisonous?

During Panama’s wet season, forests boom with a chorus of túngara frog mating calls as males compete for females’ attention.But these calls put the frogs in a precarious position between sex and death. For a fringe-lipped bat, it’s as though its meal is ringing a dinner bell.

Bats navigate the world withecholocation, listening to the sound waves of their own calls bouncing off nearby objects. Their hearing is so precise they can even home in on prey usingripples that frog calls make on water.

But fringe-lipped bats have anadditional auditory superpower. This woolly, wart-mouthed creature listens for frog and toad mating calls and can tell, just from the sound, which are tasty and which are toxic.

Now, scientists have found that adult bats are better at screening out “spam calls” than juveniles. The younger bats often wiggled their ears in response to the calls of poisonous toads, while adults ignored those calls, according to a new study in theProceedings of the Royal Society B.

“That suggests to me that the juveniles have to learn, probably through experience, that those calls are not associated with a good meal,” said Logan James, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at McGill University.

The study is “an excellent reminder that behavior is plastic and shaped by experience, by learning,” said Mirjam Knörnschild, professor of evolutionary ethology at the Humboldt University of Berlin, who was not involved in this study.

Data for the new study originated nearly 17 years ago with Rachel Page, a staff scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama and a senior author on the study. Native to southern Mexico and parts of Central and South America, this is the only bat species known hunt by listening to frog calls.

Page wanted to know if the bats were genetically hard-wired to identify frog calls, or if they learned these calls from experience.

When she was a graduate student, Page and her team collected the calls of 15 different species of frogs and toads—a combination of recordings they and colleagues had gathered at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. They put wild juveniles and adult bats in a cage with a speaker covered with a screen and dead leaves and video recorded the bats’ responses to each call.

In the summer of 2023, some fifteen years after the video data was first collected, James began analyzing the data while serving as a visiting researcher at the Smithsonian’s Panama outpost. James and colleagues found that juveniles and adults, on average, both showed an interest in frogs of a size appropriate to eat.

But unlike adults, some juveniles showed little interest in the calls from frog species that this type of bat often eats, such as the túngara.

And some young bats reacted to poisonous toads by moving their ears, flexing their wings, or flying to the speaker broadcasting the call. One pup even attacked the speaker when it played the call of a poisonous species.

“The fact that these juvenile bats respond so strongly to some of these toad calls really does tell us that they must be changing their strategy over time,” James said.

The new study does not rule out the idea that the mothers of the young bats teach them about frog calls. Anda 2022 studyfound that bats learn navigation from their mothers. There could be a combination of social learning and trial-and-error at play, Page said.

“The mom and pups do associate for long periods of time in the wild, even after weaning. So it seems like lots of opportunity for social learning to take place there,” Page said. “But we also see that they're very, very quick through their own individual experience to acquire new prey quality associations.”

One piece of evidence in favor of the “learning from experience” hypothesis comes from aprevious study from Page’s lab, which trained bats of the same species to fly toward certain ringtones but not others. Scientists showed bats maintained the association with the ringtones for up to four years.

Eavesdropping is an important skill for many animals, including humans. Studying these bats allows researchers to explore a cognitive ability they share with us to listen for cues in nature and make decisions based on what they hear.

Bats learning to pick out the call of a tasty frog from the cacophonous auditory background, and pounce on it, is akin to how we learn the sound of our own names, James said. We perk up when we hear our name mentioned even at a crowded party, and “these bats also learn to selectively attend to important sounds and ignore others,” he said.

To follow up on the new results, James, Page, and others are working on a study exploring how the bats respond to a mixture of calls from different frogs and toads. Page’s lab is additionally researching the bats’ hunting behavior by equipping bats with mini-backpacks carrying tiny microphones and sending them back into the wild.

Long-term, the two researchers plan to explore the extent to which bats may share some

of the fundamental building blocks of human communication, including speech and music.

While Page studies multiple bat species, the fringe-lipped type has fascinated her since her doctoral research on it about two decades ago. “You think, ‘Okay, I think I understand it now,’ and then a whole new suite of questions will unfold.”

12,National Geographic,Animals,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/baby-squid-worm-nannies,"Opalescent baby squid have ""midwives"" to bring them into the world.

An opalescent squid’s experience of motherhood is almost cruelly brief. Towards the end of her life, she engages in a dramatic reproductivespectaclewhere, under the glowing moon, a mating frenzy draws large numbers ofDoryteuthis opalescensinto the shallows to spawn. It’s a relentless, disorienting ritual characterized by clouds of banana-sized cephalopods flashing red arms—a mating signal—and blending together in a haze.

“The seabed and canyon slope, normally a stable point of reference, shifted underneath us as the squid melded in a living current,” says underwater photojournalist Jules Jacobs, who was there to document the story of the mating phenomenon off La Jolla Shores, California, in an eventthat can be witnessed at night, typically once a year, if at all. The mating event itself is unpredictable in terms of when and where it happens, but in general opalescent squid aremost prevalentbetween the Baja Peninsula in Mexico and Monterey Bay, California, though they extend to British Columbia, Canada.

Males, sometimes several of them, mate so aggressively with the inundated mother that they weaken her body. The brutal underwater brawls end in the mother and her mates drifting down to their death, bodies littered among the brood. The mother’s offspring are contained in tubular white capsules that make up vast, luminous underwater fields. They sway gently in the current, clusters of them covering the sandy slope of La Jolla Canyon.

These sheath-like capsules are deposited with up to 300 of her developing squid embryos. The marble-like eggs transform into paralarvae, or baby squid, that look like gelatinous orbs with beady little eyes that crowd together in the sac. The eggs are many layers thick, seeded with bacteria left behind by the mother, which make them generally unpalatable for predators like Dungeness crabs and Bat stars. Other than that line of protection, the squid eggs are on their own in the barren sea floor, waiting to hatch.

In such micro worlds, small invasions are easy to miss. From the depths of the sand emerge the marine wormsCapitella ovincola, who make their way to the eggs. In a move that’s reminiscent of Bruce Lee’s 1-inch punch, the worms make their heads pointy, then flat, as they jab a hole into the egg and wriggle inside.

Though the purpose of the break and enter seems dubious, the worms aren’t here to harm the developing babies.They’re here to act as midwives—that is, to help, says Lou Zeidberg, lecturer at California State University, Monterey Bay, who studies marine biology. While the worms leave the eggs themselves alone, they eat the gelatinous matrix in between each one, called the chorion—a honeycomb-like structure that separates the hundreds of embryos. When they do this, it becomes easier for baby squid to hatch. “Once there are a few punctures in a capsule created by the worms, saltwater seeps in and expands the whole capsule, thus stretching the capsule sheets thinner,” says Zeidberg. Along with better oxygenation, an egg capsulewith worms gets soft and squishy, whereas onewithout them is much more rigid. The paralarvae have an easier time breaking through a softer egg casing where some of the gelatinous matrix material has already been eaten.

The eggs provide nutrients and shelter for the worms, and in turn, the worms facilitate an increased hatch rate for the squid embryos, suggestinga symbiotic relationship between theorganisms. This symbiosis results in approximately17 million extra squidper “run” that could hatch. “Hatching is just the beginning. The life of a baby squid is perilous, and it takes a lot to make it to adulthood,” says Zeidberg. Baby squid have a high mortality rate and deal with a medley of challenges before reaching adulthood, from high predation rates to difficult ocean conditions.

The first to document this symbiosis between the squid and the worms wasOlga Hartman, an American invertebrate zoologist, in 1944. And while some experts like Zeidberg see the worms as midwives now, others have portrayed them more as opportunistic squatters. In a 2002paper,scientists found that after worm activity, the thickness of the gelatinous matrix was reduced, exposing the eggs and causing premature deterioration. When the squid hatched, they had “visible external egg yolk sacs and limited swimming capability, leading to their death shortly after hatching.” In short, the paper argued that worm activity harms the egg sheaths, causing the squid to hatch prematurely and increasing their already precarious mortality rate.

“A lot of symbioses live on a continuum and can slide from being beneficial to harmful once the worm infestation gets high enough,” says Zeidberg. He suggests that differing levels of worm infestation in the squid eggs likely led to the varied interpretation.

Whether the worms serve as midwives or squatters, their presence reflects the broader health of the ocean. “Capitellaworms are well-known to have explosive population growth when there's pollution in the water,” says Greg Rouse, professor of marine biology at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. This worm proliferation could either be a welcome addition to developing paralarvae, helping them hatch, or a tax on their survival, causing them to hatch when they’re still underdeveloped. The Capitella worms are often called pollution indicators, proliferating when there are too many nutrients in the water. Their bright red coloring is because of hemoglobin, allowing them to tolerate the low oxygen levels.

The underwater world is filled with these hidden symbioses, and however scientists interpret the role ofCapitella ovincola, one thing is clear: The mother squid’s brood is not alone after her death. Tiny worms are there, ushering them into the world.

13,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/deforestation,"Large scale destruction of trees—deforestation—affects ecosystems, climate, and even increases risk for zoonotic diseases spreading to humans.

As the world seeks to slow the pace ofclimate change, preserve wildlife, and supportmore than eight billion people, trees inevitably hold a major part of the answer. Yet the mass destruction of trees—deforestation—continues, sacrificing the long-term benefits of standing trees for short-term gain of fuel, and materials for manufacturing and construction.

We need trees for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that they absorb the carbon dioxide we exhale and the heat-trappinggreenhouse gasesthat human activities emit. As those gases enter the atmosphere,global warmingincreases, a trend scientists now prefer to call climate change.

There is also the imminent danger of disease caused by deforestation. An estimated60 percent of emerging infectious diseasescome from animals, and a major cause of viruses’ jump from wildlife to humans is habitat loss, often through deforestation.

But we can still save our forests. Aggressive efforts to rewild and reforest are already showing success. Tropical tree cover alone can provide 23 percent of the climate mitigation needed to meet goalsset in the Paris Agreementin 2015,according to one estimate.

Forests still coverabout 30 percentof the world’s land area, but they are disappearing at an alarming rate. Since 1990, the world has lost more than 420 million hectares or about a billion acres of forest,according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations—mainly in Africa and South America. About17 percentof the Amazonian rainforest has been destroyed over the past 50 years, and losses recently havebeen on the rise. The organization Amazon Conservation reports thatdestruction rose by 21 percent in 2020, a loss the size of Israel.

Farming, grazing of livestock, mining, and drilling combined account formore than half of all deforestation. Forestry practices, wildfires and, in small part, urbanization account for the rest. In Malaysia and Indonesia, forests are cut down to make way for producingpalm oil, which can be found ineverything from shampoo to saltinecrackers. In the Amazon, cattle ranching and farms—particularly soy plantations—arekey culprits.

Logging operations, which provide the world’s wood and paper products, also fell countless trees each year. Loggers, some of themacting illegally, also build roads to access more and more remote forests—which leads to further deforestation. Forests are also cut as a result of growing urban sprawl as land is developed for homes.

Not all deforestation is intentional. Some is caused by a combination of human and natural factors likewildfiresand overgrazing, which may prevent the growth of young trees.

There are some250 million people who live in forest and savannah areasand depend on them for subsistence and income—many of them among the world’s rural poor.

Eighty percent of Earth’sland animals and plants live in forests, and deforestation threatens species including theorangutan,Sumatran tiger, and many species of birds. Removing trees deprives the forest of portions of its canopy, which blocks the sun’s rays during the day and retains heat at night. That disruption leads to more extreme temperature swings that can be harmful to plants and animals.

With wild habitats destroyed and human life ever expanding, the line between animal and human areas blurs, opening the door tozoonotic diseases. In 2014, for example, the Ebola virus killed over 11,000 people in West Africa afterfruit bats transmitted the disease to a toddlerwho was playing near trees where bats were roosting.

(How deforestation is leading to more infectious diseases in humans.)

Some scientists believe there could be as many as 1.7 million currently “undiscovered” viruses in mammals and birds, of which up to 827,000 could have the ability to infect people, according toa 2018 study.

Deforestation’s effects reach far beyond the people and animals where trees are cut. The South American rainforest, for example, influences regional and perhaps even global water cycles, and it's key to the water supply in Brazilian cities and neighboring countries. The Amazon actually helps furnish water to some of the soy farmers and beef ranchers who are clearing the forest. The loss of clean water and biodiversity from all forests could have many other effects we can’t foresee,touching even your morning cup of coffee.

In terms of climate change, cutting trees both adds carbon dioxide to the air and removes the ability to absorb existing carbon dioxide. If tropical deforestation were a country, according to theWorld Resources Institute, it would rank third in carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions, behind China and the U.S.

The numbers are grim, but many conservationists see reasons for hope. A movement is under way to preserve existing forest ecosystems and restore lost tree cover by first reforesting (replanting trees) and ultimately rewilding (a more comprehensive mission to restore entire ecosystems).

(Which nation could be the first to be rewilded?)

Organizations and activists are working to fight illegal mining and logging—National Geographic Explorer Topher White, for example, has come up with a way to userecycled cell phones to monitor for chainsaws. In Tanzania, the residents of Kokota haveplanted more than 2 million treeson their small island over a decade, aiming to repair previous damage. And in Brazil,conservationists are rallyingin the face ofominous signalsthat the government may roll back forest protections.

(Which tree planting projects should you support?)

Stopping deforestation before it reaches a critical point will play a key role in avoiding the next zoonotic pandemic.A November 2022 studyshowed that when bats struggle to find suitable habitat, they travel closer to human communities where diseases are more likely to spillover. Inversely, when bats’ native habitats were left intact, they stayed away from humans. This research is the first to show how we can predict and avoid spillovers through monitoring and maintaining wildlife habitats.

For consumers, it makes sense to examine the products and meats you buy, looking for sustainably produced sources when you can. Nonprofit groups such as theForest Stewardship Counciland theRainforest Alliancecertify products they consider sustainable, while theWorld Wildlife Fund has a palm oil scorecardfor consumer brands.

14,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/milky-seas-database-bioluminescence-ocean-history,"""Milky seas” are one of the rarest reported forms of bioluminescence. A new scientific database may finally reveal the secrets of this ghostly phenomenon.

“It looked as if we were sailing over a boundless plain of snow, or a sea of quicksilver,” writes Captain Kempthorne in his ship’s log.

Sailing a ship calledMoozufferthrough the Arabian Sea in January 1849, he witnessed something so rare that there are under 400 known records in 400 years and just one photo.

This ghostly phenomenon, called milky seas, has puzzled sailors and scientists for centuries.

After delving into centuries of ship logs like Kempthorne's, eyewitness accounts, newspapers, and satellite imagery, Justin Hudson, PhD candidate at Colorado State University (CSU) and Steven Miller, an atmospheric scientist also at CSU, have published the world's largest database of milky sea observationsin the journalEarth and Space Science.

In it, they write that “throughout history, this topic has teetered on the edge between myth and scientific knowledge.”

But now their database could help to illuminate the centuries-long mystery.

Milky seas are a rare form of bioluminescence: the light they emit is thought to come from bacteria.

Witnesses have described them as “the most fantastical thing they’ve ever observed,” Hudson says. They recall night-time seas turning to “thick milk or cream” and glowing “as though green neon lights were alight just under the surface of the sea.”

According to these eyewitness accounts, it can cause the whole surface of the ocean to shine for months at a time, bright enough to be seen from space. In daylight or moonlight, it vanishes.

In the novel20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Jules Verne suggests this “lactified” ocean is caused by a “diminutive glowworm that's colorless and gelatinous in appearance, as thick as a strand of hair, and no longer than one-fifth of a millimeter.”

A research vessel that happened upon this phenomenon in1985 collected water samplesthat contained a bacteria calledVibrio harveyi,which they hypothesized might be the source of the glow.

Like other bacterial bioluminescence, milky seas have a steady, even gleam “like the glow-in-the-dark plastic stars you can buy your kids,” according to a 1980 U.S. Navy sighting.

Accounts indicate that this glow is different from the transient sparkles that occur when plankton create bioluminescence, but the two can happen together.

Sailors in 1974 noted that “bright speckles of marine bioluminescence continued to appear in the water” as they sailed through a milky sea.

Among those who witness milky seas, they tend to report the ocean as appearing strangely calm. One captain describes how the unbroken waters “seemed so dense and solid” that his ship looked like “she was forcing her way through molten lead.”

This might be an optical illusion, or there could be some truth in it.

The research vessel that sampled a milky sea in 1985 found bioluminescent bacteria and a type of algae that “emits this mucus that calms the ocean’s surface,” Hudson says. This could account for the eerily flat seas.

People without scientific training “capture the information completely differently,” saysAbigail McQuatters-Gollopa plankton ecologist at University of Plymouth in England, who wasn’t involved in the study. “They never thought it would be used for any ecological study.”

Some descriptions found in old documents are too matter-of-fact and vague to know if they’re useful. Does ‘white water’ indicate a milky sea or rough currents?

“I think they did the best job they could do with the kind of data they had available…400 samples over 400 years is really not that much,” says McQuatters-Gollop. “But I was just intrigued by the whole thing.”

Hudsonspent around nine months combing through records. Although the descriptions were taken by mariners, this qualitative data is valuable for scientists like the team at CSU. They can pinpoint times and locations that allow scientists to know where to look for more clues.

Their rarity makes studying these events almost impossible. Scientists can’t “have a boat permanently sit out there and hope and pray and wait,” Hudson says.

Theonly known photographwas taken by a private yacht sailing just south of Indonesia in 2019. The crew only realized what they’d seen after reading Miller’s2021Scientific Reportspaper.

“There's so much luck involved in witnessing this,” McQuatters-Gollop says.

These events can span enormous distances, scientists have found.

“Milky seas can exceed [over 38,000 square miles],” Hudson says—that’s larger than the state ofIndiana—“and last for up to months at a time.”

The new database suggests they typically cover around 3,800 square miles, although the data might be skewed because larger milky seas are more noticeable for both satellites and humans. “The bigger the event, the more likely [people] are to sail to it,” he says.

This new database shows that milky seas occur primarily in the NorthwestIndian Oceanand in the Maritime Continent—a tropical region between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

The study authors also learned that globalclimate patternsmay play a role in their formation.

In summer, “following aLa Niñathere are more milky sea events than expected,” Hudson says. In winter, more occur at the peak of the positive Indian Ocean Dipole—when the alternating temperatures on either side of the Indian Ocean are warmer in the west.

They may be linked to strongermonsoons. These can causeupwellings, which bring nutrient-rich waters up from the deep, resulting in “an explosion” in the food chain, he says.

By revealing patterns among the complex interactions between these phenomena, this database could help researchers predict and even sample milky seas.

For now, milky seas remain enigmatic. “We don't even know enough about them to know how important they are,” Hudson says.

Glimpsing the ghostly spectacle more often might even indicate poor ocean health.“The bacteria we suspect is causing milky seas is a known pest species that can kill off fish,” Hudson says.

If this is the case, fisheries and economies around the world could suffer if these events increase. Says Hudson: “The ocean is giving a very visible warning sign.”

15,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/tornado-extreme-weather-climate-change,"Unlike heat waves and floods, research on climate change and tornadoes is still in its infancy.

Natural disasters likeheat waves,fires, and floodsare growing more dangerous because of climate change, but the effect a warming world has on tornadoes is complicated and inconclusive.

There’s been a recorded increase in the overall number of observed tornadoes since 1950, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationdata, but experts say that’s largely a result of better technology such as Doppler radar. There’s been no observed increase in the frequency of major tornadoes over time.

But given the pervasive influence of global warming on the atmosphere, it's unavoidable that climate change would impact tornadoes too, said Victor Gensini, an extreme weather expert at Northern Illinois University.

“Instead of asking: ‘Did climate change cause this tornado?’ It’s better to operate under the assumption that climate change did play a role,” he said. “Start from the premise that every extreme event is being affected by climate change.”

To understand how climate change could impact tornadoes, it helps to understand how warm, humid air flowing beneath cool, dry air creates the unstable atmospheric conditions in which they form.

As warm air rises into cooler air, wind shear—a sudden change in the wind’s speed or direction—can spin this upward-moving air like a top, creating a tornado.

(Learn more about tornadoes.)

As the climate warms, it’s heating the atmosphere and creating more energy to power tornadoes.Recently, millions of Americans in the midwest and south were exposed to major tornado outbreaks that killed several people and destroyed homes.

How climate change will alter the winds that bring tornadoes to life is still unclear.

Warmer conditions actually may be diminishing the wind shear that spins up tornadoes; theArctic is warming more quicklythan lower latitudes, which may be weakening the strength of jet stream winds and the resulting wind shear.

“It’s anybody's guess how that’s going to play out,” Jeff Masters, a meteorologist at Yale Climate Connections toldNational Geographicin 2021.

When conditions are ripe for a tornado, however, more heat will mean “you can have bigger outbreaks because there’s more energy” stored up, Master said. That means more tornadoes could spin out of storms. Onestudypublished in 2016 found that, since 1954, single storms were producing more tornadoes.

Research on tornadoes is challenging because small tornadoes have been historically more difficult to observe, making it challenging to conclusively say how they have changed.

Onestudy published in 2024, on which Gensini was an author, looked at supercells, a type of major, rotating storm cell known for producing hail and deadly tornadoes. It ran models that suggest supercells will increase in the east and decrease across the Great Plains. It also found that these storms will become more common in late winter and early spring, outside of the traditional storm season window.

Onestudypublished in 2018 looked at tornado observations since 1979 and observed a shift in tornado locations, from slightly west of the Mississippi River to east of the river, in more populated states like Kentucky and Arkansas.

“We think it might be climate change. But it might also be natural variability,” said Gensini, an author on the study. “We stepped on the scale, and we know we gained 15 pounds, but we don’t know if it’s poor diet or lack of exercise.”

However even a slight geographic shift could have major consequences if storms become more common in more densely populated parts of the country. A tornado striking a cornfield is less dangerous than one tearing through a subdivision.

“The scary part of this is, in the Southeast [there are] an increasing number of manufactured homes,” said Stephen Strader, a geographer studying extreme weather risk at Villanova University. “The odds are stacked against us [there].”

Overall, Americans have made great progress in protecting ourselves against tornadoes: When population increase is taken into account,the tornado fatality rate has declined dramaticallyover the past century, in large part because of improved weather forecasting and warning systems.

But how we build our communities has a major impact on how much death and destruction they cause in future.

Strader noted one simple solution: “We could save countless lives if we improved how mobile homes are anchored to the ground.”

16,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/wildfires,"In the past two decades, the number of Americans at risk of experiencing a wildfire has doubled. Learn what you need to do if one is near you.

Multiple large wildfires burning around Los Angeles have tens of thousands of residents evacuating as the fires show no sign of slowing their spread.

The spark that caused the fires isunder investigation, but the risk of wildfires developing has been extremely high in Southern California. January is typically the rainy season in Los Angeles, but this winter, rainfall has been scarce. These dry, flammable conditions were already extremely dangerous when the region's seasonal Santa Anna winds created 100 mph gusts in some areas.

These warm, dry winds spread the embers that spark new flames and can make it more difficult for firefighters to contain fires.

Wildfires can burn millions of acres of land at shockingly fast speeds, consuming everything in their paths. These rolling flames travel up to 14 miles an hour, which converts to about a four-minute-mile pace, and can overtake the average human in minutes.

Destruction caused by wildfires in the United States has significantly increased in the last two decades. An average of72,400 wildfires cleared an average of 7 million acresof U.S. land each year since 2000,double the number of acresscorched by wildfires in the 1990s. In 2020, California had itslargest wildfire season in historyafter more than 10,000 fires burned through over 4 million acres.

Because much of the U.S. is expected to get hotter and drier with climate change, wildfire risk isgenerally expected to rise. At the same time, as the population in the United States rises and people increasingly move into rural and wilderness areas, more homes and other structures are likely to be placed in harm’s way.

That’s why it’s critical to understand how wildfires get started, how to stop them, and what to do when they occur.

Though they are classified by the Environmental Protection Agency asnatural disasters, only 10 to 15 percent of wildfires occur on their own in nature. The other85 to 90 percent result from human causes, including unattended camp and debris fires, discarded cigarettes, and arson.

Naturally occurring wildfires can spark during dry weather and droughts. In these conditions, normally green vegetation becomes bone-dry, flammable fuel; strong winds spread fire quickly; and warm temperatures encourage combustion. With these ingredients, the only thing missing is a spark—in the form oflightning, arson, a downed power line, or a burning campfire or cigarette—to wreak havoc.

Natural or man-made, three conditions must be present for a wildfire to burn: fuel, oxygen, and a heat source. Firefighters call these three elements the fire triangle.

Fuelis any flammable material surrounding a fire, including trees, grasses, brush, even homes. The greater an area's fuel load, the more intense the fire is likely to be. The most wildfire-prone state is California, whichlost 2,569,386 acresof land to 7,396 wildfires in 2021.

Airsupplies the oxygen a fire needs to burn. California wildfires are often made worse by the hot, drySanta Ana winds, which can carry a spark for miles. In Hawaii, Hurricane Dorian's winds helped feed the flames that burned through Maui in 2023.

Heat sourceshelp spark the wildfire and bring fuel to temperatures hot enough to ignite. Lightning, burning campfires or cigarettes, and even the sun can all provide sufficient heat to spark a wildfire.

Violent infernos are most common in the western states, where heat, drought, and frequent thunderstorms create ripe conditions. Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, Colorado, Oregon, and California experience some of the worst conflagrations. Wildfires also occur around the world and in most of the 50 states.

Firefighters battle blazes by depriving them of one or more of the fire triangle fundamentals. One traditional method is to douse existing fires with water and spray fire retardants. Firefighters also sometimes work in teams, often calledhotshots, to clear vegetation from the land around a fire to contain and eventually starve it of fuel. The resulting tracts of land are calledfirebreaks.

Firefighters may also employ controlled burning, creatingbackfires, to stop a wildfire. This method involves fighting fire with fire. These prescribed—and controlled—fires remove undergrowth, brush, and litter from a forest, depriving an otherwise raging wildfire of fuel.

While wildfires are a natural part of many ecosystems, climate change has created conditions that make fires larger, more likely to occur, and a year round threat.

Californiahas gotten about 3 degrees Fahrenheit hotter since humans began producing greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels. All this persistent heat and too little rainfall sucks moisture out of the ground, creating drier, more flammable vegetation.

(Learn more about the connection between climate change and wildfire.)

Although they can be dangerous to humans, naturally occurring wildfiresplay an integral role in nature. By burning dead or decaying matter, they can return otherwise trapped nutrients to the soil. They also act as a disinfectant, removing disease-ridden plants and harmful insects from an ecosystem.

Wildfires thin forest canopies and undergrowth, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor and a new generation of seedlings to grow. In fact, some species of trees,like sequoias, rely on fire for their seeds to even open.

In Hawaii, however, invasive grasses not native to the state may have worsened Maui's fires. This flammable grass now covers about a quarter of Hawaii's total land area, and the average area burned by wildfires has grown 400 percent in the past 100 years, according to theHawaii Wildfire Management Organization.

Wildfires devastate anything in their path. And while they are difficult to stop, there are many steps people can take before, during, and after wildfires to limit their damage.

17,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/global-warming-effects,"A warmer planet doesn’t just raise temperatures. From wildfires to floods, here's how the climate is changing.

Since the Industrial Revolution—an event made possible by the use of fossil fuels in everything from power plants to transportation—Earth has gotten hotter.

2024 was the hottest year on record and the first year Earth's temperature surpassed 1.5°C (2.7°F).

Thepast 10 years have been the 10 hottest yearson record, and areconstruction of Earth's average temperatureover the past 485 million years showed that when the planet warms, catastrophic weather and mass extinctions follow. At no point in the period of Earth's history examined, the study notes, have temperatures warmed as quickly as they're warming now.

Global warming andclimate changeare often used interchangeably as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems.

Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also natural disasters, shifting wildlife habitats,rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trappinggreenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide and methane, to the atmosphere.

When fossil fuel emissions are pumped into the atmosphere, they change the chemistry of our atmosphere, allowing sunlight to reach the Earth but preventing heat from being released into space. This keeps Earth warm, like a greenhouse, and this warming is known as thegreenhouse effect.

Carbon dioxide is the most commonly found greenhouse gas anda majorityof all the climate warming pollution in the atmosphere. This gas is a byproduct of producing and burning oil, gas, and coal. About a quarter of carbon dioxide also results from land cleared for timber or agriculture.

Methane is another common greenhouse gas. Although it makes up only about 16 percent of emissions, it's roughly 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide and dissipates more quickly. That means methane can cause a large spark in warming, but ending methane pollution can also quickly limit the amount of atmospheric warming. Sources of this gas include agriculture (mostly livestock), leaks from oil and gas production, and waste from landfills.

One of the most concerning impacts of global warming is the effect warmer temperatures will have on Earth's polar regions and mountain glaciers. The Arctic is warmingfour times fasterthan the rest of the planet. This warming reduces critical ice habitat and it disrupts the flow of the jet stream, creating more unpredictable weather patterns around the globe.

(Learn more about the jet stream.)

A warmer planet doesn't just raise temperatures.Precipitation is becoming more extremeas the planet heats. For every degree your thermometer rises, the air holds about seven percent more moisture. This increase in moisture in the atmosphere can produce flash floods, more destructive hurricanes, and even paradoxically, stronger snow storms.

The world's leading scientists regularly gather to review the latest research on how the planet is changing. The results of this review is synthesized in regularly published reports known as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.

Acomprehensive report outlineshow disruptive a global rise in temperature can be:





Limiting the rising in global warming is theoretically achievable, but politically, socially, and economically difficult.

Those same sources of greenhouse gas emissions must be limited to reduce warming. For example, oil and gas used to generate electricity or power industrial manufacturing will need to be replaced by net zero emission technology like wind and solar power. Transportation, another major source of emissions, will need to integrate more electric vehicles, public transportation, and innovative urban design, such as safe bike lanes and walkable cities.

(Learn more about solutions to limit global warming.)

One global warming solution that was once considered far fetched is now being taken more seriously: geoengineering. This type of technology relies on manipulating the Earth's atmosphere to physically block the warming rays of the sun or by sucking carbon dioxide straight out of the sky.

Restoring nature may also help limit warming. Trees, oceans, wetlands, and other ecosystems help absorb excess carbon—but when they're lost, so too is their potential to fight climate change.

Ultimately, we'll need to adapt to warming temperatures, building homes to withstand sea level rise for example, or more efficiently cooling homes during heat waves.

18,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/white-lotus-poison-fruit-cerbera-odollam,"The pong pong tree—also known as the “suicide tree”—may be a plot point in the season finale of the HBO series. But the plant was known to cause thousands of deaths a year in the past.

Forbidden fruit has been a theme across all seasons ofThe White Lotus, HBO’s series about a fictional high-end hotel chain. In season three, set in Thailand, the metaphor becomes literal when a hotel worker warns a guest not to eat the fruit of the pong pong tree, as it is toxic enough to kill.

Fans of the showare now chatteringabout whether that deadly narrative seed, planted in the season premiere, will bear fruit in the 90-minute finale as the character Timothy Ratliff’s suicidal ideations continue to escalate.

(Inspired by White Lotus? Here are the Thai islands to visit.)

But what fans might not know is that the pong pong tree (Cerbera odollam) is a real poisonous plant that has been implicated in thousands of deaths a year in the past. The effects of its deadly fruit are so notorious in Southeast Asia that it has earned the morbid nickname “the suicide tree.”

The pong pong tree is part of the dogbane family, a branch of flowering plants famous for producing poisons. Its rangeincludesSoutheast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia, though it has been introduced to environments around the world as an ornamental tree.

The active poison in the plant, cerberin, ismost concentratedin the seeds (or kernels) of the fruit, which are roughly the size of peach stones.A very small dose can be fatal, though some people have recovered from poisonings.

(Death cap mushrooms are extremely deadly—and they're spreading.)

“Like with any poison, it depends on the person—their age, their sex, their size, and whether they've got any existing illnesses.”says Hilary Hamnett, an associate professor in forensic science at the University of Lincoln and author ofPoisonous Tales: A Forensic Examination of Poisons in Fiction.

The chemical gives the seeds an off-putting bitter taste, which is the point, from the tree’s perspective.

“Plants evolve to make these very bitter chemicals because what you don't want, as a plant, is for somebody to come and eat your kernel, so you're not going to be able to reproduce and grow again,” Hamnett says.

(The 5,000-Year Secret History of the Watermelon)

“Animals come and eat it once, and the taste puts them off eating anymore,” she adds. “It's a defense mechanism.”

But humans are a different story. Over the centuries, humans have learned to grind the seeds of pong pong trees, and its poisonous plant relatives, down into a powder and ingest them orally a wide variety of reasons—including as medicine, as a means of homicide or suicide, andeven as an ordealin witch trails.

In addition to tasting bad, cerberin is a cardiac glycoside, meaning that it attacks the heart.

Like other ingested poisons, cerberin is absorbed into the bloodstream from the stomach. Theonset of symptomscan occur within about 20 to 30 minutes, as the body's defense system prompts nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to flush the poison from the system.

(Here’s why poisonous animals don’t poison themselves.)

Within an hour of ingestion, cerberin can dangerously lower a person’s heart rate by disrupting the sodium-potassium pump that regulates cardiac movements, according to Hamnett. A person suffering from poisoning might experience palpitations and dysrhythmias that escalate to heart failure.

“It will basically override the polarization within the body that's required for the heart muscle to contract and relax,” says Owen McDougal, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at Boise State University. “Without the impulse and relaxation phases, the heart muscle just stops working.”

“It's not a desirable way to go,” he adds.

Pong pong trees have been notorious for centuries as agents of death. A studypublished in 2004implicated the tree in about half of the plant poisoning cases—and a tenth of total poisoning cases—in Kerala, India from 1989 to 1999.

The same study estimated that some 3,000 people a year may have perished in past centuries from pong pong trees and their close relative, the sea mango (Cerbera manghas), previously known as tangena. The latter plant was used as an “ordeal poison” during 19th century witch trials in Madagascar.

“A person suspected of spiritual subversion, and sometimes even of theft or other mundane offences, had to drink a solution of tangena shavings in water, followed by pieces of chicken-skin,” according to a journal articleon the practicepublished in 2002. “Vomiting the latter was taken as a sign of innocence. Some people thus tested died from the effects of the poison. Others failed to vomit the chicken-skin, in which case they were considered guilty and liable to be executed.”

The plant has claimed so many victims partly because it is often consumed in remote rural areas with no access to emergency treatment. But the reach of the poison is increasingly global as online retailers sell the trees and seeds worldwide.

For instance, a 2018 study presented six cases ofpong pong treepoisoning in the United States, three of which were fatal. One of those deaths involved a 33-year-old woman who purchased the poison, advertised as a weight-loss supplement, over the internet.

McDougal has also encountered the reverse scenario. In 2022, he reporteda case studyinvolving a man who had attempted suicide with pong pong seeds, but then recovered after ingestion.

There is no cure-all antidote to pong pong poison, even for patients who receive timely medical attention. Doctors might administer poisons with opposite effects, such as atropine, along with efforts at cardiac resuscitation. But the prognosis for patients depends on a variety of factors.

“Assuming that the person doesn't receive any treatment at all, death can come within an hour,” says Hamnett. “When people who've taken things like this go to hospital, typically their heart rate might be at 30 beats a minute, so it's dropping incredibly fast until the point where it just stops altogether.”

Whether or not the pong pong tree claims a fictional victim inThe White Lotus, it has a frightening death toll in the real world. As the plant’s macabre reputation spreads, and as exotic ornamentals go global, the toxic tree could lead to more tragedies. While the forbidden fruit may be tempting, some things are meant to be left untouched.

19,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/benefits-of-apartment-composting,"Lack of outdoor space shouldn’t stop you from composting. Here’s how to get started.

Composting is the simplest way to turn your trash into treasure. Not only can it help reduce the world’s carbon footprint, but the fertilizer that results from the process can also make food more nutritious.

When it comes to composting tips, though, most are typically geared towards those living in homes with access to outdoor space. But fear not, apartment dwellers. Below, environment and sustainability experts offer their suggestions for making composting work for you—without any smelly buckets of decaying food waste sitting on your kitchen counter.

Composting is essentially ""nature’s way of recycling,"" according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It involves microorganisms breaking down organic material, including food scraps, into fertilizer, creating a new use for these materials and keeping them out of landfills.

""When added to soil, compost enhances soil tilth and fertility, suppresses plant disease, improves the ability of soil to retain nutrients, helps soil retain water, and improves soil structure,"" saysBrenda Platt, director of the composting for community initiative at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.

Many people who compost on their own use the resulting soil enhancer to grow their own produce. That unique, natural fertilizer contains nutrients that can't be found in other kinds of fertilizer, according to Sophie Jones, a sustainability project associate at George Washington University's Office of Sustainability. A2023 study published inISME Communicationssuggests that using compost when growing produce can result in more nutritious crops than ones grown without compost.

(How to compost at home—a guide for beginners.)

However, those dropping off compost at community bins likely aren’t growing their own food, so they may not see the benefit. But Jones notes that composting equals less waste in your trash can, which means fewer odors and visits to your building's trash chute. On a much larger scale, Platt highlights that keeping food waste out of landfills can have positive global implications—and can even make your next farmers market purchase even healthier.

Unlike when composted, food waste that decomposes in landfills breaks down without oxygen. This leads to the production of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, in turn raising the earth’s temperature at a much faster rate than carbon dioxide and contributing to climate change.A 2023 report from the EPA, which studied U.S. landfill methane emissions from 1990 to 2020, found that food waste from landfills released anestimated 58 percent of methane emissions into the atmosphere.

(Carbon dioxide levels are at a record high. Here's what you need to know.)

The first step in composting is collecting the organic matter that amasses at home—this can be everythingfrom apple cores and moldy bread to hair that you shed during a shower, Jones notes.

Non-compostable items sometimes depend on where you're composting. For example,the EPA notesthat using meat or animal bones when composting in your backyard can attract rodents, but many local pick-up or drop-off composting services allow them. Regardless of where you're composting, you shouldn't include human or animal waste, diseased plants, or colored or glossy paper, according to theNational Resources Defense Council.

When it comes to storing compost, there’s no need to spend much, or anything, to do so at home. Simply take any large plastic bag or food storage container, fill it with your food scraps, and stick it in the freezer. Freezing the scraps will prevent them from decomposing or smelling.

""Just keeping my compost in a bag in the freezer, it keeps everything in an easy clump,” says Jones. “It doesn't smell [and] it's easy to transport to compost bins.""

Some farmers markets offering composting services may also give out free composting bins. You can purchase your own bin, but some come with high price tags—Jones spent about $50 on one that sits on her kitchen counter and features a charcoal filter to reduce odor. There are also uber-deluxe versions, typically costing a few hundred dollars, that actually mimic the natural composting process.

Once your compost bin is full, take your collection to a local organization that will compost it themselves. Many cities offer drop-off locations for composting; some are stationary bins with 24/7 access, while others can be found at local farmers markets. Community gardens may be interested in food scraps as well. Certain grocery store chains have compost bins at their entrances, and there are also some companies and waste management organizations that come directly to you to pick up compost scraps for a fee.

If your area doesn't currently offer composting, that doesn't mean it's the end of the road. Platt suggests reaching out to your local government officials about implementing a local composting program, or connecting with neighbors to plan a communal area where everyone can compost together.

""Community composting can build critical support for and participation in future citywide food scrap recovery programs,"" Platt says. In other words, local composting begets more local initiatives that make composting easier.

Platt and Jones agree that the power of local communities doing their small parts can have a major impact on the state of the world at large.

""Composting actually turns waste into valuable resources,"" Jones says. ""I just really enjoy the fact that it takes a toll off of our land waste and actually puts it back into the economy and the earth in a positive way.""

20,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/thriving-marine-ecosystem-found-antarctic-iceberg,"A hidden ecosystem of giant sea spiders, octopuses, and other stunning sea creatures shows how life can flourish even when sealed off from the surface by a thick layer of ice.

On January 13, when an iceberg the size of Chicago broke away from Antarctica’s immense George VI Ice Shelf, scientists in a nearby research vessel did something nobody had ever done. They sailed to look at the seafloor that had suddenly been exposed, like lifting the world’s biggest rock to see what critters lay underneath.

Life is almost everywhere in the oceans, from the sunlit-bathed shallows to the pitch-black, sometimesvolcanic depths. The research team aboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute’s R/VFalkor (too)ship were confident they’d find animals at their destination. But they were shocked at theexplosion of lifethey discovered—a forest of sponges, giant sea spiders, icefish, octopuses, huge corals, anemones, and ethereal deep-sea jellyfish.

Marine biology is known to be highly adaptive and extremely resilient. “It’s not an absolute surprise that we have life,” saysSasha Montelli, a geophysicist and glaciologist at University College London and expedition team member. But “biologists were really surprised by the richness of it—how colorful, how spectacular it was.”

“That tells us that what we have are thriving, diverse, and well-established ecosystems under the ice shelf,” saysPatricia Esquete, a marine ecologist at the University of Aveiro, Portugal and member of the expedition. And that diversity offers scientists a puzzle.

Normally, deep-sea ecosystems get their nutrients from the sea surface, which sprinkle down toward the seafloor. But this area was covered by a 500-foot-thick icy roof for an interminable amount of time, meaning that these critters must be getting their nutrients another way.

“What mechanisms allow these ecosystems to occur and thrive?” says Esquete. The expedition team hopes that the huge volume of oceanic and environmental data taken during from the site will provide some concrete answers—as well as revealing if any of these animals they’ve found are previously unknown to science.

“It’s going to be really exciting to see what they find,” saysJon Copley, a deep-sea ecologist at the University of Southampton who was not involved with the expedition.

R/VFalkor (too)has travelled across the world in the hope of solving all kinds of marine mysteries. And in January, it just so happened to be exploring the frigid waters around Antarctica. Ecologists were seeking out curious forms of life, while physical oceanographers and geoscientistswere studying the Southern Ocean, amajor sinkfor carbon dioxide emissions.

While sailing in the Bellingshausen Sea they looked at their satellite imagery of the area, which is updated on a near-daily basis. “We saw that right next door, there was this huge iceberg calving,” says Montelli. A-84, as the iceberg was later dubbed, broke away from the Antarctic Peninsula, before quickly drifting away.

Ice shelves, and their underbellies, are notoriously difficult to study. Conveniently, A-84 unveiled a 209-square-mile patch of seafloor for all to see.

“We decided right away to change the sampling plan and head to the area that was recently covered by ice,” saysLaura Cimoli, a physical oceanographer at the University of Cambridge who led the oceanographic effort on the expedition.

When the ship arrived, they wasted no time in deploying their surveillance tech, from their remotely operated submersible,SuBastian, to autonomous robots that gathered information about the properties of the water column.

Immediately, it was clear that there was considerably more life there than anyone anticipated. “There were many species, occupying a variety of ecological niches and with a variety of functional traits,” says Esquete.

To determine how long the ecosystem had existed, they turned to sea sponges. These animals often grow very slowly, around just an inch or so per year. But the sponges in this abyss were so large that they must have been growing there for many decades or even centuries.

The discovery of this life isn’t surprising in isolation.

“Many animals thrive in dark, cold-water habitats, so it makes sense that this community was established under the shelf, which not only concealed the community, but also provided it with protection from surface activities and exploitation,” saysDanielle DeLeo, a deep-sea biologist at Florida International University who was not involved with the expedition.

But it’s odd to see such a plurality of different lifeforms in what was, until very recently, a confined environment. In fact, “it looks similar to the seabed life that we get in Antarctica that aren’t covered by ice,” says Copley—but how is this possible?

When they’re satiated, the krill sink far below the waves and bring nutrients to the seafloor with them—includingvia their poop, which fertilizes and feeds the denizens of the depths.

That doesn’t really happen when you have a ginormous ice cap suspended above the seafloor. This would prevent phytoplankton blooms, which would in turn stop the downward precipitation of nutrients.

“Weexpected that,given these ecosystems could not be fed by photosynthesis happening on the surface, the ecosystem would be more impoverished and less established,” says Esquete.

The rich ecosystem they found suggests that “any food that came in would have been carried on currents, slipping in underneath the ice shelf,” says Copley. That tracks, as oceanographers have mapped out submarine rivers flowing both to and from this part of Antarctica.

“The fact that we found long-living species suggests that indeed the lateral transport, which mostly consists of glacial meltwater from George VI ice shelf, could be the source of the nutrients sustaining the thriving life found under the newly exposed ice shelf,” says Cimoli.

With so many biological, geological and chemical samples yet to be processed, many questions remain. Esquete wonders how the ecosystem will develop now that their icy roof has vanished.

Cimoli is curious about how the iceberg’s formation has churned up the upper ocean and introduced turbulence to its distinct layers. She also wonders howthis iceberg’s liberation has affected the region’s oceanic circulation.

Ecologists, meanwhile, are grappling with just how quickly their knowledge of the Antarctic depths has evolved.

Thanks to A-84, they now have “a glimpse as to how far the very rich seabed life we have around Antarctica extends beneath the floating ice shelf,” says Copley.

21,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/earthquakes,"Thousands of temblors occur every day. Here’s what you need to know about where they usually take place and how they're measured.

Earthquakes, also called temblors, can be so tremendously destructive that it’s hard to imagine theyoccur by the thousandsevery day around the world, usually in the form of small tremors. Most are so small that humans can't feel them.

But even smaller quakes can cause a stir—most recently an earthquake near York Harbor, Maine, with a preliminary magnitude of 3.8 on January 27, 2025.

In the United States, East Coast earthquakeshappen less frequentlythan those on the West Coast, but they can be felt over a broader area. This particular quake rattled parts of New England as far south as Boston and Rhode Island around 10:22 am EST.

Here's what you need to know about where earthquakes typically occur, how earthquakes are measured, and the damage that the strongest earthquakes can cause.

(Learn how to stay safe during these disastrous events.)

Some 80 percent of all the planet's earthquakes occur along the rim of the Pacific Ocean, called the ""ring of fire"" because of the preponderance of volcanic activity there, as well. Most earthquakes occur at fault zones, wheretectonic plates—giant rock slabs that make up Earth's upper layer—collide or slide against each other.

These impacts are usually gradual and unnoticeable on the surface; however, immense stress can build up between plates. When this stress is released quickly, it sends massive vibrations, called seismic waves, often hundreds of miles through the rock and up to the surface. Other quakes can occur far from fault zones when plates are stretched or squeezed.

There are several different types of faults, including a normal dip slip fault, reverse fault, and strike-slip fault. Here's what they mean.Strike-SlipWhen portions of the Earth's crust moves sideways, the result is a horizontal motion along a ""strike-slip"" fault.The most famous example is California's San Andreas Fault, which stretches some 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from southern California to north of San Francisco. The sideways motion of the fault's branches is caused by the Pacific Ocean's crustal plate moving to the northwest under North America's continental crust.Dip-SlipUp-and-down motions in earthquakes occur over so-called ""dip-slip"" faults, where the ground above the fault zone either drops (a normal fault) or is pushed up (a reverse fault). A normal fault occurs where the deeper part of the crust is pulling away from an overlying part. A reverse is, well, just the reverse.An example of a normal fault is the 240-mile (150-kilometer) long Wasatch Fault underlying parts of Utah and Idaho, again caused by the Pacific plate driving under western North America. One magnitude 7.0 quake along the fault perhaps 550 years ago dropped the ground on one side of the fault by three feet (a meter). The U.S. Geological Survey sees the fault as posing a risk of more magnitude 7.0 earthquakes.ObliqueFaults that combine sideways with up-and-down motions are called oblique by seismologists. The Santa Clara Valley south of San Francisco holds a fault prone to oblique motions, for example, seen in a 1999 quake.

Scientists assign a magnitude rating to earthquakes based on the strength and duration of their seismic waves. A quake measuring 3 to 4.9 is considered minor or light; 5 to 6.9 is moderate to strong; 7 to 7.9 is major; and 8 or more is great.

Earthquakes are always followed by aftershocks, which are smaller quakes that strike after the main quake and can continue for weeks—or even up to years in some cases.According to the USGS, some earthquakes also have foreshocks, or smaller quakes that precede a larger earthquake.

Thestrongest earthquake ever recordedwas a magnitude 9.5 quake that struck southern Chile in 1960. TheValdivia earthquake—named for the city that suffered the most damage—killed about 1,655 people and left another two million homeless. It also triggered a tsunami that spread across the Pacific and flooded coastlines in Japan, Hawaii, and New Zealand.

On average, a magnitude 8 quake strikes somewhere every year, and some 10,000 people die in earthquakes annually. Collapsing buildings claim by far the majority of lives, but the destruction is often compounded by mud slides, fires,floods, ortsunamis. Smaller temblors that usually occur in the days following a large earthquake can complicate rescue efforts and cause further death and destruction.

Loss of life can be avoided through emergency planning,education, and the construction of buildings that sway rather than break under the stress of an earthquake.

22,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/green-arabia-desert-lush-ancient-landscape,"A new study reconstructing the Arabian Peninsula’s ancient past adds clues to how early humans left the African continent.

A new study of stalagmites in caves in central Saudi Arabiaprovides strong evidence that the region was lush and green for much of the last eight million years—a phenomenon known as “Green Arabia,” but until now only a hypothesis.

The study also indicates that the central band of theworld’s “barrier” deserts—from the Sahara in the west, across Arabia and to India’s Thar Desert in the east—were at times well-watered, savannah-like landscapes that encouraged the migrations of primates and other animals out of Africa, includingHomo sapiensand some of our hominin ancestors.

“The sand seas that we are used to seeing have not always been the case,” says archaeologist Michael Petraglia, the director of the Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution at Griffith University. “That has had a huge effect on human evolution.”

Petraglia is a senior author of the study, published inNature. He has worked on the Green Arabia theory since 2010, mainly using studies of sediment cores taken from the region’s ancient dried-up lakes.

The cores contained traces of the plants that once grew there and the types of sediments produced by the climate, and showed that Arabia—and likely the Sahara and the eastern deserts—had been humid for long periods.

But the sediment cores only dated back to the last half million years or so.

The new climate data from the central Saudi Arabian caves, however, was used to reconstruct the region’s climate over the last eight million years—a dramatic advance.

The key data comes fromseven caves at As Sulb, an eroded limestone plateau northeast of Riyadh in central Saudi Arabia, where22 rock samples were taken in 2019.

The samples were mostly from stalagmites, which grow upward from a cave floor as mineral-infused water slowly drips on them (their counterparts, stalactites, grow down from the cave ceiling.)

University of Malta archaeologist Huw Groucutt, one of the study authors, says stalagmites more often contain the evidence that scientists are looking for, including the traces of lead, uranium, and thorium used to date them.

Uranium-thorium dating works by comparing radioactive traces of uranium in the samples to the thorium it decays into. Thismethod provides accurate dates over the last 600,000 years.

But uranium-lead dating is a relatively new technique that compares the uranium isotopes to the lead they decay into over a longer period. This can date a stalagmite over a much longer time—around 7.44 million years ago, in this case.

The new climate record agrees with evidence Petraglia has championedin other studiesabout Green Arabia, which suggest the entire band of deserts that separate most of Africa from Eurasia—including the Sahara and deserts farther east—were verdant for long stretches of time.

He says Arabia is often unnoticedin diagrams that purport to show the routes animals and early humans used to disperse from Africa.

But a green Arabia could have been a key route for such migrations.

And when Arabia was humid, Petraglia says, the Sahara and other deserts would have been humid too—climate changes that may have been caused byperiodic variations in Earth’s orbits around the sun.

“These findings have been spectacular,” Petraglia says. “This is an entirely new source of [climate] information, not only for Arabia but for many places around the world.”

The new paper describes evidence of at least six humid phases in Arabia over the last eight million years, and possibly two more unconfirmed humid phases.

Groucutt explains that the stalagmites grew larger only when the environment was wet enough for water to seep through the ground and into the cave, while the isotopes in the rock samples revealed when these times of growth had occurred.

The study shows that Arabia’s humid periodsin length from more than a million years to tens of thousands of years—long enough for waves of animals and early humans to wander into Arabia from northern Africa and continue on into the fertile lands beyond.

And there is more to come. Petraglia explains that scientific research on caves in the region has been conducted for several years, but it has all been unpublished until now: “we’re just at the beginning of cave work in Saudi Arabia.”

Groucutt describes expeditions that have already taken place to retrieve samples from caves in the northern parts of the Arabian peninsula, which could help refine the geographical extent of the humid phases.

Palaeoclimatologist Paul Wilsonof the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom, who was not involved in the new study, says he was “blown away” by the reconstructed climate record, which had far greater detail than any that had existed until now.

His own research with deep-sea sediments showed they contained less dust from the Sahara during severalwet periods over the last 11 million yearsthat also correlate with variations in Earth’s orbit around the sun.

But while Africa has been well studied in recent years, Arabia has mostly been overlooked, he says: “This is a really powerful validation of some of the things that we've long expected.”

23,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/plastic-pollution,"Children play on the shore of Manila Bay in the Philippines, which is polluted by plastic waste.

Much of the planet is swimming in discarded plastic, which is harming animal and possibly human health. Can it be cleaned up?

Plastic pollution has become one of the mostpressing environmental issues, as rapidly increasing production of disposable plastic products overwhelms the world’s ability to deal with them. Plastic pollution is most visible in developing Asian and African nations, where garbage collection systems are often inefficient or nonexistent. But the developed world, especially in countries withlow recycling rates, also has trouble properly collecting discarded plastics. Plastic trash has become so ubiquitous it has prompted efforts towrite a global treatynegotiated by the United Nations.

Plastics made from fossil fuels are just over a century old. Belgian chemistLeo Baekelandcreated the first fully synthetic plastic in 1907. Production and development of thousands of new plastic products acceleratedafter World War II, so transforming the modern age that life without plastics would be unrecognizable today. In plastic, inventors found a light, durable material that can be used in everything from transportation to medicine.

Plastics revolutionized medicine with life-saving devices, made space travel possible, lightened cars and jets—saving fuel and pollution—and saved lives with helmets, incubators, and equipment for clean drinking water.

The conveniences plastics offer, however, led to a throw-away culture that reveals the material’s dark side: today, single-use plastics account for 40 percent of the plastic produced every year. Many of these products, such asplastic bagsand food wrappers, have a lifespan of mere minutes to hours, yet they may persist in the environment for hundreds of years.

That's why some governments have taken steps to limit or ban the use of plastic bags. Most recently, California passed legislation to ban all plastic bags by 2026.

Some key facts:

Half of all plastics ever manufactured have been made in the last 20 years.





Most of the plastic trash in the oceans, Earth’s last sink, flows from land. Trash is also carried to sea bymajor rivers, which act as conveyor belts, picking up more and more trash as they move downstream. Once at sea, much of the plastic trash remains in coastal waters. But once caught up in ocean currents, it can be transported around the world.

OnHenderson Island, an uninhabited atoll in the Pitcairn Group isolated halfway between Chile and New Zealand, scientists found plastic items from Russia, the United States, Europe, South America, Japan, and China. They were carried to the South Pacific by the South Pacific gyre, a circular ocean current.

Once at sea, sunlight, wind, and wave action break down plastic waste into small particles, often less than one-fifth of an inch across. These so-called microplastics are spread throughout the water column and have been found in every corner of the globe, from Mount Everest, the highest peak, to theMariana Trench, the deepest trough.

Microplastics are breaking down further into smaller and smaller pieces. Plastic microfibers, meanwhile, have been found in municipal drinking water systems and drifting through theair.

It's no surprise then that scientists have found microplastics in people. The tiny particles are in our blood, lungs, and even infeces. Exactly how much microplastics might be harming human health is a question scientists are urgently trying to answer.

Learn more about the microplastics in our bodies and how much do they harm us.

Millions of animals are killed by plastics every year, from birds to fish to other marine organisms. Nearly2,100 species, including endangered ones, are known to have been affected by plastics. Nearly every species of seabird eats plastics.

Most of the deaths to animals are caused by entanglement or starvation. Seals,whales, turtles, and other animals are strangled byabandoned fishing gearor discardedsix-pack rings. Microplastics have beenfoundin more than 100 aquatic species, including fish, shrimp, and mussels destined for our dinner plates. In many cases, these tiny bits pass through the digestive system and are expelled without consequence. But plastics have also been found to have blocked digestive tracts or pierced organs, causing death. Stomachs so packed with plastics reduce the urge to eat, causing starvation.

Plastics have been consumed by land-based animals, including elephants, hyenas, zebras, tigers, camels, cattle, and other large mammals, in some casescausing death.

Tests have also confirmed liver and cell damage and disruptions toreproductive systems,prompting some species, such asoysters,to produce fewer eggs. New research shows thatlarval fish are eating nanofibersin the first days of life, raising new questions about the effects of plastics on fish populations.

Once in the ocean, it is difficult—if not impossible—to retrieve plastic waste. Mechanical systems, such asMr. Trash Wheel, a litter interceptor in Maryland’s Baltimore Harbor, can be effective at picking up large pieces of plastic, such as foam cups and food containers, from inland waters. But once plastics break down into microplastics and drift throughout the water column in the open ocean, they are virtually impossible to recover.

The solution is to prevent plastic waste from entering rivers and seas in the first place, many scientists andconservationistssay. This could be accomplished with improved waste management systems andrecycling, better product design that takes into account the short life of disposable packaging, and a reduction in manufacturing of unnecessary single-use plastics.

24,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/salmon-tires-health-chemical,"Scientists have learned that particles from car tires are a leading culprit in salmon declines in the Pacific Northwest—and are in our bodies as well.

On the banks of an unassuming creek south of Seattle, biologist Nathan Ivy packed a pair of dripping waders and a cooler full of petri dishes into the back of his pickup truck, and peeled away towards the highway.

As he merged south on Interstate-5, he was uniquely aware that from this river of cars, including his own, issued an imperceptible and deadly chemical—the same chemical, he knew, disfiguring the vermillion salmon eggs in the petri dishes packed away beside him.

For decades, researchers suspected that a strange chemical in Washington’s streams was causing unnatural numbers of adult coho salmon to wash up dead after heavy rains, their bellies full of unlaid eggs. In 2020, after years of Curie-like obsession, a team of scientists finally identified the deadly chemical in roadway stormwater runoff as 6PPD-quinone. Its parent chemical, they confirmed, is in virtually every tire in the world.

Every year, every person in the U.S. sheds almost six pounds of 6PPD-carrying tire dust onto America’s highways and roads, where it’s swept by rain or wind off into the environment. The chemical is everywhere, say scientists. It has already been found in waterways around the world, in the air, and in human blood and urine. For coho, a keystone species in the Pacific Northwest food chain and a cultural pillar for Native American tribes in the region, the prognosis is dire.

“It kills them pretty quick,” said Ivy, who is monitoring the impact of 6PPD-quinone from one contaminated stream in Washington on the lifecycle of coho grown in those waters. “We’re talking symptomatic within 45 minutes of a lethal dose.”

Scientists are now hurriedly looking for an alternative to a chemical that tire manufacturers have come to depend on as an essential anti-degradant, while environmentalists scramble for legal solutions.

These efforts may move too slowly. Many stormwater drains feed into rivers and streams where adult coho return each fall to spawn, especially in urban areas like Seattle. Since the 1990s, Seattle’s active citizen science groups have recorded masses of dead coho washing up after storms. The fish die within hours of a 6PPD-quinone surge, first swimming deliriously in circles, mouths agape as if gasping for air.

Dr. Jenifer McIntyre has observed that graceless death hundreds of times. She’s one of the key researchers in the unlikely discovery of 6PPD-quinone and now an associate professor of aquatic toxicology at Washington State University, where she oversees the Puyallup Research and Extension Center that serves as a hub for 6PPD-quinone researchers like Ivy.

Barely a decade ago, tipped off by citizen scientists and growing concern in the research community, McIntyre was just running her first stormwater exposure experiments on salmon. Isolating a single mysterious chemical out of the thousands floating in highway stormwater runoff would require a mammoth effort, she knew. And a mass spectrometer.

Ed Kolodziej, an environmental engineer at the University of Washington, had one handy.

When he ran the first stormwater samples through the machine, which measures atomic mass of chemicals to reveal their molecular structures, he was shocked by the amount of stuff in the water. “Holy mackerel, there’s a lot of chemicals here,” Kolodziej recalled.

To narrow the search, McIntyre tried isolating common substances known to ooze from cars, such as windshield wiper fluids, used motor oil, and tire wear particles. The tire soup was the only solution that killed.

That breakthrough in 2017 cleared enough chaff for Kolodziej and Zhenyu Tian, a post-doctoral researcher working on the project, to commence the painstaking task of winnowing down the remaining solution to its final, deadly chemical.

For another two years, they passed solutions back and forth—out of the mass spectrometer, then into the team’s fish tanks at their lab in Puyallup.

In 2019, they had isolated just four chemicals. But the researchers knew them only by their molecular structures—there was no trace of them in the available literature on tires.

Then, a textbook eureka moment. Tian had a thought in the shower: maybe one of the compounds was slightly transformed from its original by the environment, a quinone. A cursory web search proved him right. A chemical with similar bones as the quinone was listed in a 1983 tire industry paper.

“It was literally like, a near-heroic effort,” said Kolodziej of the work.

Between 50 and 100 million pounds of 6PPD are produced each year in the U.S., often as purplish pellets, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Tian put in an online order the same day to ship some to the lab.

Response to the2021 study, authored by Tian, quickly ballooned.

“Toxicologists all over the world are ... greedily rubbing their hands together like, ‘Oh my goodness, a new very toxic chemical that we can study,’” McIntyre said, jokingly, from her office at the Washington State University Puyallup Research and Extension Center, where she oversees a hive of researchers closely studying the 6PPD-quinone.

New research has shown the chemical to be lethal in varying degrees to rainbow trout, brook trout, and white-spotted char. It isnow knownto be floating in human urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, especially ofpregnant women. A 2024 peer-reviewed study found that the chemical likely enters the human body through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact, and posits that 6PPD-quinone can quickly reach tissues and major organs, especially the liver and lungs. It’s not known to be toxic to humans at the levels observed right now, but that research could have other implications.

“Although it doesn’t look like we have the acute lethal response that [other species] have, we’re starting to learn about sub-lethal consequences that could certainly be important to humans,” said McIntyre.

Ivy is one of the biologists working to unveil the sub-lethal effects of the ubiquitous quinone. From a lab on the banks of Miller Creek in Puyallup, he monitors two sets of salmon eggs—one raised in water from the nearby creek and one raised in filtered water.

Tubing carries water from the creek into the upgraded shed that serves as Ivy’s lab, and cascades over stacked trays holding hundreds of coho eggs and alevin. Stormwater regularly leaks into Miller Creek from nearby Highway 509.

With water quality and egg development data, Ivy will be able to track the sub-lethal effects—stressors that don’t immediately kill but still hurt the salmon—of 6PPD-quinone on coho, he explained, while plucking a few stream-fed embryos from a shelf with forceps to bring back to the WSU lab overseen by McIntyre.

In another nearby tray filled with clean water, tiny just-hatched salmon wriggled frantically. The embryos and the hatched fish were the same age, but the stream-fed fish were growing lethargically.

Tire manufacturers have baked 6PPD into their products regularly since the mid-1970s to keep them from degrading and cracking, according to the Interstate Technology Regulatory Council. The companies say 6PPD is an essentialsafety featurethat extends the life of a tire, meaning less cost to the car owner and fewer accidents from blown tires.

Today, at least 5.5 pounds of tiny tire particles are shed per person in the United States each year, according to the California Environmental Protection Agency.Those particles carry 6PPD into polluted air near the ground, where it picks up two hydrogen and two oxygen atomsand transforms into a quinone. Rain sweeps this altered 6PPD into the environment, where it may end up swirling in the eddies of a salmon stream.

The paths to regulating or replacing 6PPD are slow. Alawsuitfiled by a non-profit group in California alleges that the largest tire manufacturers in the U.S. violated the Endangered Species Act by allowing 6PPD-quinone to kill populations of endangered coho. (Since coho populations are genetically distinct from one another, some are classified as endangered while others are not.)

That trial is set for January 2026, said Elizabeth Forsythe, senior attorney in the biodiversity defense program at Earthjustice, the environmental law organization litigating the suit.

Three Native American tribes in the Pacific Northwest are taking another tack through the Toxic Substances Control Act, which regulates the use of toxic chemicals in the U.S. In 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency granted apetitionfrom the Yurok Tribe, the Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe and the Puyallup Tribe of Indians to establish regulations prohibiting the manufacture and use of 6PPD. No timeline has been set for an incominglegislation proposal.

Researchers like Caitlin Lawrence, a graduate student at the Puyallup lab, are trying to identify chemicals that could take the place of 6PPD. The Washington Department of Ecology releaseda reportsoon after the 2021 study was published with a list of potential alternatives.

But the problem with alternatives, said Lawrence, is that any could be just as covertly reactive to the environment as 6PPD. Environmental toxins in general are poorly understood, she said, and it doesn’t take a lot for them to have a massive impact.

Still, 6PPD and 6PPD-quinone don’t stick around in water in the same way as forever chemicals. The half-life for 6PPD is about three hours; for the quinone it’s a little longer, which means “it’s only persistent because we’re driving every day,” and constantly releasing tire particles, said Lawrence.

Soil and sediment filtration systems are effective at keeping stormwater junk from entering the environment. But there’s not enough funding floating around to cover Seattle in rain gardens.

The problem isn’t intractable, insist Ivy and Lawrence. Their research could prod manufacturers to change from within, or legislation to change them from without. New data informs water quality regulations that impact fragile watersheds, and helps researchers identify which coho populations would benefit most from filtration systems.

“I think we can live in harmony with them, even in an urban setting,” said Ivy. “It just takes being careful where we tread.”

25,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/ancient-oyster-shells-protect-georgia-coast,"The barrier islands off the coast of Georgia are littered with millions of oysters left behind by Indigenous peoples. New research shows they’re still protecting the land.

On the barrier islands off the coast of Georgia,around 585 square miles of salt marshes lie next to forests so dense with hardwoods and Spanish moss that sunshine can only filter through in slender rays.

“They’re almost otherworldly,” saysJacob Holland-Lulewicz, an archaeologist at Pennsylvania State University. To visitors, these islands can feel untouched.

Yet, recent research by Holland-Lulewicz and his colleagues shows how humans have significantly altered these barrier islands over millennia by discardingmillions of oyster shells, unintentionally creating deposits so substantial they now protect portions of the islands from today's rising sea levels.

“These ecosystems that we all enjoy and that we want to preserve are actually the result of thousands of years of indigenous peoples managing these places,"" says Holland-Lulewicz. By challenging conventional views of what constitutes ""natural"" landscapes, the study, recently published inCommunications Earth&Environment,shows how ancient human activity both preserved the islands’ ecosystem and bolstered its coasts.

Previous studieshave shown that Georgia’s barrier islands were formed from shifting sea levels, currents, and sand deposits, possibly starting as long as 110,000 years ago. As sea levels plateaued during the Holocene, around 5,000 years ago, modern island configurations emerged.

Archaeological evidence indicates that Indigenous people, ancestors of the Muskogee Creek Nation, inhabited these islands shortly after they formed. They lived off the sea, consuming oysters.

Today, piles of ancient oyster shells are noticeable to people like Holland-Lulewicz, trained to see anomalies in soil layers. In some locations, the oyster mounds are imposing.

“They tower over us,” Holland-Lulewicz says. Scientists also found that calcium-rich shells encouraged specific plants, such as small-flowered buckthorn and Piedmont flatsedge, to grow on the barrier islands.

The team conducted a grueling survey of the islands. On four islands, they dug pits every 65 feet in a grid, measuring the thickness of shell deposits.

“Those were hard, hard days in the field,” saysVictor Thompson, an archaeologist from the University of Georgia, Athens who was a co-author on the paper and has worked on the islands for 20 years.

They found evidence of past habitation—such as broken pottery, shell beads, and stone tools—across 65 percent of the islands. Oyster shells were strewn over a quarter of them. While the percentage might seem modest, the volume of oysters is remarkable: one 163-acre section of Sapelo Island is made up of around 1.6 billion oyster shells. “Human action is interwoven into the landscape,” Thompson says.

To assess how the islands might appear today without this human influence, the study authors analyzed elevation data from the U.S. Geological Survey and water level measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Their findings revealed that without the added elevation from accumulated oyster shells, significant portions of the coastline would be submerged during high tides. Nearly five percent of Patterson Island, for example, would be regularly underwater. Even more land would face inundation during ""King Tides"" and storm surges caused by hurricanes and tropical storms.

The researchers also described how indigo, cotton, and rice plantations built in the 18th century using enslaved labor were intentionally established at locations that had been large Indigenous settlements hundreds of years earlier.

This placement wasn't coincidental—plantation owners recognized that the calcium carbonate and nutrients mixed into the earth created fertile soil. The Gullah-Geechee people, descendants of enslaved Africans living on Georgia’s barrier islands, also specifically valued land enriched with oyster shells.

The study is part of a broader movement challenging traditional notions of conservation, saysJayur Madhusudan Mehta, an archaeologist at Florida State University who was not involved in the research. The paper suggests that the baseline against which change is measured isn’t necessarily a time before human involvement.

“This is good research, and it's valuable,” he says, because it shows what kind of designs could be applied to new coastal projects designed to protect Georgia’s eastern coastline from worsening storms and rising seas.

Shell to Shore, a nonprofit organization, collects oyster shells from restaurants around the state to return them to the shore. They’ve accumulated over 250,000 pounds of oyster shells and are finalizing permits to dispose of them on the shoreline of Sapelo Island to fortify locations prone to storm surges.

When Tyler Leslie, one of Shell to Shore’s co-founders, hears of the state’s ancient bivalve-eating history, he feels connected to the communities that ate oysters and tossed their shells on the beach thousands of years ago.

“We've always been mindful of these shells as humans,” Leslie says. “There's a historical relationship.”

On Georgia’s barrier islands, that relationship has helped to foster a resilient environment. ""It's important to bust this myth that all human impacts and legacies on landscapes necessarily are bad,” he says, “There are a lot of things that humans can do to improve landscapes and to manage them in ways that are really important.""

26,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/hurricanes-typhoons-cyclones,"Here’s how they form, why they can be so deadly, and how to best prepare for them.

Hurricanes combine unyielding winds and torrential rain to create some of Earth’s most powerful storms. When hurricanes near land, wind can cause devastating damage, even spawning tornadoes. But the bigger danger is rain, which can cause catastrophic, and often deadly, flooding.

These storms gain energy from warm water and its winds whirl in a characteristic circular motion. Tropical storms are named once winds pass 39 miles per hour, and are deemed hurricanes when winds pass 74 miles per hour. Hurricanes are rated by categories onthe Saffir-Simpson scale.

The same type of storm has different names depending on the region of the world: “hurricanes” develop over the North Atlantic, central North Pacific, and eastern North Pacific, “cyclones” form over the South Pacific and Indian Ocean, and “typhoons“ develop in the Northwest Pacific.

(Do female hurricanes really kill more people than male ones?)

But how are hurricanes formed? And can tracking and preparedness actually help mitigate hurricane damage? Here’s what you need to know about hurricanes.

Centuries ago European explorers learned the Indigenous Caribbean wordhurakan, signifying evil spirits and weather gods, to describe the storms that battered their ships in the Caribbean.

The Atlantic Ocean’s hurricane season peaks from mid-August to late October and averages five to six hurricanes per year. While cyclones on the northern Indian Ocean typically form between April and December, with peak storm activity around May and November.

Hurricanesbegin as tropical disturbancesin warm ocean waters with surface temperatures of at least 80°F. Those low-pressure systems are fed by energy from warm seas.

A storm with wind speeds of 38 miles an hour or less is classified as a tropical depression. It becomes a tropical storm—and is given a name, according to conventions determined by theWorld Meteorological Organization—when its sustained wind speeds top 39 miles an hour.

Hurricanes are enormous heat engines that deliver energy on a staggering scale. They draw heat from warm, moist ocean air and release it through condensation of water vapor in thunderstorms.

Hurricanes spin around alow-pressure center known as the eye. Sinking air makes this 20- to 40-mile-wide area notoriously calm. But the eye is surrounded by a circular “eye wall” that contains the storm’s strongest winds and rain.

Hurricanes bring destruction ashore in many different ways. When a hurricane makes landfall, it often produces a devastatingstorm surge—ocean water pushed ashore by wind—that can reach 20 feet (6 meters) high and move several miles inland.

Storm surges and floodingare the two most dangerous aspects of hurricanes, accounting for three-quarters of deaths from Atlantic tropical cyclones,according to a 2014 study. A third of the 1,200 deaths fromHurricane Katrina, which made landfall off the coast of Louisiana in 2005, were caused by drowning. Katrina is also thecostliest hurricane on record, with damage totaling $125 billion.

A hurricane’shigh winds are destructiveand may spawntornadoes. Torrential rains cause further damage via flooding and landslides, which may occur many miles inland.

Although extremely potent storms have formed in the Atlantic, the mostpowerful tropical cyclones on recordhave formed in the Pacific, which gives storms more room to grow before they make landfall. Hurricane Patricia, which formed in the eastern Pacific off Guatemala in 2015, had the strongest winds recorded, at 215 miles an hour. The strongest Atlantic storm was Wilma in 2005, with winds of 183 miles an hour.

Thebest defenseagainst a hurricane is an accurate forecast that gives people time to get out of the way. TheNational Hurricane Centerissues hurricane watches for possible storms within 48 hours and hurricane warnings for expected storms within 36 hours.

Climate changemay be driving more frequent, more intense extreme weather, and that includes hurricanes. The2018 hurricane seasonwas one of the most active on record, with 22 major hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere in under three months, and2017 also saw seriously devastating Atlantic storms. While a number of factors determine a hurricane's strength and impact,warmer temperaturesin certain locations play an important role. In the Atlantic, warming in the Arctic coulddrive future hurricane tracks farther west, making a U.S. landfall more likely.

(Are there solutions to climate change?)

Hurricane Harvey, which dropped a record-breaking 51.8 inches of rain on southeastern Texas in 2017, was fueled by surface waters in the Gulf of Mexico that were 2°F warmer than three decades before. A warmer atmosphere can also furnish more water vapor for making rain, as evaporation increases and warm air holds more vapor than cold.

Warming temperatures can alsoslow tropical cyclones, which can be a problem if their progression over land is extended, potentially increasing storm surges, rainfall, and exposure to high winds.

Potential trends make it more important than ever tobe preparedfor coming storms and to address the rootcauses of climate change, scientists say.

27,National Geographic,Environment,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/how-cherry-trees-breathe,"The trees exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen with the atmosphere through little “mouths” in their leaves and tiny “windows” in their bark.

What’s the first thing you do when you get into your car after it’s been sitting in the hot sun all day? Open the windows! Well, trees also need windows in their trunks and branches to let air circulate.

If you’re thinking “Wait! I learned in botany class that the exchange of gases occurs in the leaves of trees, not the bark,” you are correct. Leaves have tiny holes in their surfaces—called stomata, or “little mouths”—that open and close to let tree leaves draw incarbon dioxideand release oxygen forphotosynthesis.

(The Earth has lungs. Watch them breathe.)

But trees also respire, just as we do, pulling in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Andrespirationoccurs in the cells of all living tree tissues, not just the leaves.

So how can this exchange take place in the parts of trees that aren’t leaves, like trunks and branches, tissues that don’t have stomata? It’s a puzzle, because tree bark is the first line of protection for a tree. It acts as an impermeable layer that prevents insects and diseases from getting to a tree’s interior structures.

(How cherry blossoms came to America.)

Think of the trunk of a cherry tree, with its narrow lines etched into the bark. Those lines—called lenticels, or “little windows”— are actually portals in the bark that let the tree breathe. These lens-shaped slits in the bark allow gases to pass between living cells on the inside and the air outside.

Botanists also use the shape of lenticels to identify trees. Some trees, like cherry and birch, have really prominent lenticels, but most are invisible to the human eye. Even if you can’t see them, they’re there, helping trees survive through even the hottest days they encounter.

28,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/heart-attacks-rising-young-adults-risk-factors,"Research shows that heart attacks are becoming more prevalent among adults younger than 50—and the outcomes are worse for women. The good news is we know how to prevent them.

Despite declines among older adults, the proportion of heart attacks among younger adults is increasing across the globe—an alarming trend that many doctors who spoke toNational Geographicconsider a public health emergency. (Young adults are loosely defined as those between 20 to 50 years old.)

Mounting evidence also shows that more young adults are experiencing all kinds of heart problems compared to decades past, and that worsening lifestyle habits—namely, poor diet and lack of exercise—are to blame. And some research suggests that COVID infections are adding insult to injury.

(It's not just heart attacks. Colon cancer is rising among young adults.)

Recent events have underscored these concerns. In 2024, a healthy 38-year-old made headlines afterhe had a heart attack and collapsed while running the New York City Triathlon, despite having no known risk factors. And in 2023, fans were left stunned after 18-year-old Bronny James, the oldest son of NBA star LeBron James, collapsed after going into cardiac arrest during basketball practice at the University of Southern California. (He has since resumed playing following surgery to treat what his family said was acongenital heart defect.)

The event, andseveral otherslike it, raises questions more broadly about cardiovascular health and young people.

“Young individuals are not immune from cardiac arrest or heart attack, yet many think that this is still a disease of older folks,” says Ron Blankstein, senior preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston. “But the really important thing for young individuals to know is that cardiovascular disease, for the most part, can be prevented if you take the right steps.”

Heart attacks, also called myocardial infarctions, occur when blood flow into the heart is partially or completely blocked. Common symptoms include chest pain or discomfort; pain that radiates into the jaw, neck, back or arms; shortness of breath; and feeling weak or faint.

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, 0.3 percent of adults in the U.S. ages 18 to 44had a heart attackin 2019 compared to 0.5 percent in 2023. That’s a 66 percent increase over four years. Meanwhile, heart attacks decreased among all other age groups over the same period.

A study of more than 2,000 young adults admitted for heart attack between 2000 and 2016 in two U.S. hospitals found that1 in 5 were 40 years old or younger—and that the proportion of this group has been increasing by 2 percent each year for the last decade.

The study, published in 2019 in theAmerican Journal of Medicine, also found that people ages 40 or younger who have had a heart attack are just as likely as older adults to die from another heart attack, stroke, or other reason.

(Strokes are on the rise—and these are the reasons why.)

In fact, increases in heart disease among younger adults between 2020 and 2021 were responsible for more than 4 percent of thedeclines in U.S. life expectancyin that year, according to a 2023 editorial published inJAMA Network.

Not to mention, more young adults are dying ofheart failure, which is when your heart can’t pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs. (Heart failure can be caused by anything that weakens the muscle, such as coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and heart attacks.) A study published last year in JAMA Cardiology found that deaths among people aged 45 and younger from 2012 to 2021 were responsible for completely reversing13 years’ worth of declinesin heart failure-related mortality from 1999 to 2012.

Cardiac arrest, however, is a different situation: It occurs when the heart experiences an electrical malfunction and suddenly stops beating. Because cardiac arrest can be caused by several conditions—like cardiomyopathy (thickened heart muscle), heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), and heart attacks—it’s difficult for doctors to study and determine whether it’s becoming more common in young adults.

The problem isn’t uniquely American. Research shows that adults in Pakistan andIndia, for example, are also experiencing heart attacks at younger ages. “Cardiovascular disease doesn't know international boundaries,” Blankstein said, “and neither do the risk factors.”

And though heart attacks typically strike men more often than women, recent studies have suggested that more younger women are experiencing heart attacks compared to younger men—and that their outcomes are worse.

(Alcohol is much worse for women than men. Here’s why.)

A 2018 investigation published in the journalCirculationfound that the overall proportion ofheart attack hospitalizations among people ages 35 to 54in four regions of the U.S. increased from 27 percent in 1995-99 to 32 percent in 2010-14. The largest increase occurred in young women (21 percent to 31 percent) compared to young men (30 percent to 33 percent).

The young women in the study were more often Black and had a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and prior stroke.

Studies have found that clinicians are more likely to dismiss symptoms and underdiagnose certain risk factors in women, and areless likely to prescribe them medicationsto help manage their risks.

Overall, women aremore likely than men to die from a heart attackand develop heart failure in the five years after their hospitalization, according to a 2024 report by the McKinsey Health Institute and the American Heart Association. Today, cardiovascular disease remains theleading cause of death in womenin the U.S.

Themajority of researchshows that more people, particularly those of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, aredeveloping risk factorsfor heart disease at younger ages—and that most of the young, seemingly healthy people who have a heart attack almost alwayshave at least one underlying condition.

The biggest risk factors are high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and obesity, all of which can clog and damage the arteries and blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart.

While some of these conditions may be genetic, more often they’re brought on by years of unhealthy habits like poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle thattypically begin early in childhood, says Eugene Yang, a preventive cardiologist and former chair of the American College of Cardiology Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases Council.

COVID, on the other hand, appears to have a more immediate impact on cardiovascular health. A 2022 study published in theJournal of Medical Virologyfound thatheart attack deaths increased by 14 percentwithin the first year of the pandemic. The greatest increase was found among adults aged 25 to 44. More recent research suggests that COVID canincrease heart attack risk for up to three yearspost-infection among some young unvaccinated adults. On the flip side, COVID vaccines have been found tolower the risk of heart attacksamong all adults.

(How COVID-19 harms the heart.)

COVID is known to activate inflammatory responses in the body and make blood thicker and stickier, Yang said, which can make infected people more susceptible to blood clots that can clog arteries and lead to heart attack. However, it’s still not clear why younger adults appear to be more vulnerable to COVID’s cardiovascular complications.

Other factors liketobacco, cocaine,marijuana, andalcoholuse have been associated with increased risks of heart attack in younger adults too. Research also shows thatracism and discrimination, such as segregated neighborhoods and workplace inequality, can have major impacts on cardiovascular health and access to quality care, which can explain why young people of color face greater risks for heart problems.

Yet, most young adults aren’t concerned. A 2023 survey by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center found that 47 percent of people under age 45don’t think they’re at risk for heart disease; a third of all adults surveyed said they wouldn’t confidently know whether they were having a heart attack.

Similarly, just half of 3,500 younger adults who had significant risk factors believed they were at risk for heart diseasebefore their heart attack occurred; even fewer reported that their doctors told them they were at risk, especially women.

Getting younger adults to care about heart health is a unique challenge, experts say; they’re busy building families and careers and are theleast likely age group to have health insurance.

But it’s not all their fault. The health care system isn’t designed to effectively evaluate and treat younger adults with heart disease, Blankstein said, fueling a bias among clinicians that younger patients are at low risk.

Since 2013, themost widely used “risk calculator”developed by the American Heart Association, for example, only assessed risks for those ages 40-79. It wasn’t until 2023 that the newPREVENT calculatorincluded people ages 30 and older.

Further, most young adults who had a heart attackwould not have been eligible for cholesterol treatmentunder current guidelines before their heart attack occurred; women face even lower eligibility compared with men, despite similar risk factors.

Early prevention is key. The longer you live with risk factors, the greater your chances of developing heart disease and experiencing worse outcomes later in life, especially if left untreated.

“Take a good look at your risk factors,” says Mariell Jessup, chief science and medical officer with the AHA, “and then develop a plan about how you can tackle one or more of those.”

The AHA recommends following “Life’s Essential 8”: key measures that, if practiced, can improve and maintain your cardiovascular health. These include a healthy diet, regular physical activity, no tobacco smoking, and sufficient sleep, as well as managing your weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.

A 2024 study published in the AHA journal found that adults ages 21-27 who followed these guidelines more closely hadthinner, less stiff, and overall healthier carotid artery walls(the major blood vessels in your neck) compared to those who didn’t follow them as well. In other words, they had lower risks for cardiovascular disease and heart attacks.

“Young adulthood is a phenomenal opportunity for prevention of cardiovascular disease, which goes hand in hand with overall health,” says John Wilkins, associate professor of medicine in cardiology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “The better job we can do at getting young adults at these optimal levels, the greater chance they have at a longer health span.”

29,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/zanclean-mega-flood-mediterranean-animated-video,"Scientists reveal new details about the 5.3-million-year-old flood, which triggered earthquakes, generated tropical-storm force winds, and created a waterfall 30 times taller than Niagara.

Six million years ago, the Mediterranean Sea wasn’t nearly as picturesque as it is today. It was barely even a sea; tectonic activity had raised a mountain range in the Strait of Gibraltar, cutting off the Mediterranean from the Atlantic. Without a constant inflow of water the sea evaporated under the baking sun, and all that remained were a few scattered, briny lakes surrounded by mile after mile of salt and gypsum. Today, scientists call this the Messinian Salinity Crisis: in the dying days of the Miocene epoch, most of the Mediterranean died.

But if, on a certain day about 5.3 million years ago, you happened to go for a stroll along that mountain range, you might have discovered something odd: a trickle of water, making its way down one of the mountains from the Atlantic ocean beyond it. The mountains had been slowly sinking until their summits were level with the ocean’s surface; one day, the mountains sank just enough for some of the water to spill over their edges.

Once they did, the water carved an unstoppable path downhill. The trickle turned into a stream, which widened into a river, and soon the ocean was pouring into the desiccated Mediterranean basin with the force of a thousand Amazon Rivers, suddenly ending the 600,000-year-long dry spell.

The water moved so quickly — 32 meters per second, or about 72 miles per hour, by the time it hit the coast of modern-day Sicily — that it dragged the air behind it, creating tropical storm-force winds as it moved. If you managed to somehow see through all the muddy sediment stirred up by the flood waters, you might have found a few surprised fish in the depths, stunned or struck dead outright by the force of the rapids that carried them in from the Atlantic. As the water refilled the Mediterranean, it ushered in a new geological era: theZanclean.

“I don't think any human has ever seen anything like this,” saysAaron Micallef,a National Geographic Explorer and marine geoscientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute who studies this event, called theZanclean megaflood. Micallef and his colleagues have spent years putting together the puzzle pieces of what the flood looked like, and this story is largely built on their research,which melds geologic evidence with computer modeling. While evidence for the flood is still accumulating, this is the scientist’s best picture yet of what’s likely thelargest flood in the history of the Earth.

Micallef and his colleagues found that the Mediterranean, which had been obliterated once when the sea dried up, was transformed completely again by the megaflood.

The fossil record is difficult to read in much detail, but scientists think that before the sea dried up it was filled with all kinds of creatures, from ancient sharks and pinnipeds to fish and a rainbow of coral. Only eighty-six of the 780 or so species from the sea that existed before the salinity crisis have survived into the modern-day Mediterranean, and the fact that they lived through the flood is a minor miracle. Those creatures, a collection of mollusks, plankton, and one standout sea slug, most likely survived by finding refuge in the few patches of water that remained after the sea dried up.

(Rome is teeming with mysterious crypts filled with popes—and secrets)

As the water poured in, the western Mediterranean began refilling at a tremendous rate; Micallef estimates the water flowed at a rate of somewhere between 68 and 100 million cubic meters per second, filling the sea by as much as ten meters, or nearly 33 feet, each day. The weight of the rising waters pressed down on the Earth’s crust, making it slide across the molten mantle underneath. This, saysDaniel Garcia-Castellanos, a Geophysicist at CSIC Barcelona and a pioneer on research into the Zanclean megaflood, would have triggered earthquakes that rippled through the region. For the goat-antelope creatureMyotragus, which had walked across the dry sea to make its home on modern-day Mallorca and Menorca, the earthquakes, water, and wind combined must have sounded like the roar of a monstrous predator — surely, this was the end of the world as they knew it.

Eventually, the rising waters streamed over the lip of Sicily, and as the current moved east it ate away at the land, leaving behind hundreds of long ridges as if a giant hand had clawed through the dirt. A little bit further east, the water hit another wall that we now call the Malta Escarpment. This barrier divided the Mediterranean into west and east, turning the western mediterranean into a giant bowl: for the water to make its way east, it first had to fill the western half of the sea.

Once the western half of the sea filled up enough for the water to make its way over the top of the wall, it tipped over into the east and down a cliff about 1.5 kilometers deep, creating the largest waterfall in the history of our planet; imagine the Niagara Falls, but 30 times taller. The crash of the water triggered more earthquakes, and the flood dumped mounds of sediment at the bottom of the sea as it rushed into the east.

As the water rose in the east to meet the waters of the western Mediterranean, the earth stopped shaking. The wind died down. The water started clearing as it settled, sediment falling to the sea floor. Somewhere between two and sixteen years after the first waters broke through the Strait of Gibraltar — not even the blink of an eye in geological time — the Mediterranean leveled off with the Atlantic.

From the surface, all signs of upheaval disappeared. The Atlantic flowed lazily into the newly reformed Mediterranean, which was now free of walls or waterfalls. This sea, with its comparatively mild waters, looked much as it would millions of years later, when ancient Greece and Rome established themselves on its edges, When the Greek poet Homer wrote of the sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis living off the coast of Sicily, he had no way of knowing that Charybdis, who often takes the form of a whirlpool pulling unfortunate sailors to their death in the depths, had already been upstaged by the sea’s own history.

It would take surprisingly long for any new sea creatures, monstrous or otherwise, to make a home in the Mediterranean.

“In geological terms, we should have been seeing marine fauna immediately, but that’s not what is happening,”Konstantina Agiadi, a geologist at the University of Vienna who co-authored apaperon the impact of the salinity crisis and flood on marine biodiversity. The water in the immediate aftermath of the flooding would have made a poor home, devoid of nutrients and far too salty for most creatures to live in; the ones that existed in the sea before the flood struggled by for a few millennia before the water became hospitable enough for any potential newcomers, and even today the Mediterranean is considerably saltier than the Atlantic. “It took a lot of time for the situation to settle enough for organisms that were coming from the Atlantic to actually establish healthy populations and grow,” Agiadi said.Today, the sea is a biodiversity hotspot, filled with all varieties of sea creatures.

(How archaeologists found one of the oldest cities on Earth)

Even though the flood happened millions of years ago, Micallef says, it holds important clues about the future of our planet. Climate change is making flooding from melting glaciers more common, and understanding the dynamics of the Zanclean megaflood — even though it was much larger than anything we have seen from glaciers so far — can help us model what future flooding will look like, mapping both the flow of water and its effect on the landscape around it.

And, says Agiadi, there’s another important lesson too: The world transformed when the Messinian Salinity Crisis and Zanclean megaflood happened, and there was no going back. The creatures that live in the Mediterranean now, wonderful as they may be, are nothing like what lived there before it dried up. That’s true of climate change too.

“The flood is kind of like a natural experiment,” Agiadi says. “The Mediterranean, after the flooding, eventually became a marine basin that is a biodiversity hotspot today. But it never became, even after millions of years, what it was before. So it’s kind of a natural test of if we can fix things. If you try to bring back a species without fixing the underlying problems, it will never be okay. But it might be something different.”

30,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/dark-energy-desi-universe-future-end,"Cosmologist Katie Mack breaks down what the latest findings about dark energy mean for our universe’s future. Either way, it won’t be happy.

If you had asked me a year ago about the most likely ultimate fate of the universe, I would have been able to answer immediately. As a cosmologist, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the end of the universe—I even wrotea book on the topic. We know the universe is expanding, and that expansion is speeding up. In the far distant future, this accelerating expansion will empty out the cosmos until there’s essentially nothing left. Stars burn out, matter decays, black holes evaporate, and eventually nothing is left but a few stray particles of light diffusing away the waste heat of all creation. This scenario is sometimes called the “heat death” or the “big freeze”, and it’s a straightforward consequence of our best working theory for how the universe behaves.

But if you asked me today, I would hesitate. Theresults announcedin late March by theDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), building on a previous data release last year, paint a very different picture of our universe by challenging our best guess as to the nature of its most important—and most mysterious—component: dark energy.

Whendark energywas first discovered, it was, to put it mildly, a surprise.

In the late 1990s, astronomers discovered that the expansion of the universe,initially set off by the big bang, has been subtly speeding up over the last few billion years. The acceleration was clear in the data, and confirmed by multiple groups, but it didn’t seem to make any sense.

Researchers expected expansion todecelerate, not accelerate. Everything in the cosmos—galaxies,stars, gas, dust, even pure energy—has a gravitational effect on everything else. And gravity pulls objects together, never to pushes them apart. So while astronomers have known for more than a hundred years that distant galaxies are moving away from each other, and moving away from us, with the expansion of the cosmos, the only sensible expectation was that the gravity of all that stuff should resist the expansion and, gradually, slow it down.

If the expansion of the universe was accelerating, though, it was as though something was actively stretching space out from within, over and above the residual expansion from the big bang. Nothing known to exist in the universe should be able to do that.

Fortunately for astronomers, Albert Einstein’stheory of gravity—general relativity—offered a potential loophole. While it was still true that no known substance could make the universe accelerate in its expansion, Einstein did leave open the possibility thatspace itselfcould do the job. In his equations for the evolution of the cosmos, he added a term called a “cosmological constant” —depicted as the Greek letter Λ or “lambda”—that essentially gave space itself the ability to swell from within and push back against gravitational collapse.

When Einstein first proposed it, astronomers didn’t know the universe was expanding. Once observations pointed to an expanding universe, he took the term out of his equations, wrote it off as a mistake, and moved on to more sensible things.

When faced with their unexpected observations of acceleration, modern astronomers thought that perhaps the cosmological constant could explain the unexpected stretching of space. Bizarre as it was, it did.

The cosmological constant also presented a compelling timeline. Back when the universe was smaller and denser, gravity was gradually slowing the expansion, and the cosmological constant didn’t have much effect. But as soon as the universe became big and diffuse enough, about six billion years ago, all that extra empty space meant that the tiny bit of stretching tendency could take over, causing the expansion to speed back up.

For the last few decades, every observation seemed to be in reasonable agreement with this narrative, so physicists integrated a cosmological constant into their model of how the universe works. The cosmological constant falls under the umbrella of the more generic term dark energy, which refers to anything that causes cosmic acceleration and encompasses the possibility of a cosmological constant or something even weirder.

By keeping the definition of dark energy broad, we’ve also kept an open mind for other explanations. Maybe dark energy isn’t an inherent property of space, but actually some kind of as-yet unknown energy field (sometimes called “quintessence” or “dynamical dark energy”). This field could be acting like a cosmological constant now—stretching space in just the same way—but instead of being a constant property of space, it might be something that changes with time, either growing weaker or stronger as the universe evolves.

Figuring out what exactly is happening with dark energy, and whether it really is a cosmological constant, has been the driving motivation forseveral major observational projectsin recent years, including DESI. Whatever dark energy is, by our best astrophysical accounting, it makes up something like 70 percent of the energy density of the universe. It’s the most important thing in the cosmos, both in terms of its amount and in terms of its influence on cosmic evolution.

If dark energy is a cosmological constant, the heat death scenario where the universe ends dark and cold and empty is virtually assured. We can calculate how long it will be before distant galaxies are pulled away from us so fast we can no longer see them (about 100 billion years), and we can determine how long it will be before the cosmos fully succumbs to its own inevitable decay (the number is too big to easily express in words).

Since DESI’s results have come out, though, people have been asking how that picture might change.

TheDESI resultsappear to agree better with a kind of dark energy that gets weaker over time than with a cosmological constant. The results are pretty compelling but not yet what we in physics would call a “discovery”. If the finding is correct, the expansion is still accelerating, but not as much as it was when dark energy first began to dominate. That’s definitely not how a cosmological constant works.

Some news stories about the results have suggested that this is reason for a certain kind of optimism. Maybe the heat death isn’t our fate after all. Perhaps the weakening of dark energy means that the expansion will enter a coasting phase, or eventually stop altogether. Some have even floated the idea that this evolving dark energy could weaken so much that it becomes an attractive force, reversing expansion completely and leading to a “big crunch”.

Personally, I would advocate quite a bit more caution in these interpretations. Even if DESI’s results completely hold up to scrutiny and are confirmed by other surveys, they give us essentially no information about the future. The only reason we can make inferences about our fate with a cosmological constant is that we know exactly how it behaves: It’s constant. With dynamical dark energy, though, until we know what drives its evolution, we have no handle on what will happen next.

Maybe we’ll get something else entirely. Taken at face value, the DESI results suggest that in an earlier epoch, dark energy was in what physicists call the “phantom” regime. Phantom dark energy is dark energy that gets more powerful over time in a way that can literally rip the universe apart. If it really was phantom in the past, there’s nothing to say it can’t shift that direction again, potentially leading to a rather ghastly fate called the “big rip.” On the theory side, there are reasons to doubt that phantom dark energy can happen at all, but if it can, it doesn’t exactly inspire optimism.

I should say that even if dark energy weakens so much that it disappears entirely, and even if expansion completely stops, that’s also not necessarily a reprieve. Stars will still explode or fade away as the hydrogen they contain is converted into helium in their cores. Black holes will grow and eventually evaporate. And one way or another the cosmos will tend toward disorder and decay, as some of our most reliable physical laws require. It’s also possible that an entirely different fate could befall us, driven by a quantum shift in the laws of physics: a weird and decidedly un-survivable phenomenon known as vacuum decay.

If dark energy really does go away, and if vacuum decay doesn’t happen, some slim prospects for keeping anything like life going in an expanding universe might theoretically exist, but I’d say they’re more technical than practical. There just isn’t a lot of room in our current understanding of cosmology for a happily-ever-after.

Personally, I’m excited to see how this debate develops, despite the bleak prognosis. DESI’s results could lead to the first major cosmological paradigm shift since dark energy was discovered, and a complete rewriting of our model of the universe.

Dark energy will probably destroy everything, eventually. But in the meantime, the quest to understand it has driven some incredible discoveries. And there’s no telling what the universe has in store for us next.

31,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/may-night-sky-events-stargazing-2025,"May’s night sky is packed with astronomical events—find out when and where to look for meteor showers, ancient star clusters, and a rare cosmic lineup.

May’s night sky is filled with entertainment for stargazers, whether you’re interested in observing planets, meteors, the moon, or even globular clusters. Grab your binoculars, set up your telescope, and get outside—here’s what to look for in the cosmos throughout the month.

Just after sunset, look to the west to spot a celestial “swarm.” The stars of the Beehive Cluster (Messier 44) will appear to buzz just below the crescent moon. Take a closer look, and you might notice one of the “bees” has a reddish hue—that’s Mars joining the fun.

(Here are fivefamous constellations that (almost) anyone can find.)

The Beehive cluster, located about 577 light-years away, contains more than a thousand stars. While some can be seen with the naked eye, the cluster’s dazzling display is best seen through binoculars or a telescope.

The Eta Aquariid meteor shower, active from April 20 to May 21, peaks on the night of May 5 into the morning of May 6. The shower is linked to Halley’s Comet, and observers can expect around 10 meteors per hour—potentially more if you’re in the Southern Hemisphere.

Though it might not be the most prolific show of the year, the Eta Aquarids are known for their super-fast meteors that leave glowing streaks across the night sky. These incandescent debris trails can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.

On May 6, Saturn experiences itsequinox—an event that happens only once every 15 Earth years. The sun shines directly over Saturn’s equator during this time, causing the planet’s famous rings to appear edge-on and nearly vanish from view.

The phenomenon offers a rare chance to see Saturn with its rings strikingly thin and faint, as sunlight hits them at a dramatic angle.

If you’ve never seen a globular cluster, you’ll soon have a good chance to look at one. Globular Cluster Messier 5 (M5) will be “well-placed” for observation on May 11, meaning it’s reached its highest point in the night sky.

Globular clusters are densely packed groups of gravitationally bound stars—tens of thousands to millions of them—that form a glittering spheroid shape. Located about 25,000 light-years away, M5 offers a glittering glimpse into theMilky Way’s early history. A telescope will reveal its dense core and halo of faint stars.

(Explore the galactic map that could guide aliens to Earth.)

See May’s “flower moon” reach full bloom on May 12. Per theFarmer’s Almanac, each month’s full moon often reflects natural events; in May, spring flowers are typically in bloom across North America.

As with April’s full moon, May’s full moon will be a micromoon that appears slightly smaller and dimmer than “normal” full moons. Micromoons occur when the moon reaches apogee, the point in its orbit farthest from Earth.

Looking for Saturn? On the night of May 22, the planet will be just 2°28’—or the distance of about 2.5 pinky fingers at arm’s length—away from the waning crescent moon. If you observe Saturn through a telescope, its rings will appear quite thin, thanks to the recent equinox.

That said, you won’t be able to fit both Saturn and the moon into the field of view of a telescope. If you want to see both simultaneously, you’ll have to do so with binoculars, though Saturn might not be well magnified.

Clear skies permitting, May 26 will offer some of the best stargazing conditions of the month. The new moon means no lunar light interfering with dark skies, providing optimal viewing for faint stars, galaxies, and nebulae.

If you don’t have your own optical gear, see if you can borrow binoculars from your local library or sync up with a local astronomy club for a stargazing session with telescopes.

(These are the world’s best stargazing spots.)

Don’t worry if you missed M5 on May 11—you have another chance to see a “well-placed” globular cluster on May 28. Messier 4 (M4) is the closest globular cluster to Earth at just 5,500 light-years away.

M4 has more than 100,000 stars, including an estimated 40,000white dwarfs. White dwarfs are ancient stars, or rather, the ultra-dense cores of ancient stars that have burned up all their fuel. They’re quite dim, so you won’t be able to see them without a reasonably high-powered telescope.

On May 31, Venus will reach its greatest western elongation—the maximum distance west of the sun in our sky. This places the bright “morning star” prominently in the pre-dawn hours.

Venus, the third-brightest object in the sky after the sun and moon, is easy to spot—and during greatest elongations, it’s especially striking.

32,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/faith-kipyegon-four-minute-mile-run-world-record,"The legendary runner is aiming to do something that sports scientists once considered impossible. We went inside her Kenyan training camp to understand how she’s pushing the limits of human performance.

Eldoret, Kenya —“Watch her,” says the man with the stopwatch, nodding toward the far end of the sun-cracked track. It’s a Saturday morning in March at the dilapidated stadium in the city of Eldoret, high above the Great Rift Valley in westernKenya. I follow the man’s gaze to where the greatest middle-distance runner of all time rounds the last turn, training for the impossible.

It’s hard to gauge the speed of 31-year-oldFaith Kipyegon. She is too smooth. Though she runs nearly at a sprint, her arms and legs slide forward and back with a liquid ease. Her face shows so little strain she might be a jogger out for a brisk trot around Central Park. Only her eyes betray her effort. They seem not to notice the spalling concrete of the never finished stadium, the weeds that grow in its grandstands, the chunk of missing track the size of a manhole cover in lane 4. Her gaze is turned downward, her thoughts focused on only what matters, which is to run faster.

Kipyegon is only 50 yards away from us now, the distance collapsing rapidly. Her longtime pacer, Bernard Soi, moves from his position in front of her. She presses the accelerator to unleash her ruthless kick, the final burst of speed that has carried her to an unprecedentedthree consecutive Olympic gold medalsin the 1,500 meters andfour world championships.

Today, though, Kipyegon isn’t training for titles. She’s working toward something closer to sporting immortality. In late June, she’ll try to do what no woman has done before: run a mile in less than four minutes.

Roger Bannister broke the quasi-mythical barrier in 1954. His run still stands as one of greatest physical feats in human history—the sport’s equivalent of the first summit of Mount Everest. Seventy-one years later, no woman has come close to doing the same.

To break four minutes, Kipyegon will have to drop nearly eight seconds fromthe current world record of 4:07.64—a record she holds. Shaving that much time in a distance where improvement is measured in hundredths of a second is, to say the least, incredibly difficult.

(Athletes are going faster, higher, and farther—thanks to technology and smarts)

Kipyegon will make her attempt on June 26 at Paris’s Stade Sébastien Charléty at an event put on by her sponsor, Nike. The exhibition has been dubbed Breaking4 and will be held on a closed course with a phalanx of pacers—factors that technically make it ineligible for ratification as a world record by the sport’s governing bodies. In many ways, Kipyegon’s attempt mirrors what fellow Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge did in 2019 when he becamethe first runner to break two hours in the marathon, a feat streamed live by 20 million people and later chronicled in adocumentary.

For Kipyegon, the motivations are many: she wants to break a barrier, of course. But she also wants to “cement her legacy,” she says, by creating a moment that transcends sport.She’s the mother of a six-year-old girl, and doing what others doubt can be done, she says, will “motivate young girls and young women around the world to push themselves in everything they do.”

As the inevitable media circus ramps up, and the eyes of the sporting world turn to one diminutive Kenyan runner, it’s hard not to wonder: How likely is this moon shot?

At most distances, women tend to run around 10 percent slower than men, saysThomas Haugen, an endurance sports researcher at Norway’s Kristiania University College. Since the men’s mile record currently sits at 3:43, that rule of thumb might put the next women’s record around 4:05.

Still,a recent studypublished in the journal Royal Society Open Science argued that it’s possible for Kipyegon, or an elite female athlete like her, to run a mile in 3:59.37.

The runner would needdrafting provided by a pacerexactly four feet in front of her and a second running exactly four feet behind her, the authors wrote, with fresh pacers swapping in halfway through the race. Drafting reduces aerodynamic drag, allowing an athlete to run faster without expending more energy. And the rear pacer pushes air into the back of the runner, propelling her ever so slightly forward, says Rodger Kram, one of the paper’s authors: “NASCAR racers know about [the effect].” Many variables could alter the outcome, the study acknowledged—from a slight wind (bad) to use of pacing lights on the track curbing (helpful).

(The brain has a secret survival trick to endure a marathon)

The simplicity of the mile masks its exquisite difficulty. It is too long to be a sprint but too short for a runner to hold much back. To be successful, “athletes need to develop both speed and endurance at the same time,” says Haugen, lead author of a 2021 study about the physiology and training for 800 meters and 1,500 meters. It’s a balancing act. “[I]f you emphasize endurance training too much, it may hamper your speed,” he explains. “Bottom line: Middle distance training is challenging because one type of training often is on the cost of other crucial performance attributes.”

When pursuing the unknown, though, the X factor often isn’t physiological—it’s mental. “The hardest thing to control is the mind,” says Kipchoge, who is still the only man to run under two hours in the marathon and has been Kipyegon’s mentor for a few years.

Kipchoge is confident that Kipyegon has the physical ability to break four minutes; she trains seven days a week and isa famously hard worker who never complains. He’s also sure of her inner toughness. Still, he knows from experience how doubt creeps into the head of even the best runner in the world when the body is pushed to its limit. Focus wanders. Confidence ebbs. “What will happen in the third lap?” he muses. “In the last 300 meters?” For Kipyegon to succeed her mind can’t flag for a moment.

How do you teach mental strength, though? “Faith to me is somebody who is so strong mentally that there’s not much I can work on,” saysPatrick Sang, Kipyegon’s coach. “The only thing is to stand by her side as a coach. And when she turns around, she sees that there is a shoulder to lean on.”

For her part, Kipyegon says her success in the last few years has given her a confidence that she didn’t always possess. “Since I break the world record in the 1,500 meters and the mile … everything is possible,” she says. “You know, impossible can be possible.”

Kipyegon is training for the attempt at a camp in Kaptagat, nearly 8,000 feet above sea level, among farms of maize and wheat. March is the planting season, and everywhere Kenya’s red earth has been turned over by the harrow to await the seed.

Two dozen of the world’s best male and female distance runners, primarily Kenyans, train year-round at the camp, which consists of about a collection of cinder block and stucco buildings beside a running track, with cows grazing on the infield. The buildings, blue with corrugated steel roofs, frame a leafy courtyard. Men share rooms in one dorm, women in another. In a nod to her elevated status, Kipyegon stays in her own small apartment in another building. The camp has a TV room with old curtains and a few inspirational books, and a dim dining room that serves ugali, the famed corn porridge that propels Kenyan runners. Young lime and pomegranate trees crowd the courtyard, each with a sign announcing the name of the visiting athlete who planted it. The metaphor is clear: Hard work takes time to bear fruit.

Kipyegon grew up in a small village about 140 miles west of Nairobi, the eighth of nine children in a family of athletes. She is from theKalenjin tribe, famed for producing runners. As a girl she and her siblings ran two and a half miles to school, home for lunch, and back again—10 miles a day—through eighth grade.

She first began to realize her gift for running when she was 14. Her PE teacher organized a brief footrace at school, and Kipyegon outran all her classmates. Just three years later, at 17, she’d won the junior race at the 2011 World Athletics Cross Country Championships—while running barefoot, the style she’d grown up with.

In 2018, Kipyegon stepped away from competition for 18 months to haveher daughter, Alyn. (She’s married to Timothy Kitum, the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist in the 800 meters.) Afterward she had difficulty running even 50 meters, she recalls, and thought her career was finished. Instead, she threw herself into training and the opposite happened. “I got stronger,” she says with a laugh. Motherhood “gives me energy. I have a girl who looks up to me. I have to push barriers, to show other young women that you can do everything.”

(Why the world's oldest sport is still one of the best exercises)

Over 50 days in 2023 she set three world records. In early June, in Italy, she set theworld record in the 1,500-meter race, running 3:49.11—the first woman ever to run under 3:50. One week later, in Paris, she set the thenworld record for the 5,000 meters. A few weeks after that, she obliterated the women’s world mile record, chopping more than four seconds from the mark. She finished off her season bywinning gold in both the 1,500 metersand the5,000 meters at the biennial world championships, the first woman to do so at the same championship. She was namedWorld Female Track Athlete of the Year. A sportswriter called it one of the great years in running history.

The Kaptagat camp where Kipyegon trains calls to mind a monastery. Like that track at Eldoret, its simplicity is not a deficiency but rather its essence, and its advantage: The quiet and spareness give a runner a place to train free of distraction. Almost anything that doesn’t contribute to running success is either discouraged or prohibited outright—including visits from family and friends. The world is reduced to what matters. The athletes run. Rest. Eat. Then they do it again.

Runners remain at camp all week, heading home only on weekends. “The idea of staying here for five days, six days and then you go, is to make you more focused, to make you concentrate more purely on your training,” says Kipchoge, who has trained at the camp for 22 years and is an architect of its milieu. Kipchoge sees no distinction between training to become a great runner and training to become a good human being, and everywhere around camp he has posted motivational signs. One reads: “Talent is not enough. You need Discipline. You need Dedication. You need Character.”

These are qualities Kipyegon has in spades. One morning after the athletes perform an hour of exercises on yoga mats in the courtyard to strengthen their core and back muscles, several runners sit in the yard in plastic chairs and rest, their legs spraddled before them. They speak in low tones so they don’t disturb the others who nap inside. Kipyegon, meanwhile, disappears to do some additional strength work. After the 2024 racing season, Kipyegontraveled toNike’s sports science lab in Beaverton, Oregon, to undergo a battery of tests. One highlighted a few muscle imbalances to address: “We want to make her hamstrings stronger,” says Eric Muthuri, the camp’s assistant physiotherapist. “That strength you can convert to speed.”

(Social running is all the rage—here’s why it’s good for you)

Another day, Kipyegon wakes up before dawn for her weekly long run on the rolling asphalt around Kaptagat. Though she’s a middle-distance runner, her weekly long run is still 20 miles. Mist clings to the low places. The morning smells of dung and turned earth and woodsmoke from kitchen fires. The two dozen runners in her group—almost all men—fill a lane of the road like a cycling peloton, sweeping around corners and over hills. Kipyegon tucks in near the front. Two schoolgirls briefly break into a run alongside her as she passes, a detail Kipyegon would like. As during the track workout, though, she is lost in concentration.

Running records tend to fall in a relatively predictable, linear fashion. And some academics have predicted that a woman might not break the four-minute barrier until at least 2033. After all, it took 34 years for the women’s record to drop by the nearly eight seconds that Kipyegon now hopes to shave off in just one run.

“I’ve learned my lesson from the sub‑two marathon attempt to never say never,” Steve Magness, a well-known coach and the author of The Science of Running, told the Guardian recently. “But we’re still too far out.” New shoe technology will help, Magness noted, and so will recent advances in athlete fueling: “But I don’t think it makes up that gap.”

Yet newspaper columns and scientific journals are littered with false prophecies that human athletic potential has reached its limit. Even the athletes themselves are often wrong. “It is a brick wall,” John Landy, the great Australian miler, said of the four-minute barrier, only weeks before Bannister ran his 3:59.4. Six weeks later,Landy himself smashed that mark, running 3:58 flat.

“The truth,” wrote sports biomechanist Ned Frederick in 1986, “is that we have no way of knowing of what we are capable.”

If Kipyegon doesn’t succeed in running sub-four in June but gets very close, it will be hard to consider the attempt a failure. As Magness told the Guardian, “When someone gets to 4:02-4:03, then it would be like ‘OK, we’ve got a shot.’”

And if she does break four minutes—will the record stand for a generation? Or will women runners pour in after her, having seen what’s possible, as men did in Bannister’s wake? Today more than 1,800 men have run the mile in under four minutes. As Bannister said, “Après moi, le déluge.”

When Kipchoge thinks of all the reverberations a record run by Kipyegon could have, he smiles. Yes, his friend’s success will change women’s running, he says. More than that, though, the feat will tell women everywhere that they can tackle whatever they want.“I’m trusting that it will change the world.”

33,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/article/lentils-peas-antioxidants-protein-superfoods,"Just like beans, peas and lentils are packed with protein and antioxidant compounds. Why don’t we eat more of them?

Beans hog the nutritional spotlight in the kitchen and onTikTok, but their fellow legumes lentils and peas pack high nutritional punches, too. These foods are so full of protein, fiber, and antioxidants that the American diet should be brimming with them, according toa recent reportby the U.S. government’s 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.

Various legumes are staples in Indian, Middle Eastern, and other cuisines but rare in classic American fare. “It is embarrassing how few legumes people eat in the U.S.,” saysChristopher Gardner, a nutrition scientist at Stanford University who helped author the new report. Even when people do eat them, he says, they lean towards the category’s most prominent member, beans.

(Black beans, pinto, and cannellini are also nutritionally rich.)

But some experts argue that lentils and peas deserve more of the limelight. In a 2022 review study, scientists at the University of Camerino in Italytermed lentils“one of the most important legumes.” That same year, thePhysicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a plant-food promoting medical group, called peas “the new power food.”

Here’s a look inside the plants’ nutritional and health benefits, how to handle them in the kitchen, and why they may be due for a rebrand.

Peas and lentils may seem like unrelated foods, but, like other members of the legume family—which additionally include soybeans, chickpeas, and peanuts—their commonality has less to do with how we eat them than with how they botanically behave.

All legumes form a mutually beneficial relationship withbacteria in their rootsthat enable them to pull nitrogen from the atmosphere into the ground, fueling the growth of both these plants and future plantings.

Americans eatroughly five poundsof peas and lentils combined per person each year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That’s less than the7.5 poundsof beans and a tiny fraction of the roughly60 poundseach for chicken and beef.

Because of their high protein content, they could easily be swapped for many meat meals. A half cup of cooked lentils provides about 12 grams of protein—roughly a fifthof the total daily needs of a sedentary, middle-aged woman.

(Want a better high-protein diet? You don’t have to eat more meat.)

Additionally, peas and lentils are low glycemic foods, “so they don’t tend to spike blood sugar,” saysAndres Ardisson Korat, a nutrition research scientist at Tufts University. In one small study, high-weight individuals at risk for diabetesreduced their insulin resistanceafter eating three cups of cooked lentils weekly for two months.

And they are bursting with phytochemicals, the antioxidants found in plantslinked to numerous health benefits, including preventing inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Studies connect lentil consumption to lower rates of heart disease, degenerative disorders, and aging, the Italian review found. Other reviews note theirantimicrobial activity.

Peas are similarly ripe with phytochemicals, especially flavonoids and phenolic acids. In addition to affording the same benefits as in lentils, mouse studies have found certain compounds in peasprotect against kidney disease.

Some social media influencersmalign lentils, peas, and other legumesfor generating toxic lectin compounds in the gut, but experts say the fear is unwarranted. Cooking high-lectin foods deactivates the chemicals. And unlike beans, lentils and peas are unlikely to cause digestive discomfort.

The most common variety of lentils found on supermarket shelves are brown ones, often used to make lentil soup. But specialty markets sell an array of lentils, including green, black, red, and yellow. Pea varieties include garden peas (also called English peas, the most common kind of shelling pea), split peas, and the snow peas and snap peas eaten with the pod. One of the advantages of these foods over beans is that you don’t need to soak them overnight before cooking.

Lentils are so versatile they can be cooked as fritters, pureed over vegetables, sprinkled on salads, or turned into a stew, saysAbra Berens, a renowned Michigan chef whose cookbookGrist: A Practical Guide to Cooking Grains, Beans, Seeds, and Legumessuggests boiling a big batch for 15 to 20 minutes early in the week and incorporating them into different dishes in the following days.

“People think of lentils are health foods they have to slog through, but if you play to their inherent texture, they can be this whole other thing,” Berens says. She especially likes the French variety of green lentils that hold their shape after cooking. She uses them instead of a grain side dish alongside seared duck breast to remake a classic Southern French recipe.

Lentils are a staple in Korat’s Mexican culture. He cooks red lentils in stews and mixes tiny black lentils into rice and other grains to add texture, flavor, and a pop of color.

Cooking peas varies depends on the type you’re using. Berens boils split peas (15 to 20 minutes) and presses them into the bottom of gluten-free “grain” bowls topped with vegetables and dips. She also fries split peas as fritters and tops them with sautéed greens and a fried egg. And of course, they’re used to make soup.

Sugar snap and snow peas are eaten in their immature pods (harvested before they fully ripen). Berens sautés snow peas in a “ripping hot pan” a couple of minutes a side until they’re blistered; she finishes the dish by drizzling on chili garlic oil.

When it comes to garden peas, people often love them or hate them. “Some people don’t like their strong pea flavor,” Korat says. And many overcook them, which yields the mushy texture that makes so many kids screw up their nose.

Victoria Moran, host of theMain Street Vegan Podcast, views garden peas as both a workhorse and a treat. “If it’s 6:30 p.m. and I haven't given dinner a moment's thought,” she says, she’ll create a quick, creamy soup by thawing frozen peas in hot water or vegetable broth and blending in raw cashews, water, salt and onion powder. (Experts say frozen peas, undoubtedly a time saver, retain most of the nutritional benefits of fresh peas.)

Moran saves fresh peas for special dishes. To remove them from the pod, she squeezes the seam between the thumb and forefinger, then pushes the individual peas into a waiting bowl. “I would never use these peas for soup. They took too much labor to come into the world,” she says. Instead, she’ll blanch them and add a handful as garnish to other dishes, such as cold gazpacho soup. “I want color contrast,” she says, “so somebody notices that I shelled peas.”

However cooks work lentils and peas into recipes, they and other legumes could get a more official rebrand in 2025.

The dietary advisory committee that Gardner served on with nearly two-dozen of the nation’s top nutrition experts is charged with counseling the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture before it updates to the country’sDietary Guidelines for Americanslater this year.

Though the agencies have the final say, the committee’s report recommends shifting legumes from their current categorization as vegetables to proteins—and placing it at the top of the list, ahead of nuts, seeds, and soy products and especially the more heavily consumed but higher-fat poultry and meats.

“People should be eating more plant-based proteins than they do,” saysKorat, whose research found consuming increased amounts of protein in midlife, especially from plants,leads to better physical and mental functioningin later years.

Because of their high protein levels, peas and lentils are an excellent option. Plus, Gardner points out, in the era of rising meat and egg prices, “they’re so inexpensive.”

34,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/article/how-to-improve-balance-as-you-age,"Your sense of balance fades after 40—but it doesn’t have to. Here’s how to maintain it.

If you can’t comfortably stand on one leg for 10 seconds, your body may be trying to tell you something. “Being able to stand on one leg is one of the most predictive measurements for aging,” saysClayton Skaggs, founder of the Central Institute for Human Performance (CIHP), the Karel Lewit Clinic, and Curious Gap Labs.

A 2024 Mayo Clinic studyfound that the ability to maintain balance standing on one leg indicates how well a person is aging more than strength or gait. Not only does it let us in on someone’s neuromuscular health, but it can also be a signal of other ailments.

“We utilize [balance] diagnostically to rule in or rule out other diseases,” saysParaminder Padgett, a neurological clinical specialist and physical therapy clinical supervisor at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center. “We know inactivity can lead to poor balance, but problems in the brain can also lead to poor balance. One of our jobs is to help tease that out.”

That’s because a wide range of chronic conditions—diabetes, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s,Alzheimer’s—can quietly erode your balance over time. Some affect nerves and proprioception, while others disrupt cognitive function and decision-making, all of which affect stability.

So while standing on one leg with your eyes closed might seem like a silly test, it’s actually a surprisingly comprehensive check-in. Balance is a complex, full-body symphony involving your eyes, ears, joints, muscles, and brain. Yet after age 40, these systems slowly decline due to the sedentary lifestyle many Americans ease into.

The result? A gradual loss of stability that can have serious consequences down the line: falls, fractures, and a shrinking world as people avoid movement they no longer trust. In 2021 alone, accidental fallscaused 38,000 deathsamong Americans over age 65. But here’s the hopeful part: it doesn’t have to be that way.

Good balance depends on the integration of our vision, somatosensory system (responsible for the sensory information of touch from our muscles, joints, skin, and fascia), and vestibular system within our ears. When any of these systems start to slip, your sense of equilibrium can go with it.

“Just like we have wrinkles on the outside of your body, you have wrinkles on the inside,” Padgett says. “If you use it right, the systems in the brain will continue to adapt to that degradation.”

In other words, use it or lose it. However, Skaggs says we don’t necessarily need to expect these systems to dwindle as we reach the magic age of 40. “These concepts of variation are misinterpreted relative to folks just not taking care of their health,” he says. While some physical decline is natural—like changes in muscle mass, joint mobility, or sensory precision—what we think of as “normal aging” is often a reflection of long-term neglect.

(This one muscle could be the key to fixing your back pain.)

“When someone is trying to get out of a chair and starts to notice that they can’t do that without using their hands, then that internal model will cause them to keep using their hands,” Skaggs says. “It will become their new way of getting out of the chair, leading to more weakness and less ability to use their legs to get out of their chair.” These accommodations and precautions within these movements expedite their loss.

The good news is that balance isn’t a fixed trait. It can be trained, rebuilt, and maintained at any age—if you keep your body moving and your brain engaged.

“We are designed for our trunk balancing efforts. Your core should be dominating as a point of stability, for standing on one leg, for getting up and off the toilet or reaching down to get something in your kitchen,” Skaggs says. “When it’s not, your upper back, your hamstrings, your pectoral muscles start jumping in to help you do these simple things.” That starts becoming the pattern, and your proximal stability systems wane.

For many,your 50sis when movement starts to decline. “I hear a lot of ‘Well, I worked all my life. I retired. It’s okay to sit in my recliner and watch TV all that.’ Or, ‘I do crossword puzzles. I’m keeping my mind active,’” Padgett says. It’s not enough. Movement is essential.

(Do crossword puzzles really keep your brain sharp?)

She works on what they call “dual tasking”—patients doing a physical activity and cognitive challenge simultaneously – to nurture their balance. For example, she says walking and naming fruits, starting with the letter A, and getting through the alphabet.

Variety in movements is also necessary as we age, especially for the vestibular system. “The ear canals are oriented in a way to help your brain know where your head is in space, to know what upright is and if you are upright,” Padgett explains. She points to yoga and offers downward dog and other poses where your head is down. “Your brain has to deal with and assimilate that information to know which way is upright.”

Activities that involve unpredictability or play—like juggling, hiking, or tossing a frisbee—are particularly useful. “You’re introducing complexity, and the more complex you get, the more you need to react,” Padgett says. “You’re working on your reactive balance.”

(Here’s howwalking barefoot can actually help your feet.)

Even going barefoot can help. “The sensory information that comes through when you’re barefoot is a lot more pronounced and beneficial. Your foot mobility is going to be more engaged when you’re barefoot.” Small changes can wake up underused systems, whether you’re standing on a foam pad, walking on an unpaved path, or simply closing your eyes during a balance drill.

Most importantly, find movement you enjoy. “I certainly do not enjoy all the exercise that I do, but I always feel good when I’m done. I know that it’s good for me and allows me to do the things that I want to do, mostly pain free,” she says.

Research supportswhat these experts see daily: systemic balance training improves physical function and may also boost memory and spatial awareness. “The most important thing to do is to move and to move as much as possible,” Padgett says. “So, you have to find something that’s enjoyable for you.”

35,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/article/human-flourishing-mental-health,"Scientists say ""flourishing"" is a better framework for living a fulfilling life. A huge new global study reveals who is actually flourishing—and who is languishing behind.

What really makes for a fulfilling life? This question has been onTyler J. VanderWeele’s mind for decades.

In his first faculty job as a biostatistician at the University of Chicago, he was dissatisfied with how scientists defined and measured human well-being.There were plenty of studies on specific measures of clinical symptoms, like depression, or emotional states like happiness or anxiety. Researchers had tracked objective markers of health, like blood pressure or sleep quality as well as how economic conditions influence health.

But while these measures captured specific slices of both the problems and joys of life, VanderWeele felt they missed a holistic picture of what humans really seek, especially the need for meaning and purpose in life.

Since that first job, his team has developed a more rounded way to measure how people are doing – mentally, physically, and spiritually. They call it “flourishing.”

“Flourishing itself might be understood as a state in which all aspects of a person’s life are good,” he wrote in aninfluential 2017 papertitled “On the promotion of human flourishing.” He and his team have since expanded that definition to include the context, communities, and environments in which a person lives.

Flourishing is a helpful concept because there are different ways to achieve it. Not every measurable element of a person’s life must be perfect to flourish. It also recognizes what matters to people — what gives meaning and purpose to their lives — must resonate with their deepest values.

In the years since that initial insight, VanderWeele, now a Harvard professor, has worked closed with Baylor University’sByron R. Johnson,to create a scientifically calibrated measure of flourishing in order to study it more deeply. Five years ago, in partnership withGallupand theCenter for Open Science, they embarked on an ambitiousfive-year study of over 200,000 participants from 22 countries to find out what causes a person to flourish.

Its latest results, just out today in the journalNature Mental Health, are raising some provocative and disturbing questions about how people are doing around the world.

A key takeaway? Community is crucial. ”What we sometimes get wrong, especially in the West and perhaps especially in American culture, is the notion that complete autonomy will really help us to flourish,” VenderWeele says. What we really need more of is one another.

“The Global Flourishing Study reveals fascinating insights into the key question of what make a life well lived,” saysIan Goldin,a development economist at Oxford who was not involved in the study, but reviewed it prior to publication. “It is the choices we make, as individuals and communities, not our material possessions or virtual engagements, that give us deep satisfaction and a feeling of well-being.”

The goal of theGlobal Flourishing Studyis to gauge how individuals from different countries have flourished over five years, based on participants’ annual answers to a number ofquestions about their lives– ranging from “I understand my purpose in life” to “how would you rate your physical health” to “how often do you worry about being able to meet normal monthly living expenses?”

The GFS focuses on six key areas: happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, close social relationships, and financial and material security. Answers to questions in each area tallied up to get a snapshot of how well a person is doing.

Findings from the second wave of data released April 30 show that, in general, people between the ages of 18 to 29 are not flourishing. “The most concerning thing [to me] is that young people in many countries are not doing well,” says VanderWeele. “This has real implications for policy and raises questions about the extent to which we're prioritizing the well-being of youth and investing in in them.”

(What is brain fog? Here's what scientists are finding out.)

The conventional wisdom among those who study wellbeing is that people’s satisfaction with their lives tends to form a U-shaped curve: higher in youth and old age, and lower in the middle years. The latest results suggest the shape of that experience may be flattening through age 18 to 49 and then increasing after that. “The youngest people are reporting the lowest levels of flourishing,” VanderWeele says. “It’s not the case universally… but it’s the case in Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom.” (Notably: it’s not the case in Poland and Tanzania.)

So, what’s changed? There are many potential causes.Social scientists suggest that young people are struggling over issues of the cost of living, fallout from the pandemic, uncertainties over work in the future, and a general fraying of social institutions such as religion and government in many parts of the world.

Other studies are also ringing similar alarm bells over the struggles of younger people. TheWorld Happiness Report, which reported its 2025 results in March and is also based on Gallup poll data, found that younger people are in distress. In 2023, 19 percent of young adults across the world reported they had no one they could count on for social support – a 39 percent increase compared to 2006.

Brandon Kwok, 24, who grew up in Singapore, began struggling with anxiety attacks at 14 and now openly discusses the challenges he’s faced in avoiding social isolation and, instead, seeking out social interactions with friends by participating in sports teams and volunteering as a bartender at college. “The biggest thing that’s affecting my generation is anxiety,” he said. “Nobody’s got a playbook” for dealing with it.

One of the Flourishing Study’s research team’s most provocative findings is that meaning in life and flourishing seems to be inversely correlated with a country’sGDP (gross domestic product) per capita. “While the richer more developed countries do report higher on things like financial security … they don’t report as high on meaning, on relationships, on pro-social character,” VenderWeele says, emphasizing that was a big surprise in the data.

“Third world countries consistently outperform those in the First World in meaning and purpose,” says Baylor’s Johnson. “You would expect the U.S. to be at the top and that’s not the case. It’s not about GDP.”

More follow-up is needed. “The data do not provide evidence that increased prosperitycausesdeclines in flourishing,” saysEranda Jayawickreme, a psychology professor at Wake Forest University, who was not involved in the current research.

At least not yet. This ongoing project is doing something that most previous studies of flourishing have not. It is tracking people’s responses to the survey over a period of years (versus gauging them at one single point of time), which may eventually help researchers draw conclusions about causality. “It will be interesting to see if this evidence holds across subsequent waves of this study.” (Also to note: While the study looked at some very rich countries, and some less wealthy ones, the very poorest countries in the world were not included. It’s hard to know where they’d fit in the flourishing rankings.)

At the top of the Global Flourishing Study’s ranking is Indonesia, a predominantly Muslim country which has the highest average scores in many aspects of flourishing among the initial 22 countries. Its average flourishing score is 8.47, compared to the U.S.’s 7.18. It’s also muchless wealthy than the US.

Why are people flourishing there? “Indonesia is an island country that has always been incredibly diverse in ethnicity, language, culture, and religion,” notes Johnson. “Like any country, it has conflicts, but the country really does work hard to stress harmony.” One possible explanation for that: the country’s traditional village and tribal structures have a history of seeking peaceful relations, including those with different faiths.

“In places where there are real economic struggles, there is still a deep sense of social orientation and a sense of meaning,” said VanderWeele, “and I think these things have been neglected in the West to some extent.”

(Can religion make you happy? Scientistsmaysoon find out.)

Alberta Christina C. Pertiwi, 28, who helps direct undergraduate programs at the Universitas Indonesia and lectures in its Anthropology Department, has the perspective of someone who’s lived in New York, as a student at Columbia University, and now in Jakarta, Indonesia, where she was born and raised.

Pertiwi’s experience in Indonesia has been that her students remain hopeful, perhaps because they live in a country with strong social cohesion. “It’s a culture of family togetherness, collectivism, that is manifested through eating together and hanging out.”

While Indonesia, with a GDP per capita of $5,250 in 2025, came out on top in flourishing, the U.S., with a per capita GDP of $89,680, was ranked in the bottom third.

Japan, with a GDP of $35,600, was dead last. Likewise, in this year’s World Happiness Report, Japan’s rank was 55th– just below Uzbekistan’s, a country with about one-tenth of Japan’s GDP.Taken together, this suggests the country is experiencing a lot of social strain.

“Japan represents a cautionary tale about the risks of very rapid economic development,” says Brendan Case, Associate Director for Research at Harvard’s Human Flourishing Program, who worked closely with the report’s data. He noted Japan’s ongoing debates about its falling birth rates, challenges of family formation, the large numbers of men who are socially isolated, and low levels of religious observance as potentially contributing to its citizens’ (lack of) flourishing. “It seems plausible to wonder whether the rapid pace of economic and cultural transformation that overtook Japan in the last 150 years came at a relatively high cost in many areas of flourishing.”

Insights on flourishing are urgently needed now – and not just for members of Gen Z like Kwok. Measures of social isolation, loneliness, anxiety, and other anti-social trends are soaring. What’s causing all this languishing, and can we fight back?

We don’t yet have answers to these big societal questions. But as individuals, we can all work towards flourishing. And VanderWeele’s interdisciplinary group at Harvard hopes to spread the message that small changes can help. Its recommendations? Participating in group activities – from bowling leagues and volunteering at a food bank to joining faith communities – can help us do better by increasing our sense of social connection.

People who attendweekly religious servicestend to score higher on flourishing. But secular community events can make a big impact too. Consider Claire Parker, a retired British oncologist, who has faced some serious challenges over the years. At 28, she lost a leg to cancer. At 55, she ended a long marriage.

Dr. Parker, now 64, says she flourishes despite her disability because she’s sought out ways to get involved in different communities, including volunteering with theFalcon Boat Club, a nonprofit organization that has supported her and other local water sports enthusiasts since 1869. She also volunteers at schools and started a new beekeeping hobby. “It feels more balanced in my life to be a volunteer,” she noted, noting it all has been “very beneficial to my well-being.”

Volunteering and community involvement are powerful forms of social connection. So is eating with others, which turns out to be a strong predictor of happiness.Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, director of Oxford University’s Wellbeing Research Centre and a co-editor of this year’sWorld Happiness Report, notes that in 2023, about 1 in 4 Americans reported eating all their meals alone on the previous day – an increase of 53 percent since 2003. He notes dining alone has risen significantly in East Asian countries, notably Korea and Japan where the people surveyed reported sharing just one to two dinners per week. This may be because of the intense work cultures of these countries.

Spending more time with other people at meals and elsewhere and stepping back to reflect on who we are and how we become better versions of ourselves, can help us flourish. But the reality is that, in many places around the world, modern-day economic and social pressures get in the way.

Kwok, the 24-year-old from Singapore, has turned to Aristotle in thinking about how to flourish in his life. He is in his final undergraduate year at Oxford studying philosophy, politics, and economics. He’s already got a job lined up for himself in London after he graduates. But his new job will make it harder for him to see his grandmother in Singapore. “It kind of stings a bit,” he admitted.

Drawing from his studies of Aristotle, he believes that to flourish, he should meaningfully challenge himself – even if that means taking on a challenge far away from home and family. Finding that balance, especially for young people around the world, has not been easy.

But flourishing is a process, rather than a static condition, as the study’s scientists note. It is not something we can ever perfectly achieve. There’s always another chance to get the balance right.

36,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/deinosuchus-croc-crocodile-dinosaurs-north-america,"The prehistoric crocodile relative may have tolerated both freshwater and saltwater habitats, allowing it to conquer North American coasts in the Cretaceous.

Around 75 million years ago, North America’s largest and most formidable carnivore was not a dinosaur—but a croc.Deinosuchus, the “terrible crocodile” in Greek, could reach more than 35 feet in length and weigh over five tons.Bite marks on bonesleave no doubt that the immense reptile caught and ate dinosaurs. HowDeinosuchusbecame such a large and widespread predator, however, has been a mystery.

Now, a new study published today inCommunicationsBiologyclaims to have solved the puzzle—by shifting whereDeinosuchusfits in the croc family tree and, potentially, how tolerant the reptiles were of salty habitats. “We wanted to better understand howDeinosuchusbecame this successful top predator of coastal wetlands all over North America, why it grew so large,” saysMárton Rabi, a paleontologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany and a coauthor on the paper.

Paleontologists have been on the trail ofDeinosuchussince a pair of fossilized teeth were found in North Carolina in 1858. Since that time the reptile’s fossilized teeth, bony armor, skull pieces, and skeletal parts have been found in Mexico, Utah, Texas, Montana, South Carolia, New Jersey, and more, popping up along the edges of North America’s prehistoric coastlines in rocks 82 to 72 million years old. In the lowland marshes and swamps of Cretaceous North America,Deinosuchuswatched and waited for prey to get close enough to bite.

Paleontologists categorized thethree knownDeinosuchusspecies as alligatoroids, the broad group that contains theAmerican alligatorand Chinese alligator today. The broad, rounded snout ofDeinosuchuscertainly carried a resemblance to alligators more than other crocodilians, the reptile group that includes both crocodiles, alligators, and their relatives, hinting at a close relationship.

After running a new comparison of family relationships, the researchers have questioned the traditional view and recategorized the massive reptile. Instead, the study suggests,Deinosuchusbelonged to an ancient lineage that split off before the last common ancestor of today’s alligators and crocodiles, carrying characteristics that are seen in both groups. This allowed the ancient croc to thrive among saltier habitats like estuaries and ocean coasts like saltwater crocodiles do today.

“We were surprised to find out thatDeinosuchuswas not a ‘greater alligator,’” Rabi says. The team argues that the reptile’s alligator-like appearance was likely a matter of convergent evolution rather than a family resemblance.

New York Institute of Technology paleontologistAdam Cossette, who was not involved in the new study, questions some of the methodologies used to construct the new family tree but notes that the new placement makes sense asDeinosuchusfossils show an array of traits seen in alligators and crocodiles, as well as some features “usually found very deep in the tree.”

Rabi and coauthors wondered if the new classification could explain howDeinosuchuscame to live in freshwater and saltwater habitats as geographically distant as Mexico and New Jersey. Alligators tend to prefer freshwater habitats, while many crocodiles are more tolerant of salt water. The researchers argue thatDeinosuchuswas more like a saltwater crocodile than an American alligator and, in addition to following coastal habitats, swam across a prehistoric sea that divided North America in two halves during the late Cretaceous.

Other researchers are skeptical of the argument, however. “I disagree with species ofDeinosuchusbeing saltwater tolerant,” Cossette says, noting thatDeinosuchusfound in Texas, for example, lived in freshwater environments that were not especially close to the coast.Deinosuchusfossils in Utah, as well, are found with freshwater fish and reptiles in habitats that were not especially close to the coast. It may be thatDeinosuchuspreferred freshwater but was capable of foraging in and traversing saltier waters when necessary.

“The abundance ofDeinosuchusfossils in coastal deposits is a reflection only of the conditions for preservation,” adds University of Bristol paleontologistMax Stockdale, who was not involved in the new study. The shoreline is only part of the picture.Deinosuchusmay have lived in environments not recorded in the fossil record. Additionally, Stockdale notes, freshwater species like Nile crocodiles and American alligators have been known to swim between ocean islands or spend time at sea, so the case forDeinosuchusremains inconclusive based on available evidence.

Even as paleontologists still the particulars ofDeinosuchusbiology, there is no doubt that the predator was big. The fossils ofDeinosuchusare often found in the same formations as the carnivorous tyrannosaurs, for example, butDeinosuchuscould grow to be longer and more massive than the tyrant dinosaurs, making it a true apex predator. The croc even hada bite force greater thanT. rex, though the two didn’t coexist. In order forDeinosuchusto thrive, there had to be plenty of food. The broad range of the carnivore indicates that there was a great deal of suitable habitat to support such a gargantuan meat-eater.

“You need two things for growing giant crocs,” Rabi says, which are a fast growth rate early in life and a consistent food supply to fuel that rapid growth. During the late Cretaceous, whenDeinosuchuslived, high global sea levels and a warm climate fed incredible growth within marshes and swamps everywhere the sea touched North America. The nature of these aquatic ecosystems, the new study proposes, allowed such giant reptiles to evolve in the first place.

“The high-productivity wetlands, including prey species, were critical for the evolution ofDeinosuchus,” Rabi says, a pattern that is seen among other giant, prehistoric crocs such asSarcosuchusthat lived in ancient Africa and South America about 120 million years ago and the broad-snoutedPurussaurusof South America between 16 and 5 million years ago.

Food wasn’t the only factor for giant, cold-blooded crocs. “The gigantism we see inDeinosuchusis a reflection of stability in the environment,” Stockdale cautions, especially asDeinosuchuswould have relied on the temperature of its environment to regulate its body temperature. Conditions had to be just right for a long time to allow such a croc to evolve. Such ecosystems have evolved several times over in Earth’s history, fueling the growth of giants likeDeinosuchus. Perhaps someday they will again.

37,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/alien-planet-signs-life-biosignature-exoplanet,"A team of astronomers claims to have sniffed out a “biosignature” in the atmosphere of a distant planet called K2-18b. But not everyone agrees that it signals life.

In 2020, scientists claimed to have founda sign of life on Venus: hints of a stinky gas called phosphine that’s made by microbes on Earth. The claim wasswiftly challengedand, years later, is still mired in controversy. Now, another stinky gas has sparked its own alien life debate—this time, for an exoplanet.

Researchers announced on April 16 that they’d used data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) todetect a gas called dimethyl sulfide(DMS) in the atmosphere of an exoplanet called K2-18b, which orbits in its alien star’s habitable zone. On Earth, DMS is mostly made by microscopic phytoplankton. On other planets, it could be what’s called a biosignature—a sign of life.

Cambridge University, which hosts several of the researchers involved in the detection, wasquick to promote the findingas the “strongest hints yet of biological activity outside the solar system.” Some media outlets trumpeted the DMS as a likely sign of life. But scientists who weren’t involved in the discovery aren’t as euphoric.

“I'm pretty skeptical of this claim, and I wish the press coverage better reflected the skepticism of the astronomical and astrobiological community,” wrote astrobiologistJoshua Krissansen-Tottonof the University of Washington in an email.

ForClara Sousa-Silva, an astrochemist at Bard College who was involved in the 2020 Venus biosignature debacle, the situation is disappointingly familiar. “We did not learn enough from the ‘phosphine on Venus’ drama,” she says.

National Geographicgot in touch with ten independent experts to find out what to make of this biosignature claim. (Not all are quoted below, but their views are represented.) The takeaway: It’s an exciting discovery, perhaps even an important step on the way to discovering alien life one day. Emphasis on “one day.” We didnotjust find aliens.

Here’s what you need to know about DMS on K2-18b.

If you follow exoplanet news, you might be feeling a bit of déjà vu. In 2023, the same research team led by Cambridge astrophysicistNikku Madhusudhanpublished JWST observationshinting at DMS on K2-18b.

Based on the same JWST data, the researchers also concluded that K2-18b was a type of habitable planet called a“Hycean” world.Madhusudhan and his colleaguescoined the termin 2021 to describe a group of hypothetical planets bigger than Earth, smaller than Neptune, mostly made of water, and wreathed in thick veils of hydrogen and helium. Under the right conditions, they could have temperate surface oceans hospitable for life.

The DMS detection from 2023 fell short of the typical statistical standards for discoveries in astronomy. Thisnew study, published in theAstrophysical Journal Letters,is a follow-up using an instrument on JWST that’s sensitive to light at different wavelengths than the original study.

While the last DMS detection was weaker than tentative, this one appears to be much stronger. Madhusudhan and his colleagues claim that their detection of DMS (and/or a similar molecule called dimethyl disulfide or DMDS) reaches a “three sigma” level of significance. That’s statistical jargon meaning there’s less than a 0.3 percent chance that the DMS detection was made by chance—still lower than the gold standard five sigma cutoff for statistical significance, but far more convincing than before.

“Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have,” Madhusudhan said in Cambridge’spress release.

Other scientists aren’t as sanguine. Some are skeptical that the DMS (or DMDS) is even there at all.

“It's really interesting, a great showcase of the capabilities of JWST,” astronomerLaura Kreidbergof the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy said in a voice memo. “But, yeah, I wouldn't bet my house on it.”

Scientists can use JWST to identify gases in exoplanet atmospheres via chemical fingerprints in starlight that has filtered through the planets’ atmospheres. Those chemical fingerprints show up as wiggles in graphs of the starlight’s intensity versus its wavelength. The new study tried to match these spectral wiggles to 20 molecules. That’s “more molecules than astronomers often do, it’s just astronomers don't often claim aliens,” says Sousa-Silva. Most of those molecules aren’t structurally similar to DMS and DMDS, either, she notes, so it wasn’t exactly a targeted screen of possible false-positives.

Another researcher, astronomerRyan MacDonaldat the University of Michigan went further,criticizing the three sigma claim as “statistical hacking”on Bluesky.

Kreidberg is more forgiving. “I think that the discovery team did a great job, really careful work with the data. But as someone in this business myself, I can say that it is just really hard.”

Already, researchers have formally challenged thebiosignature claim. In apreliminary studyposted to arXiv.org on April 22, astrophysicistJake Taylorof the University of Oxford found no strong evidence for DMS and/or DMDS in the new JWST data.

ThoughK2-18borbits in its star’s habitable zone, it is not a second Earth. At 2.6 times the radius and 8.6 times the mass of our planet, it is a mysterious and alien world—one that might not even be habitable.

When an independent team recently reanalyzed the Cambridge team’s 2023 observations of K2-18b, they foundno evidence of DMS, nor of carbon dioxide—a blow to the Hycean world scenario, which predicted plenty of carbon dioxide. An earlierstudyclaimed that K2-18b is most likelyan inhospitable gassy ball with no surface whatsoever.Another team has suggested aneven less hospitable alternative: The planet could have an ocean not of water, but of magma.

Madhusudhan points out that the analysis reporting no carbon dioxide on K2-18b has not yet been peer-reviewed. “There are open questions, but they don't preclude habitability,” he says. “The evidence for CO2is certainly there.”

Even if K2-18b is a Hycean world, that doesn’t mean it is habitable. Without a reflective deck of clouds, the planet’s ocean would broil beneath its hydrogen blanket. That’s the likely fate of any ocean that might exist on K2-18b, at least according toa study posted last week.

“The simplestexplanation of this planet is a very thick gas-giant atmosphere with no habitable surface,” says exoplanet scientistNick Woganof NASA Ames. “There are so many challenges with making a habitable (or inhabited) K2-18b work.”

Still, let’s say scientists confirm the DMS signal, and K2-18b turns out to be a habitable Hycean world. You still might want to hold off on popping the “we found aliens” champagne.

Until scientists can rule out abiotic explanations—ones that don’t involve living things—for DMS and/or DMDS, these gases won’t be true biosignatures for K2-18b. And asHarrison Smith, an astrobiologist at the Earth-Life Science Institute in Japan, and his colleagueCole Mathisat Arizona State University argued in a 2023 essay,ruling out false positives for exoplanets is very hard.

“At least Venus is a planet we know. We know what it looks like, and what the environment is like,” says Sousa-Silva.Without knowing what K2-18b’s geochemistry and atmosphere are really like, scientists can’t confidently exclude the possibility that alien chemistry, not alien life, is the source of the DMS.

And we already know that nature can produce DMS without life. Last year, chemistNora Hänniat the University of Bern and her colleaguesfound DMS on comet 67P—not exactly a habitable world. Other researchers havefound it in interstellar space. And last year, chemistEleanor Browneof the University of Colorado, Boulder and her colleagues showed that DMS can be producedin light-fueled chemical reactionsin lab experiments with synthetic atmospheres.

“There's no reason to understand [DMS] as a unique consequence of life,” says Mathis. “I just, for the life of me, cannot figure out exactly what the argument is about: why they think this could even potentially be indicative of life, given that we've seen abiotic sources.”

The study authors acknowledge some of these challenges. Madhusudhan says that neither comets nor interstellar material are feasible sources of the high concentrations of DMS and DMDS his team detected. But finding DMS in unexpected, dead environments shows that we still have a lot to learn about how it forms.

Other uncertainties haunt the detection. We don’t know how life began on Earth, so we can’t know if conditions on K2-18b —even if they’d be hospitable for earthlings — could have got life started in the first place. And even if life did evolve there, who’s to say that it’d produce DMS —and if it does produce DMS, why haven’t scientists spotted other biosignature gases?

Still, despite its many, many caveats, most researchers we spoke with agree that there’s reason to celebrate this new study of K2-18b. “It's really an achievement. Thirty years ago, we didn't even know that there are exoplanets,” says Hänni.

Peter Vickers, a philosopher of science at Durham University who’s studied life detection claims, was initially skeptical. “But then the more I looked at it, the more I thought that it actually is quite significant and shouldn't be underplayed either,” he says.

For Madhusudhan’s part, he doesn’t think caution and excitement are mutually exclusive. Even a sliver of evidence for alien life is a “transformational achievement” he says, but there’s a big step from there to a true life detection claim. “We need to recognize both: the achievement and the caution.”

If we do ever find life beyond our solar system, it won’t happen all at once. We’ll slide slowly into certainty, pushed along by findings like this one—hints that there’s something more to discover if only we’d look closer. And this result is, without a doubt, an invitation to look closer at K2-18b. If we find life there, on one of the first potentially habitable planets we’ve inspected closely, says Vickers, we’ll have to assume life is common everywhere; if life is rare, the odds of just stumbling upon the right planet are astronomically low.

“We're still only at the question asking stage, but it's amazing that we can ask this question,” says astrobiologistMichael Wongof Carnegie Science. “What a lucky time to be alive.”

38,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/article/ovarian-aging-delay-menopause,"Clinical trials are underway that demand us to rethink menopause—and whether or not women actually need to go through it.

""We don't have to accept menopause as destiny,” saysKutluk Oktay, an ovarian biologist and director of the Yale School of Medicine and Director of Laboratory of Molecular Reproduction and Fertility Preservation. Oktay, a leading researcher in fertility preservation, is one of the many scientists in the race to end menopause as we currently understand it.

For most women, menopause means a gradual decline of progesterone and estrogen beginning in their mid-40s. The menopausal transition, or perimenopause, can last between two and eight years, and even up to a decade, before menopause, the point at which a woman’s menstrual period has stopped for a year. During perimenopause, women can experience a range of associated symptoms, includinghot flashesto night sweats, pain during sex, joint pain, and mood and cognitive effects. Though hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can mitigate some of the effects, many of the physical impacts of menopause are lifelong health risks that can’t be treated with HRT, including bone density loss and a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

But what if that timeline wasn’t inevitable? What if women were able to delay the onset of menopause or, more provocatively, end it all together? Medical researchers are tackling those questions, exploring drug therapy and other treatments that will, if successful, result in significantly delaying the onset of menopause.

“I think it’s long overdue,” saysZev Williams, director of the Columbia University Fertility Center, who is currently studying how to delay ovarian aging. “For too long, menopause [has been] treated as an inevitability rather than a modifiable health event.”

Oktay agrees, comparing menopause to other natural aging processes that can be corrected, like getting eyeglasses for vision loss. “Up until now everybody said, ‘Well, menopause is a given, it's a natural process’,” Oktay says. “We have a lot of natural [processes for which] we are intervening.”

​​​​Williams’ and Oktay’s teams aren’t the only researchers examining the possibility of extending​ovarian longevity. Researchers​at the startup Gameto are currently animal testing engineered​young ovarian support cells from stem cells with the hopes of slowing menopause. And biotech firm Celmatix is working on a drug that they hope will slow ovarian reserve depletion. Other projects involve senolytics, a class of medicines designed to selectively remove old, damaged cells that contribute to inflammation and disease; and there are additional studies on​compounds that boost cellular energy production​​​​​, and some researchers are investigating stem cell therapy to regenerate ovarian tissue.​​​​​​

Though much of this research is still in the development phase,​new clinical trials are accelerating,​​​​​finally giving menopause the scientific attention it deserves. “This field is still in its early stages, but with continued scientific investment, we may soon reach a point where delaying menopause is a real, accessible option,” Williams says. This, he says, could have profound implications: “By rethinking ovarian aging, we have an opportunity to reshape how we approach aging in general.”

As researchers race towards finding medical interventions to delay or, eventually, end menopause, their work demands a reassessment of our current perception of women’s bodies and the inescapable, and rapid, march of ovarian aging. What does it mean to potentially expand women’s fertile years? And, perhaps most intriguingly: Do women need to go through menopause at all?

Menopause is a bit of a scientific black box. Scientists aren’t exactly sure why women even go through menopause or the purpose it serves. “Humans are one of only a few species, along with some whales, that experience menopause,” Williams says. While many female mammals remain fertile for most of their lifespan, humans lose fertility decades before other systems show signs of aging.

“In many species, fertility gradually declines but doesn’t cease entirely until very late in life, if at all,” Williams points out. In addition, women lose eggs each month through a natural selection process called atresia, where multiple follicles are recruited but only one matures. That inefficiency is present in many other mammals, but because humans have such a long lifespan relative to our reproductive window, the consequences of ovarian aging are especially pronounced in our species.

There are a few theories as to why women experience menopause. One, Williams points out, is the grandmother hypothesis, which theorizes that menopause evolved so that women would stop reproducing and instead invest their energy in supporting their grandchildren, increasing the​ir​survival​​​​. Others think that menopause protects women from the risks of late-age pregnancy, a threat to both the longevity of women and their offspring.

It’s possible, however, that menopause isn't an evolutionary feature at all: “The onset of menopause may just be a reflection of our longer lifespan​,” Williams says​.​​When the average lifespan was under 50 years, the​end​of ovulation and ovarian function would not have been a factor​, he adds.​​​The average American woman nowlivesuntil she’s 80 years old, meaning she will spend roughly 25 years postmenopausal, significantly longer than, for example, her great-grandmother. A woman bornin 1900had an average lifespan of 48 years.

Scientists do know one thing: menopause is the direct consequence of ovarian aging—which is also the key to delaying it. “Unlike other organs, the ovaries experience accelerated aging, with a dramatic decline in function beginning in a woman’s 30s,” Williams explains. It follows then, that if medical advancements can slow ovarian aging, it may be the key to extending the reproductive and hormonal lifespan of the ovaries, delaying​​menopause while potentially reducing the health risks associated with it. Researchers point to women who naturally start menopause later, after the age of 55—which occurs in about 10 percent of women—who have better health outcomes, including a longer life span.​​​​​​

“Late onset menopause has been shown in some studies to be associated with decreasedbone loss,vascular disease, anddementia,” saysCheryl Cox Kinney,physician and President-Elect of the Menopause Society, in addition toincreased longevity. Plus, as Williams points out, menopause can change body composition and insulin resistance, as well as raising a woman’s risk for several health conditions from vascular disease to dementia.

Oktay adds to the list of potential benefits a reduced risk of diabetes and depression, not to mention more youthful skin, hair, and teeth. And those aesthetic effects aren’t just surface level; they can have a real and measurable impact on women’s body image and self-esteem. Areviewof 18 studies published in the journalWomen’s Healthin 2023 found that menopausal symptoms were consistently associated with a more negative body image, and the more intense and/or frequent a woman’s symptoms, the higher the negative impact. This research might have implications beyond women. According to Williams, the ovary is a “model of accelerated aging” and can “serve as a model for testing other treatments designed to slow aging.”

​​​The scientific interest in delaying menopause emerges from the intersection of fertility and anti-aging research. If ovarian aging holds the key to longevity, including expanded fertile years, then delaying menopause could be an answer to both.​​But one important question remains unanswered:​​Would artificially delaying menopause lead to the same outcomes as when it's naturally delayed? Researchers are optimistic that the answer is yes.

Oktay is currently offering an experimental procedure he’s been performing for​about​​the last four years​to delay menopause. Developed to helppreserve fertility for women undergoing cancer treatments, he and his team began to think about other indications for the procedure, realizing it could be applied to ovarian aging. “Basic science and clinical experience merged. We got to a point [of] 'Why not this?’”

Oktay says that the key is to this procedure is to do it before the rapid acceleration of egg loss—around 37 or 38 years old for most women. Patients undergo an outpatient​​laparoscopic procedure to retrieve the cortex, or the outer layer of the ovary, which contains tens of thousands of reserve eggs, also called primordial follicles. “We do this through three-quarter-inch incisions,” Oktay says. Patients return home that same day, and their tissue is frozen in a lab for about a decade.

When their AMH (antimullerian hormone) levels,​which forewarns​that menopause is near, fall below a critical threshold, patients return to the lab and have the tissue transplanted back into their body.“After the transplant, we expect about 60 percent of the reserve eggs in the tissue to survive,” he says. In the future, he says this survival rate may increase to 80 percent “making the grafts last even longer.”The greater the number of younger eggs that survive, the greater the potential they have to delay or reverse menopause.Oktay says that they are also able to transplant smaller amounts of tissue at three-year intervals (rather all in one shot) which could stretch out the delay even longer.

Oktay doesn’t know yet if this procedure will delay or even stop menopause—it’s still in experimental phases. So far, his clinical trial has only collected ovarian tissue. It will take another decade for the study’s participants to age into their perimenopausal years, and for the re-transplantations to begin. “The future of this area of research is bright,” Oktay says. “It's like we've planted the first seeds and we're waiting, letting it grow.”

As Oktay works on developing a surgical procedure, Williams and his team at Columbia University Fertility Center are currently examining whether low doses of theimmunosuppressant drug rapamycin could produce similar effects as the surgery.

​​​Rapamycin is alreadyFDA-approvedfor a range of use-cases unrelated to ovarian aging, including post-renal transplantation, and is widely available, intensively studied, and has an excellent safety profile according to Williams.​If rapamycin sounds familiar it’s also because the drug has become popular among “anti-agers” after being touted by author and doctor Peter Attia for its purported longevity and health benefits, but more research is needed to definitively prove this link.

Rapamycin works by inhibiting a protein called mTOR, a key component of the cellular pathway involved in aging and metabolic regulation.​​​​In preclinical mouse and cell systems models, inhibiting​this​activity extends ovarian lifespan,​which​preserv​es​egg quantity and quality, Williams explains. To go a layer deeper, Williams​theorizes that the drug will slow down the rate at which a woman’s eggs turn over every month. Instead of losing dozens every month, a woman might only lose 10, for example, while keeping the other eggs in her reserve. Like the surgery, the trick is to start taking the drug before menopause, as it cannot bring eggs back. It most likely wouldn’t work for postmenopausal women.

“It could very quickly be translated into an intervention that could have a meaningful impact for human health,” he says.

Proving this out in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial is the next step. Fifty women agreed to be part of a study calledVIBRANTwhich is ongoing.​￼​​￼​One thing that surprised Williams was how many women were interested in joining the study. He notes that one of the challenges of completing a clinical study is finding people who want to participate. But, with VIBRANT, that wasn't the case. “The day the study went live, we had over 100 people,” Williams says. That, he argues, “speaks to just how much interest there is” in delaying menopause.The women will take either low-dose rapamycin or placebo once a week for three months. Williams and his team will then follow them for nine additional months, tracking how rapamycin is (or isn’t) working.​￼​​​

Williams is hopeful but stresses that the team can’t draw definitive conclusions until the study is complete, but he noted that “one group is reporting benefits such as better mood, better memory, and feeling that their skin looks better, and another group is reporting that they feel the same.”

He reiterates that this research could also lead to ways to slow aging in general and prevent aging-related diseases. But the timeline for public availability depends on the clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approval, which could take several years.

(Can this 'anti-aging' drug live up to the hype? Here's what we know)

If this new research raises hard-to-answer questions about the purpose of menopause, it could also mandate a reassessment of motherhood and fertility. We understand the ability to become pregnant as an event limited by time and age, even with medical interventions like in vitro fertilization. Currently, women who become pregnant at 35 years old and older are considered “geriatric” pregnancies, monitored for complications ranging from increased risk of miscarriage to low birth weight, and preterm birth. For most women, fertility and egg quality rapidly declines at 35, with a substantial drop-off by 40 years old. But delaying menopause could change the timeline significantly: Women could be fertile well into their 50s and beyond.

Oktay believes that the rapid acceleration of medical research to delay or pause menopause might make society rethink the age at which it's ""expected"" for women to have children. “A big change is due to the way we perceive menopausal age,​​just like it happened to the perceptions on life expectancy,” he says.​Now, with modern medicine, it might be possible to live to over 100 years old. But menopause still happens around the same age, meaning as longevity increases, some women might spend more of their lives postmenopausal. “If​we are going to let women live that long, I think we also need to stretch significantly the reproductive lifespan and reproductive hormone lifespan, at least somewhat to improve quality of life,"" Oktay says.​

​​​But, having a baby later in life raises ethical questions.Deborah Gomez Kwolek, founding lead of the Mass General Women’s Health and Sex and Gender Medicine Program argues that the rapid speed of ovarian aging—twice that of regular aging—may have a real biological imperative. Having children earlier increases the likelihood that women will be alive long enough to raise their biological children. “Until you can really slow regular aging, you might not want to delay menopause too far,” she says, pointing to the age limits placed on parents who are interested in adopting.

For Williams’ part, he sees the implications of his and other work in this space more broadly: “What this work really invites is a broader rethinking of how we view ovarian aging—not necessarily to redefine when women should have children, but to reframe ovarian aging in the context of overall health and longevity,” he says. ""There’s no stigma around efforts to maintain brain health or prevent memory loss. Why should ovarian aging be viewed any differently?”

For many women, however, prolonging their reproductive years might not be a compelling argument to delay menopause. One of the primary benefits of menopause is the end of menstruation and the potential for unwanted pregnancy. There may be other risks as well.

The fact that​ovaries will produce​estrogen​​​​for longer could be a double-edged sword. It may slightly increase the risk of breast or endometrial cancer, Kwolek says, noting that it’s not a “major risk” while still emphasizing that women should be “careful.” Oktay acknowledges this risk as well, although he says that “there are studies that take into account these risks in terms of women having late menopause and their life expectancy [and] they still live longer.”

Kwolek also points out that there are other options that are more researched and have more of a track record, like IVF and HRT: “It may be better to just bank some eggs. The research [on delaying menopause] is really cutting edge, but it's also really niche at this point and there's some catching up to do.”

As medical researchers race to find treatments to delay menopause and slow ovarian aging, we’ll soon have to answer the questions that their work raises. Oktay believes ovarian longevity is inevitable—that the scientific inquiry itself is the result of expanded lifespans. “Medical advances are making women and men live longer, and women live even longer. [Women] end up spending close to half of their life in menopause, which did not [happen] 50 years ago,” Oktay points out.

It’s a provocative rethinking of the way in which women age, particularly the rapid progression from perimenopause to postmenopause that’s currently perceived as both natural and inevitable. The assumption that women must spend decades of their life postmenopausal is a uniquely modern one—and, historically, we’ve made many assumptions about women’s bodies that have proven wrong. Maybe we’re due for another shift.

39,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/article/stages-of-cancer-early-screening,"You’ve probably heard of the four stages of cancer—but there’s another even earlier stage that experts say can make a huge difference in treating the disease.

While most of us have heard of stage I, II, and III cancer—and especially the grimmest stage IV—many people don't know there's also an earlier stage of cancer known as stage 0.

Until recently, that included Tina Knowles, the mother of singer Beyonce, who revealed a breast cancer diagnosis in her new memoir. In aninterviewabout the importance of getting screened early and often for cancer she said, ""I didn't know that there was a stage 0. I could have caught this at stage 0 if I had not missed my mammogram.""

(When should you get screened for breast cancer—and how often?)

It’s unsurprising that Knowles didn’t know about stage 0 as it isn’t as commonly diagnosed as the other stages of cancer. It also isn’t detectable for many types of cancer and often goes by a different name.

Here's what stage 0 cancer is, what sets it apart from other stages of cancer, and why regular cancer screenings are probably the only way you’re going to catch it.

There are typically thought to be four main stages of cancer. Though sometimes determining these stages can bemore complex, they are most often settled on by the TNM (Tumor, Nodes, and Metastasis) staging system—a diagnostic method oncologists follow to identify the size and location of a tumor and how far cancer cells have spread throughout the body.

Stage Iof most types of cancermeans a malignant (cancerous) growth of cells (known as a tumor) has been identified but is still small andconfined to the organ where it originated.

This stage also means that, while those cells are invasive within that organ, they have not spread to any lymph nodes, explains Hatem Soliman, a breast oncologist at the Moffitt CancerCenter in Tampa, Florida. This is important because lymph nodes are found atmore than 800convergences of major blood vessels around the body—cancer identified in any of them means it had to spread from its original location to get there.

Stage II cancermeans the primary tumor is large enoughto meet sizing criteriathat varies by cancer type. It usually also means cancer cells have been discovered in nearby lymph nodes.

(Our bodies are unique. Our cancers are too.)

Stage III canceris more advanced because it means the primary tumor has grown beyond stage II sizing criteria and that cancer cells are spreading to more lymph nodes.

Stage IV canceris often called metastatic cancer and means the tumor has grown further still and that the cancer has spread to many more lymph nodes and other parts of the body—often including invading vital organs, explains Elena Ratner, a physician and gynecologic oncologist at Yale Cancer Center in Connecticut. This pervasive spread makes it much harder to contain or eradicate the disease.

Stage 0 cancer is different from these other stages because it means abnormal cells have been identified somewhere in the body, but those cells may not yet be cancerous. And, unlike cancer cells in stage I, they’re not invading even the surrounding tissue of the organ where they originated.

These abnormal cells are also usually too small to form a tumor, so they generally cannot be picked up on internal organ scans like an ultrasound or MRI. They can be discovered on external tissue, however, and are frequently identified in breast tissue, thanks to routine mammograms.

Stage 0 cancer is also sometimes calledcarcinoma in situbecause ""in situ"" is Latin for ""in place.” Sometimes a prefix is also attached to indicate where the worrisome cells are located—such asadenocarcinoma in situ, which refers to affected cell glands in the cervix, lungs, or gastrointestinal tract.

When discovered in breast tissue, stage 0 cancer is diagnosed asductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, with ""ductal"" referring to the milk ducts in the breasts.

(What are dense breasts? How this common condition complicates cancer detection.)

DCIS “only becomes stage I, II, III, or IV cancer when it bursts through the milk ducts and starts spreading,"" says Mehra Golshan, deputy chief medical officer for surgical services at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital in Connecticut.

That doesn’t always happen though. ""Not all stage 0 breast cancer becomes invasive,” he says, “but over time, some do.""

Because stage 0 cancer can evolve unexpectedly—sometimes months or even years after the abnormal cells are first discovered—patients “need to be followed closely to determine that this area doesn’t develop into cancer,” says Syma Iqbal, a physician and gastrointestinal oncologist at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles.

Sometimes doctors and patents decide not to wait to see though, she says, and choose to target the abnormal cells with localized radiation or surgical interventions.

Whilepreventive treatmentslike these are not ideal, they are greatly preferred over cancer that isn't discovered until it has spread and is wreaking havoc on multiple organs and systems throughout the body—requiring more invasive treatments like chemotherapy.

This is why the American Cancer Societyrecommendsfor women to get screened for cervical cancer beginning at age 25 and for breast cancer starting between ages 40 and 45. The organization also suggests colorectal cancer screening for everyone beginning at age 45; for some men to get screened for prostate cancer at age 45; and for people who smoke or those with a family history of cancer to consider getting checked even sooner.

When caught and treated because of early screening, “stage 0 breast cancer has a survival rate approaching 99 percent,"" says Golshan.

Ratner agrees. ""Both doctors and patients get very lucky if the cancer is caught in stage 0 as it is much easier to cure,"" she says. ""It is the most favorable stage of cancer by far and has the best prognosis.""

40,National Geographic,Science,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/health/article/marathon-running-brain-myelin,"A study of long-distance runners shows the brain’s remarkable ability to adapt—by burning its own fat.

Carlos Matute wasn’t looking for a scientific breakthrough when he laced up his shoes for a long run. But as the miles ticked by, theneuroscientistfrom the University of the Basque Country found himself chasing a persistent question: “How do we make it to the finish line, being conscious, after having our energy stores depleted?”

That curiosity led to a surprising possible answer. Ina recent studyinNature Metabolism, Matute found that myelin—the fatty insulation wrapped about nerve fibers—provides energy when fuel runs low, such as during a grueling endurance event like a marathon. Some headlines have sensationalized the finding as the brain “eating itself,” but Matute says the truth is far more nuanced—and promising. Instead, it adds evidence of how the brain adapts and changes, even well into adulthood.

For his study, Matute and colleagues scanned the brains of 10 recreational runners using MRI before and after a marathon, and again two weeks to two months later. In the two days post-marathon, myelin was reduced in 12 of the 100 areas evaluated; the affected areas were involved in motor coordination, sensory integration, and emotion, regions frequently used during running. Two months after the marathon, myelin levels recovered.

(This is why running is the ultimate cardiovascular sport.)

The team determined the results were not due to dehydration. Instead, it seems that the brain is using myelin, which is mostly lipids or “brain fat” as Matute calls it, as fuel. “When there is no glucose coming from the bloodstream, then [the brain] has to use whatever it has at hand,” says Matute. For a neuron, this means myelin.

Participants ranged in age from 45 to 73, suggesting that even older brains remain remarkably adaptable. “Nobody foresaw that this would happen, that the structure of our brain may change so rapidly, in the time which it takes you to run the marathon,” says Matute.

Matute doesn’t believe the temporary drop in myelin leads to noticeable cognitive changes. He suspects the brain routinely taps into myelin for fuel, just at levels too low to detect—except during extreme events like a marathon.

But there’s no need to panic, he says. The changes were short-lived—and may even be healthy. “You exercise everything, including your myelin metabolism,” he says.

Running has long been linked to brain benefits. It boosts mood-regulating chemicals likedopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, which can ease anxiety and depression. That famous “runner’s high,” once chalked up to endorphins, may come fromendocannabinoids—the brain’s natural version of cannabis.

(Here’s how to get high on your hormones—naturally.)

Aerobic exercise also seems to spur the birth of new neurons in the hippocampus, the brain region critical for memory and learning. Over time, these changes may protect against cognitive decline.

Marathon running has been studied less than running in general, but some studies show these trends hold up over 26 miles. Onestudy reportedthat some regions of the hippocampus were larger in marathon runners than in healthy controls. Astrid Roeh, a physician at the University of Augsburg,found that marathonrunners exhibited fewer depressive symptoms than sedentary people over six months and reported the best moods the day after the marathon.

(Humans were built for long-distance running.)

Inanother study, Roeh found that marathon running led to changes in the brain’s electrical activity, as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG). Like Matute’s findings in myelin, these changes were transient. “The changes in EEG patterns indicate that there are alterations in how neural circuits are functioning and communicating,” she says.

This reorganization in response to experience is called neuroplasticity. She hypothesizes that regular physical activity may prime the brain for plasticity. “If someone is already physically active, then intense challenges like a marathon might have a stronger — or at least more coordinated — neuroplastic effect,” she says. “The system is ready to respond more effectively.”

However, not all brain changes are positive. Marathoners and endurance athletes are particularly prone to overtraining syndrome, says Luana Main, a professor at Deakin University. “A lot of endurance athletes are still of the mindset that more is always better,” she says. But doing more without sufficient rest, especially when sick or stressed, taxes the body too much.

Overtraining syndrome leads to injury and poor performance and can take months or years to recover from. It also affects the brain. “Changes in mood state are often one of the first changes that occur before you see a decrement in performance,” says Main. Overtrained athletes tend to feel grumpy, overwhelmed, and tired. “They’re just not loving life,” she says.

(No time to exercise? Just five minutes still has a big impact.)

Ina review, Main and her colleagues found that cognitive function, particularly reaction time, was impaired when athletes were overreaching or overtraining. Main says that because cognition is affected, people are more likely to make errors and become injured.

Paying attention to these cognitive effects can be helpful. In adifferent review of the research, Main and colleagues found that subjective measures, such as mood and perceived stress, were more sensitive to increased training loads than objective measures, such as heart rate and oxygen consumption. By tracking reaction times with online games and moods with daily journaling, athletes can know when they may be overdoing it.

Avoiding overtraining requires incorporating adequate rest and recovery into training. Main emphasizes that risk is not a reason to avoid exercise; however, the numerous benefits of exercise outweigh the bad. But, for the small part of the population doing huge training loads, “More is not always better,” she says. “Sometimes less is more.”

Matute agrees. “For people who worry, ‘Should I stop running?’ I would say, ‘No, never, as long as you train properly.’”

41,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-portraits-of-san-diego-a-culture-of-happiness,"Uncover the vibrant community, rich history, and sprawling green spaces in America’s finest city with National Geographic Photographer Kiliii Yüyan.

National Geographic Photographer Kiliii Yüyan is no stranger to travel, often spending months around the globe to understand the world through storytelling and photography. His adventures have taken him high above the Arctic Circle to the depths of tropical waters, capturing imagery of lionfish and other animals.

On a recent trip toSan Diego, California, he took his storytelling prowess across the city to learn more about the culture, green and blue spaces, and community. What he found was that the city’s infectious optimism offered a different kind of thrill.

“It’s really hard not to feel the joy,” Yüyan says of his time inAmerica’s finest city. “It was all around, all the time. I don’t think that sort of unadulterated joy is everywhere.”

From a smiling guitarist inBalboa Parkto a child running in and out of the Pacific Ocean atLa Jolla Cove, Yüyan encountered San Diegans finding happiness in the simple act of being outside together. Those random interactions, he says, are just as meaningful for visitors who want to connect with the city.

“I think my San Diego experience would have been very different if I hadn't connected with anybody,” says Yüyan, who was trying to capture the cultural hub through his lens. “I'm looking for intimate moments that are real, and there were lots of them to be had.”

Albert Lin and the Joy of Cultural Connection

To better understand the rich historical layers that shape San Diego’s diverse cultural and ecological landscape, Yüyan meets with National Geographic Explorer Albert Lin. A scientist and storyteller, Lin has spent his career uncovering ancient civilizations around the world. Here in Albert's hometown, he brings that same passion for discovery to help Yüyan connect with the region’s past to its vibrant present.

“Every year I spend here, I feel like I’m discovering something new,” says Lin.

The city is a cultural hub (almost 700,000 immigrants live here) and remains the most biologically diverse county in the continental United States.

Some of that diversity is on display at theSan Diego Natural History Museumin Balboa Park. Here, exhibits showcase fossils of prehistoric sea creatures that once swam the waters covering the region, alongside a wealth of native plants and wildlife displays that reflect the county’s varied ecosystems. Lin also introduces Yüyan to the museum’s focus on the area’s deep indigenous roots, including the Kumeyaay tribe, who’ve lived here for over 12,000 years.

In nearbyMission Trails Regional Park, Dr. Stanley Rodriguez, the Director of Kumeyaay Community College, shows how tangible those historic Indigenous connections remain when he takes the duo to well-worn, communal spaces where families ground local acorns into food sources for their families.

“That's part of the beauty of indigenous knowledge. It's all about place, and your connections to that place,” he says. “He painted the picture for us, and I can just envision how beautiful that was.”

San Diego’s breadth of diverse ecosystems still encourages community gatherings. Locals often take to these same green spaces for hiking and mountain biking. A reminder that centuries after the first people came through here, the land continues to serve the people who live here today.

Tara Monsod and the Joy of Community

At the open-air Tuna Harbor Dockside Market, Yüyan meets local executive chefTara Monsodwhile she speaks with local fishermen and inspects spiny lobsters and uni. It is clear that the two-time James Beard-nominated chef visits for the community connection as much as the fresh, local ingredients themselves.

“The camaraderie here, it makes me happy,” says Monsod, who credits time with the fishmongers, farmers, and fellow chefs for her culinary success. “I really enjoy my job. I just feel blessed every day to be able to do that.”

At the restaurants where she is the executive chef,Le CoqandAnimae, Monsod mixes cross-cultural influence and local produce that comes from nearby farms. The combination of her culinary training, access to fresh ingredients, and inspiration from the community allows her to play with her food in bold and creative ways that are typically San Diegan, says Yüyan.

“[San Diego is a] place that you can allow your curiosity to roam,” says Yüyan. “There's a lot of genuine joy and happiness, and people just letting down their hair, willing to be vulnerable in front of each other.”

Rob Machado and the Joy of Natural Spaces

At La Jolla Shores, Yüyan connects with environmentalist and former professional surfer,Rob Machado. Fans–young, old, and new–bashfully approach the icon and are met with warm hugs and a wide smile. Community connection is at the heart of his passion, says Machado, who works with two charities, theRob Machado FoundationandChallenged Athletes Foundation, to help others find the joy that surfing in San Diego has given to him, and to foster a love for the land. His work with the Challenged Athletes Foundation empowers differently abled youth to embrace surfing.

“For me, sharing the stoke of surfing is the greatest gift to give someone,” says Machado.

Machado’s joy was palpable, says Yuyan, who spent time watching Machado interact with the young athletes.

“The joy on Rob's face. [He’s] so, so proud of them. It's so pure,” says Yüyan. This connection between Rob and the athletes, along with the way surfing integrates mind, body, and soul, is a reflection of how so many San Diegans approach life—living with presence and joy.

Whether in its parks, on its shores, or in its kitchens, Yüyan found the people of San Diego have captured the unique ability to be fully present in their joy. And visitors who want in on the action are welcome.

“San Diego makes me optimistic,” says Yüyan. “This is a place where people can live, work, play, and feel like a community. You rarely see that in any large place in a big city, and it helps you see the world a little differently.”

42,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-your-next-adventure-tokyo-japan,"Join National Geographic photographer Jonathan Irish on a journey through Tokyo, Japan, capturing the city's vibrant food scene, bustling open-air markets, and rich culture of craftsmanship.

There’s a talent to making things beautiful, and in Japan, there’s a word for it.Monozukuri, which translates to “craftsmanship”, speaks to the country’s devotion to high-quality and often visually mesmerizing creations. Precision, patience, and artistry are highly prized, and across Japan’s eateries, markets, studios, and workshops, travelers are invited to join in.

On a recent journey toTokyo, National Geographic photographerJonathan Irishexplored hidden gems, bustling neighborhoods, and vibrant cultural districts in this lively, cosmopolitan metropolis, and found thatmonozukuriabounds.

“Despite Tokyo's rapid growth and modern landscape, the city's rich history of craftsmanship remains a timeless part of its identity today,” says Irish. “I came away with a strong impression of just how much care and effort are spent on doing it right, doing it well, and making it beautiful.”

DiscoverTokyo, Japan, through Irish’s lens, and see why this city should be your next adventure.

When it comes to seamless cultural immersion, Tokyo―a bona fide culinary capital ―ranks high. Open-minded travellers are rewarded with unique flavors, homegrown ingredients, and cooking styles that reflect both traditional Japanese culture and modern global influences.

In Tokyo’sSangenjaya neighborhood, a must-visit foodie hub just west of the popular Shibuya, Irish started his gastro-journey atTokyo Gyozaro. There, pan-fried dumplings known asgyoza—stuffed with pork and green onion—made for the perfect first bite.

Food is even faster atIzakaya Hoshigumi. The word “izakaya,” which loosely translates to “stay, drink, place,” underscores the true nature of these establishments—few seats, tasty bites and great sips. Hoshigumi is renowned for its signature fried skewers calledkushiage, which come in a variety of meat, vegetable, and seafood options.

“It’s meant to be a quick bite,” says Irish of the breadcrumb-coated skewers. “It’s the kind of thing you crave on your way home from work or after a late night out.”

Meanwhile, the experience atYukihanabioffers a refreshing change of pace. This upscale, stylish restaurant specializes in food from Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost region. Here, you’ll want to linger to savor both the dishes and the gorgeous presentation of delicate sashimi or crunchykaraage(Japanese fried chicken).

And atKozakura, a cozy neighborhood hotspot, the must-try dish iskatsudon—a deep-fried, gluten-free pork cutlet served over rice and topped with an egg.While you wait, chat with Uehara Hiroshi (Hiroshi-san) the affable host—who was a customer here for years before moving behind the counter.

“I enjoyed the food, but the atmosphere was even better. It’s a must-visit for anyone who wants to enjoy great meal in a cool space,"" says Irish.

Tsukiji Outer Marketis one of Tokyo’s most vibrant and exciting spots to visit today. The market's bustling atmosphere and diverse offerings make it a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the authentic charm of Tokyo. With over 300 shops and restaurants, it’s a place where you can discover everything from fresh sushi to unique, handcrafted goods, all while soaking in the lively energy of the market’s stalls and street scenes.

At the renowned century-old seafood storeTanaka Shoten, Irish sampledsaketsuke—a distinctive Japanese dish in which fish is preserved by soaking it in sake. The shop owner’s grandfather started the business as a hobby, but now the tiny stall hosts both regulars and curious travelers. “There’s big love for it there,” says Irish. “And it’s a really interesting flavor.”

History is a throughline in the plentiful market stalls. The founder ofSugimoto Hamono, a Japanese knife shop,was an 1800s samurai sword maker. Shopkeeper Ishikawa-san walked Irish through the modern options, guiding him to the best choice for his home-cooking needs. Having his purchase engraved in katakana (syllabic Japanese script) made it even more special.

For a unique sweet treat, visitTsukiji Solatsuki.Their take on the popular strawberry daifuku―the red bean paste-stuffed mochi (in flavors ranging from chocolate to mango) topped with a large local strawberry―is even tastier than it looks. Be sure to try the white strawberry options too: They are fully ripened and surprisingly sweet.

And if you need a break from busy market, head to the second floor where you can sip a cup of coffee or bowl of broth (miso soup) in a quiet, nostalgic atmosphere. For almost 50 years, the tinyKissa Makoshop has been serving local market staff delicious brews in a traditional setting, acting as a true hidden gem within this wonderful market.

Throughout Tokyo, artists dedicate themselves to mastery of all kinds. At theShunkaen Bonsai Museum,thousands of bonsai trees, some hundreds of years old, are painstakingly cared for and curated. (It can take as long as four hours a day just to water them all!) For Irish, watching bonsai master Kunio Kobayashi’s hands fly through the air as he worked was beyond breathtaking.

He found that same patient dedication at theTakahashi Kobo Art Studiowhere Irish worked alongside Yukiko Takahashi, a sixth-generation owner of the studio, to learn the art of Edo-period, or ukiyo-e, woodblock printing. Together, they layered ink-laden, engraved wooden blocks in a particular sequence on the paper, following the art. Dating back to the 17th century, this artmaking technique has been perfected over generations, with the Takahashi family business, established more than 160 years ago, continuing the tradition. The beauty of the finished product stands as a testament to their perseverance and artistry.

Patience is also required at theKoffee Mameya Kakeru, where patrons can opt for anomakase—literally translated to 'I’ll leave it up to you'—a chef’s choice coffee bar experience. In this setting, baristas here are like scientists (with the white lab coats to prove it), delivering methodic perfection in the form of cold brews, pour-overs, innovative cocktails and zero-proof beverages. In many ways, the omakase experience is the perfect example of how Tokyo’s craftsmanship perseveres, requiring trust in those with the skills to deliver the experience. “The space here is beautiful and quite special,” says Irish. “It’s the kind of place where you can walk in, relax, and enjoy a really good cup of coffee.”

From vibrant culinary experiences to immersive cultural traditions,Tokyooffers a journey that celebrates both its rich history and modern ingenuity. As Irish discovered, the city invites you to not only witness its beauty but to become part of a living legacy. Whether you're savoring a meal, exploring a market, or marveling at traditional arts, Tokyo awaits—ready to offer those who visit an unforgettable adventure."

44,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/how-to-cook-kedgeree-british-classic-with-indian-origins,"Originating in India during colonial rule and inspired by a traditional dish containing lentils, this combination of rice, smoked fish and egg has become a breakfast favourite in the UK.

Smoked fish flaked into gently spiced rice, topped with egg — kedgeree is a beloved breakfast dish that’s also enjoyed for brunch, lunch and dinner around the UK. Yet its origins can be traced back to India, centuries ago.

It’s derived from khichdi, a one-pot rice and lentil dish synonymous with both comfort and celebration in South Asia. The earliest written references to khichdi — whose name comes from the Sanskrit word khiccā, meaning a mixture of rice and lentils — appear in the Indian epic Mahabharata, believed to have been compiled between the third century BCE and fourth century CE.

Khichdi has since spread globally, but it first captured English hearts when it made its way onto the tables of East India Company staff in their early days as traders in India in the 17th and 18th centuries. Back then, the company’s employees were mostly eating local food. Englishman John Grose, who travelled to India in the 1750s, wrote that many even preferred this ‘country-diet’ as it tasted better than their own cuisine and was more suited to the climate.

In the absence of precise historical records, one can at best infer how khichdi transformed into kedgeree. “Khichdi would have been served as a soothing dish at breakfast,” says food historian and author Lizzie Collingham. “The British enjoyed eggs for breakfast and fish would have been served in the mornings, while it was still fresh, before the arrival of the fridge.” The lentils were eventually abandoned, and khichdi became kidgeri, then kedgeree. It travelled back to Britain via returning officials, soldiers and traders along with a taste for ‘curry’, the generic word they used to describe Indian cuisine.

Commercial curry powder was advertised as early as the mid-1780s, according to Laura Kelley, author of The Silk Road Gourmet. Thefirst known written instructions for making kedgeree were recorded soon after, byScottish woman Stephana Malcolm, ina diary she started in 1790. While Malcolm spent most of her life in rural Dumfriesshire, her three brothers travelled extensively. One of them, John, rose to prominence in the EastIndia Company as the Governor of Bombay, opening her eyes and palate to dishes such as kedgeree and mulligatawny soup.

Malcolm’s recipe, available on the National Library of Scotland’s website, uses ‘cold boiled haddock’ or ‘a bit of cod’ along with ‘minced’ hard-boiled eggs warmed in butter. Cayenne pepper is the only spice. Her fish and rice are freshly prepared, but the NLS notes that by Victorian times, thrifty housewives often made kedgeree from leftover ingredients. Curried dishes were seen as a frugal way to transform produce and give leftovers a fresh lease of life, says Collingham.

As the ambitions of the British in India went from commerce to colonisation in the 18th and 19th centuries, their eating habits evolved. While soldiers in camps and rural areas would continue to consume traditional Indian food, the higher-ranking officers in towns and cantonments would create more anglicised big feasts, or ‘burra khanas’, writes food historian David Smith in his 2019 paper, ‘The Sublime Art of Curry-Making: Culinary Trends in British India’. And with more British officials being stationed in India during the height of the Empire as military ambitions intensified, Indian food fell off the main menu, with Anglo-Indian dishes gaining favour at formal dinners and banquets.

Over in Britain, the same dishes found their way to upper- and middle-class Victorian tables. Up until the early 19th century, breakfast was a mostly frugal meal, but this changed during Queen Victoria’s reign. Inher book A History of English Food, Clarissa Dickson Wright describes how, from the 1830s, breakfast became a ‘rather elaborate meal’ served from about 10am. While Queen Victoria would enjoy a boiled egg with a golden spoon, others around her would tuck into a feast that included ‘fancy dishes such as kedgeree or devilled kidneys’. In 1861, the queen’s chief cook, Charles Elmé Francatelli, even created and published a version of kedgeree for ‘curry’-loving Florence Nightingale.

By 1845, the advent of the railways had made the transport of smoked fish more convenient. Collingham suggests that the upper classes would have been familiar with Scottish smoked fish from their hunting parties there. Kippers (smoked herring) started becoming popular for breakfast in southern England, and the stagecoach connection from Findon, south of Aberdeen, to Edinburgh and London shot finnan haddie (smoked haddock) to fame. The method of curing didn’t give the fish a long shelf life, so it made sense to flake it into kedgeree to save on waste and infuse the dish with flavour.

In 1845, Eliza Acton published Modern Cookery for Private Families, featuring a version of the dish with ‘slightly beaten eggs’ stirred through. She suggests that ‘cold turbot, brill, salmon, soles, John Dory and shrimps, may all be served in this form’ and recommends ‘Mauritian chatney’ as an accompaniment.

Mrs Beeton’s 1861 kedgeree recipe, meanwhile, incorporates smoked haddock but omits curry powder, which does appear in her other Anglo-Indian dishes. Following her death, the brand franchise was sold to publishers Ward, Lock&Co, which printed recipes for versions with boiled fish, lentils and even chopped cold meat well into the middle of the 20th century.

Curry powder eventually made its way into this quick, family-pleasing, fusion dish that became as acceptable for supper as for breakfast. And today, despite plenty of variation, there are some common denominators — long-grain or basmati rice, eggs and fish. However, recipes tend to fall into two camps: a low-waste version suitable for home cooks and a richer, more lavish rendition that would please a royal court. The former tends to be lighter, with an optional splash of cream, and the egg is mostly hard-boiled. The latter, meanwhile, is often heavier. Double cream and lemon might feature. The egg could be soft-boiled or poached and perched atop the rice, for added theatre and creaminess. It’s found on the menu at high-end restaurants and has enjoyed a resurgence since featuring in the first episode of Downton Abbey in 2010.

Kedgeree is one of the most popular breakfast dishes at The Ritz London, and the hotel’s 2018 cookbook recipe requires the creation of a curry sauce to serve alongside it, complete with cardamom, ginger and cumin alongside curry powder and chicken stock.

At Francatelli restaurant, in London’s St James’s Hotel&Club, chef William Drabble serves modern versions of recipes inspired by Queen Victoria’s cook. He alternates between a lighter, more homely version and something closer to risotto. “It’s good, tasty, healthy, honest and comforting; I don’t think it gets enough recognition,” he says of kedgeree.

Many chefs, food writers and restaurateurs are making an effort to change this, however, putting it back on the menu and adding their own flourishes. Pete Taylor, co-owner of posh London fish-and-chip restaurant The Mayfair Chippy, has created a kedgeree scotch egg with milk-poached smoked haddock and spiced rice.

At Vandal restaurant in Warrington, kedgeree is made with miso-baked cod, spinach, katsu curry and a poached egg, before being smoked and unveiled at the table from under a cloche. And chef Shuko Oda of London’s Koya serves a Japanese-British version for breakfast, flavoured with bonito and niboshi (dried anchovy).

In Edinburgh, Kelsey Garthwaite, owner of Pie Dolly, has captured the flavour of kedgeree in a quiche, complete with a turmeric pastry crust. She describes kedgeree as a typical Edinburgh dish, although it’s not easy to find a classic version in the Scottish capital nowadays. Roseleaf bar and cafe in Leith, however, has served it since 2007, made to an old family recipe. “We’re using our grandmother’s recipe here and at home. Kedgeree is perfect just the way it is. Why mess with it?” says owner Graham Parsons. Perhaps this explains kedgeree’s enduring appeal. It’s perfect just the way it is and the best way to cook it is however you wish.

Inspired by home-cooked versions, this kedgeree is elevated by home-made curry powder. You could add a splash of double cream and a squeeze of lemon juice if you like, and extra powder can be stored in an airtight container for later use.

Takes: 30-35 minsServes: 4-6Ingredients300g basmati rice, uncooked500ml whole milk4 undyed smoked boneless haddock fillets, halved4-6 medium eggs50g butterquarter nutmeg, freshly gratedcurly parsley to serve (or flat leaf parsley, coriander or dill)

For the curry powder1½ tsp coriander seeds1½ tsp cumin seeds6 black peppercornshalf-inch stick cinnamon1 tsp ground ginger2 tsp turmeric½ tsp hot chilli powder2 green cardamom pods, seeded

METHOD

To make the curry powder, toast the coriander, cumin and black peppercorns in a small pan over a medium heat for 30 seconds, shaking gently until warm. Tip into a spice/coffee grinder with the cinnamon stick, ginger, turmeric, chilli powder and green cardamom seeds and grind to a fine powder (if you don’t have a spice grinder, use a pestle and mortar to powder the toasted spices, then mix in the other ingredients). Set aside.

Rinse the rice, drain and leave in the sieve. Gently warm the milk in a pan large enough to hold the haddock fillets. Halve the fillets and place, skin side up, in the pan. Cover and poach on a high simmer for 8 mins until cooked and flaky — the skin should peel easily off the thickest fillet if you run a butter knife under it.

Transfer the fish to a plate using a slotted spoon and strain the milk into a measuring jug. Add just-boiled water to make it up to 600ml. Pour into the saucepan the rice was rinsed in, then bring to a rapid boil, tip in the rice, bubble quickly and cover and simmer for 12 minutes until cooked. Remove from the heat and move to a cool spot, leaving the lid on.

Put the eggs in a pan of cold water and boil for 6-8 mins. Drain, submerge in cold water, peel and slice. Remove the skin from the cooked haddock and flake the fish.

Melt the butter in a large, non-stick saucepan. Mix in a generous tbsp of the curry powder, then fold in the fork-fluffed rice, fish and nutmeg until everything is well incorporated. Add salt to taste. Serve with the sliced eggs and scatter with the chopped parsley.

45,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/the-old-forge-inverie-knoydart-scotland,"Tucked between sea and mountain, The Old Forge was once a cherished endpoint for hikers—now, revived by the hands of locals, adventurers are coming back to this iconic watering hole.

We were dropped off at the end of theUK's longest dead-end road. It felt like we had lost contact with the rest of the world. The wilds ofScotland’sKnoydartregion stretched before us—primal, remote, and magnetic. Somewhere out there layThe Old Forge, Britain's most remote mainland pub in the tiny village ofInverie. My partner Ines and I love a challenge. But before ordering drinks at the bar, we had two days of hiking ahead—through some of the Highlands' toughest and most diverse landscapes.

Our journey began aboard the overnightCaledonian Sleeperfrom London Euston train station. Watching the manic city fade as we drifted to sleep, knowing we'd wake in the untamed Highlands, felt like a small adventure. Stepping off the train inFort William, we were taken by taxi to the tiny settlement ofKinloch Hourn, where our 15.2-mile hike began under the glare of midday sunshine.

From Kinloch Hourn, we skirted the steep southern shore of Loch Hourn, a narrow, fjord-like sea loch cutting between theGlenelgand Knoydart peninsulas. The path twisted through rugged, rolling terrain, sometimes clinging to the loch's edge, and all too frequently deteriorating into marshy ground that clung to our boots and splashed our legs with mud. But the inconvenience seemed trivial when we were rewarded with the majestic views over Loch Hourn.

(Related: What’s it like to run one of the UK’s most unusual pubs?)

Once a drovers' and deerstalkers' route, this ancient path also has a darker history as a coffin road, where bodies were taken to Kilchoan burial ground in Inverie. The isolation was profound; aside from our conversation and the occasional cascade from the hills—there was no sound. A nearby herd of highland cows eyed us suspiciously, seemingly wondering whether this group of bipeds would disrupt their tranquil glen. A serene stillness hung in the air over a land both unforgiving and regal.

In preparation for the hike, we learned about Knoydart’s fascinating local history. This 55,000-acre wilderness sits between two lochs, Nevis and Hourn—Gaelic for ""heaven"" and ""hell."" The irony isn't lost when reflecting on the region's past. Once thriving under the clan system, Knoydart was devastated when tenant farmers were forced out to make way for sheep during theHighland Clearancesof the 18th and 19th centuries. Thousands were uprooted, leading to mass emigration and a decline inGaelic culture.

Today, just 120 people live here, maintaining a way of life that's rare in the modern world. As a testament to the sense of solidarity in this remote area, the community came together to rescue The Old Forge in March 2022, which means most of these residents now have a stake in the pub.

After an arduous five-hour hike, we arrived at our destination for the night,Barrisdale Bothy. We were tired but in good spirits. Like most bothies, it's a basic stone cottage with a communal room and wooden bunks, but Barrisdale offers rare luxuries: cold running water, electricity, and a toilet. Maintained by the local landowner, the bothy has a £5 (U.S. $6.63) per-person fee, payable via an honesty box. Beds are first come, first served, so bring a sleeping bag and mat. Alternatively, camping is allowed for the same fee.

After a restful night, we were on the upward slope to Mam Barrisdale, the route's highest point. Swarms ofmidgesthrived in the humid, overcast air, but these were minor irritations compared to the exhilaration of looking back at the cobalt loch. Our sights were now set on pushing through the misty peaks toward the 450-meter (1,476-foot) trig point. The reward was a prime view ofLadhar BheinnKnoydart's highest mountain, often hailed as Scotland's wildestMunro—a Scottish mountain with an elevation of more than 914 meters (3,000 feet).

Despite being downhill from there, we still had to trudge through the boggiest terrain, which at one point decided it wanted my boot. Eventually, the path dried, allowing our pace to quicken as we headed towards the sparkling waters of Inverie Bay. Turning one last corner, we saw a post office among a handful of shops on the tiniest main streets and The Old Forge signpost overlooking the ""heavenly"" Loch Nevis. We had made it!

The pub is a modest, whitewashed building with a cozy interior, and it was surprisingly busy with a vibrant mix of day trippers, locals, and hikers. As we took our seats with celebratory pints in hand,Will O'Neil, the pub’s manager,welcomed us with a warm smile.""It started as a bit of a joke, but then we wanted to buy our pub,"" said Will, whoepitomizesthe spirit and resilience of this tiny corner of Scotland. He added, ""Running a pub as remote as this is hard work. Many of the shareholders give their precious time to help out. There's so much to do but we love it.""

The pub’s Business Development Manager, Stephanie Harris, who grew up in Knoydart and foundedVisit Knoydart, captured the collaborative attitude of the village best when she said, “The best part of being a shareholder is playing an active role in the pub’s future.” She added, “I want to offer my skills in any way that would be useful.”

As we sipped our pints and rested our aching limbs, we reflected on Will's words and wondered if Inverie's story could be a blueprint for struggling communities. We couldn't think of a better one.

If you're planning to hike to The Old Forge, preparation is key. This is a remote and demanding route, so bring a map, GPS, and plenty of food and water. Also, let someone know your planned route and estimated arrival time. A lightweight sleeping bag and mat are essential if you’re staying in a bothy.

46,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-6-las-vegas-day-trips-you-have-to-experience,"National Geographic photographer Keith Ladzinski shares the wins that come from exploring activities, arts and culture beyond the big city lights.

Some of Las Vegas’s most fascinating attractions lie just outside the city center. Within a few hours’ drive of the home of some of the world’s best entertainment, travelers will find historic landmarks, unique communities and dramatic natural wonders.

National Geographic photographer Keith Ladzinski has built a career out of finding the best adventures around the world. But on his most recent road trip through some of Nevada’s lesser-known regions, the abundance of adventures surprised him.

Between rock climbing inArrow Canyon, exploring long-abandoned ghost towns, and stargazing under stunning night skies, Ladzinski discovered the joy that comes from discovering places that might only whisper for your attention.

These routes, all a short drive from Las Vegas, will inspire you to step off the Strip and into a new adventure.

Distance from Vegas: 1.5 hours

“You have these beautiful, giant, red sandstone formations,” explains Ladzinski of theValley of Fire State Park’sappeal. “It's a really great recreational place for people that want to go do overnights or multiple overnights and then have day trips into the sandstone canyons.”

If time is short, aim to visit at sunrise or sunset when the iron oxide in the rock shines vibrant in the light, making it feel like the desert is ablaze.

“It's like you've taken a saturation bar and cranked it to 10,” says Ladzinski. “It is a wild, wild place to see.”

For a bigger adventure, take the hour-long drive (a 4x4 will help) to Arrow Canyon. The four-mile-long slot canyon, set among 300-foot-tall limestone formations, greets visitors with a “Welcome to your wilderness” sign at the gate.

“It's this unbelievable place where you get to feel small, which is such a unique, cool thing in life,” says Ladzinski. Below the canyon’s towering cliffs, centuries-old petroglyphs mark parts of the winding, pedestrian trail. At the mouth of the canyon, look up and you may spot talented rock climbers quietly traversing the craggy walls.

Ladzinski suggests you keep your camera handy while exploring the canyon. “It has this really interesting color balance,” he says. “I've gone to this place many, many times and find it to be truly unique.""



Distance from Vegas: 30 minutes

Nevada’sfirst national conservation areais an outdoor adventure wonderland. Start at the Red Rocks Visitor Center, where you’ll find tips on how to make the most of your time here and get a sneak peek at flora and fauna that call the Mojave Desert home. Drivers and road bikers can take the 13-mile, one-way scenic drive, which offers breathtaking views of the unique landscapes (you’ll need atimed reservationbetween October and May) and a variety ofpicnic areas and trailheads.Mountain bikers have their own rugged designated trails which are equal parts exhilarating and beautiful.

“It's just a spider web network of trails,” says Ladzinski. “I think we did seven or eight miles in like an hour and a half, and we didn't even scratch the surface.”

For a ride of a different sort, book an experience withCowboy Trail Ridesto enjoy guided tours of the canyon by mule or horse. All are welcome no matter their experience in the saddle. Guests may also hike alongside the pack while watching weathered hands continue Nevada's long history of cowboy culture.

“It just was one of those romantic Western scenes,” Ladzinski says of his time there. “I got some great shots and cool moments. They are the real deal.”



Distance from Las Vegas: 60 minutes.

The Mt. Charleston Scenic Byway sets the scene as you ascend into the majestic Spring Mountains. “You have to go up this giant switchback to Mt. Charleston, and the whole time you're driving up, you’re just looking at the desert beneath you. It’s really cool,” recalls Ladzinski.

At the nearbyLee Canyon ski resort, travelers will find unexpected snowy adventures with a stunning backdrop. Skiing, snowboarding and more await, along with everything you need from boot rentals to day passes. And novice skiers needn’t fear: The terrain accommodates all skill levels. The resort even offers two ski lodges, perfect for apres-ski.



Distance to Las Vegas: 3 hours

“You can't have a bad time in Death Valley,” says Ladzinski. “I feel like December to February is the sweet spot. You're not going to overheat, and it's probably quieter, too.”

Make your way to the 600-foot-deepUbehebe Crater– the biggest of the area’s craters, which were created by volcanic explosions 2,100 years ago. The journey is an otherworldly experience. Drive to the rim, park and hike. Or follow one of the marked trails to one of the smaller craters nearby.

“It was all about witnessing this cracked landscape,” says Ladzinski, who found unique perches to capture the space. “You're in this high vantage point with mountains to one side and the valley on the other side. You're seeing the rolling clouds as they move across the landscape below you, and then in another direction, you're seeing the mountains rise back up. And there's a lot of texture and color, just from the erosion. It's a beautiful vista.”

Death Valley, the nation’s hottest, driest and lowest national park, is an obvious draw for tourists. Fortunately, the Nevada border town of Beatty offers road trippers comfortable lodging and plenty of dining options. There, local artisans have transformed the former Exchange Club into a wonder that demands a longer look.

“Talk about a place you could get lost in,” says Ladzinski. Among the buildings likely to capture your attention are a soon-to-open steampunk casino and motel—The Exchange Club—whose exterior is covered with intricate metal work ranging from open-mouth fish to intricate collections of gears.

“Outside is just the most intricate, wild metal work you've ever seen,” says Ladzinski, who had the chance to chat with artist James Henninger.

""He spoke so vehemently around the fact that this gave him purpose…and now he gets to go in there every day and just create and be the artist he is. Whether you appreciate sculpted metal art or not, you can't help but be drawn in by the detail.""

A few miles outside Beatty, theGoldwell Open Air Museumoffers more larger-than-life art. The40-year-old museum’spermanent collectionincludes “Lady Desert: The Venus of Nevada” – a Lego-like construction that, when the sun hits just right, is strikingly silhouetted against the mountains. Another, “The Last Supper” depicts the iconic artwork with a twist: No people, only the garments they would’ve worn draped to create the scene.

When you’re ready to stretch your legs,Spicer Ranch, a 120-acre private working ranch, is only 20 minutes away.Open to the general public for hiking, camping, and mountain biking, this desertscape offers visitors the chance to spot the area’s famous wild burro herds while exploring one of Nevada’s largest trail networks. And every year, about a thousand people descend on the property for SNRG (Southern Nevada Regional Gathering), a Burning Man event complete with gigantic art installations.



Time to Vegas: 3 hours

If your road-tripping heart desires whimsy, head for Nevada’s historic mining towns.Goldfield, once Nevada’s largest and richest city with a population of 20,000 people, now has a population of about 250 residents living amongst the original 20th-century-era buildings.

At theGoldfield Historic Cemetery, you’ll find quirky tombstone epitaphs (“Unknown Man died eating Library Paste, July 14, 1908”). AtRocket Bob’s Art Cars, banal automobiles are transformed into eccentric art. And at theInternational Car Forest of the Last Church(the largest collection of its kind in the country), more than 40 eccentrically arranged cars serve as a canvas for artists from around the globe—resulting in an alien-invasion-meets-surreal-forest feel. Preserved spaces likeGoldfield Historic High School– a 12-room schoolhouse built in 1907– offer history with a few ghosts to boot. (TheMizpah Hoteland theClown Motelin nearbyTonopahare other popular spots for haunted sightings.)

“It's just cool that those places exist,” Ladzinski says with a grin. “You can go within a few hours of Las Vegas, broaden your mind ,and see some things you'd be hard pressed to see in other places.”



Distance from Las Vegas: Within 30 minutes

Away from the neon lights of Las Vegas, a canvas of stars opens up. Ladzinski spent evenings admiring Jupiter and peeking at the Milky Way (a major win considering the galaxy is typically harder to see in the winter months). Ladzinski recalls how the starlight accentuated the beauty of the surroundings, illuminating desert stones, towering mountains, Joshua trees, turpentine broom, and Mojave sage. The night sky gave him plenty of opportunities to capture stunning photos—particularly near the ghost town ofRhyoliteand the snow-dusted peaks of Mt. Charleston.

And long before the first stars appeared on the inky black canvas, Ladzinski recalls, the sky had plenty to offer.

“We had this forever twilight,” he says. “In the desert, there's dust that's been pulled into the atmosphere. So, you get these long, elongated orange skies.”

Ladzinski’s road trip reminded him of the benefits of traveling with a slower pace and the charms of quiet towns. And that while the bright lights of Las Vegas have much to offer, there are beautiful places and remarkable experiences to be had in breathtaking natural surroundings that stretch far beyond the city limits."
47,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/where-to-eat-in-prince-edward-island,"The windswept coasts of Prince Edward Island that inspiredAnne of Green Gableshave also influenced an innovative new generation of chefs and farmers.

On a deserted beach on the far eastern coast of Canada's Prince Edward Island (also known as PEI), chef Nick Chindamo squats among a stand of low-growing weeds, their tips displaying the telltale yellowing of late summer. He rummages for a few seconds before holding out a fat, eight-leaved cluster of sea sandwort, an abundant coastal succulent in northern climates. “Try this,” he says. “It will surprise you.”

He’s right. The leaves, which resemble flattened versions of backyard-garden mainstays like ghost plant,are juicy, with a briny, cucumber-like flavor. Sandwort is among dozens of plants that Chindamo harvests during daily foraging adventures on various patches of scrub, sand, and forest that few would suspect of harboring a trove of edible plants—and that now make their way onto PEI restaurant menus.

The farm-to-table movement on the island was “about 10 years behind the times,” says Chindamo, thanks to a remote location. Up until the 1993 building of the Confederation Bridge, linking New Brunswick to southwestern PEI, the only way to get to there was by boat. But Chindamo, a self-described forager who likes to cook, is among a new generation of culinary innovators who are transforming Prince Edward Island into Canada’s eastern farm-to-table capital.

At 139 miles long and 39 miles at its widest point, Prince Edward Island is Canada’s smallest province. The island wasprimarily colonizedby Scotland, England, and Ireland in the late 1700s, and is part of the ancestral lands of theMi’kmaq, who foraged for wild plants and berries, and fished, especially for eel.

A popular summer coastal destination, PEI’s shores are abundant in wild roses, purple asters, and bright pink spires of fireweed, but refreshingly devoid of vista-blocking resorts. Instead, you’ll find plenty of hayfields and sparsely populated residential towns, rural roads with caution signs for horse-drawn buggies, and chunky, red-capped lighthouses. Architectural styles may have changed since the early 1900s, but the brambly, windswept landscape, which inspired the setting of Lucy Maud Montgomery’s 1908 classicAnne of Green Gables,has not.

According to Ilona Daniel, chef instructor at the Culinary Institute of Canada in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island's “big five” foods are lobster, oysters, beef, potatoes, and mussels. Daniel says the island produces 80 percent of Canada’s mussel harvest, and more than 2 billion pounds of potatoes, including the cult-favorite Irish Cobbler, a creamy, flavorful heirloom variety with a thin, papery skin. PEI also has superb dairy products, thanks to one of the last cooperative dairies in the country.

Sebastian Manago, owner ofDouble Hill Cideryin Caledonia, explains that new projects and changing philosophies over the past 15 years have encouraged islanders to “beat the drums” about these products. It’s not without challenge on an island where the growing season is only a few months long. “There are dozens of young farmers and chefs, but it’s not an easy life,” says Manago. “They really do it as a passion.”

Ask any culinary insider on Prince Edward Island about the roots of the terroir-to-table movement, and they’ll point to Michael Smith, a chef who worked in Michelin-starred restaurants before landing in Souris in 1991 at The Inn at Bay Fortune, on a serene eastern inlet that empties into the Northumberland Strait. Since then, Smith has appeared on multiple Canadian TV programs and authored several cookbooks. In 2013, he and his wife, Chastity, purchased the inn.

The Inn at Bay Fortune’s signature is theFireWorks Feast, a five-hour gastronomic extravaganza that runs nightly from mid-May through mid-October and includes cocktails, garden-set appetizer stations, and a leisurely, family-style dinner prepared by a battalion of chefs and line cooks. The inn’s greenhouse and 10-acre organic farm, where old wooden crates and decommissioned lobster traps are repurposed into growing vessels and decoration, produce 60-to-90 percent of what appears on the menu, depending on the season.

Many of the meal’s sides and garnishes come from Chindamo, the inn’s first full-time forager. He is also the founder ofAn Island Collective, 34-person, twice-annual dinners. Billed as “10 chefs, 10 courses, zero waste,” event participants use all parts of all-PEI foods, whether seafood like Jonah crab; wild-harvested mushrooms; grains from lamb’s quarters—an ancestor to modern quinoa; or acidic coastal gooseberries juiced to create a lemon substitute.

Many of Prince Edward Island’s new epicurean wave have come up through the Culinary Institute of Canada, like Seth Shaw, head chef at two-year-oldMysa Nordic Spa&Resortin St. Peters Bay, just five miles from the dramatic dunes and butterfly-saturated meadows of Greenwich Prince Edward Island National Park. Similar to The Inn at Bay Fortune, Mysa has its own greenhouse and gardens, which produce about 30 percent of the spa restaurant’s ingredients. Shaw jars and ferments some of the garden’s bounty for the colder months, and displays these delicacies in a tall cabinet in the restaurant’s dining room, from curried green tomatoes to pickled cauliflower and fennel, and a range of chutneys, jams, and jellies.

For Shaw, one of the island’s most welcome developments are farm hubs or aggregators, which allow him to order local foods from one place. Now he can more quickly adapt his recipes, which lean toward Mediterranean, presented in a Scandinavian-minimalist style, according to what’s available, and still showcase the island’s finest. “We keep everything natural and fresh, and let the ingredients speak for themselves,” says Shaw.

Apples are perhaps the island’s most plentiful local products—so much so that Manago says, “You can’t let a field go fallow, or apple trees will start growing on it.” The Double Hill team uses 100 percent Prince Edward Island apples to craft products like Oistre, a dry cider aged for two years 20-feet-deep in the sea; Lumina, which is made from a second pressing of apple pomace, the fibrous solids left over from an initial pressing; and earthy, complex Nomad, made entirely from wild-harvested apples.

This year, Double Hill will release its first vintage from their own orchards, which are planted with predominantly French and Spanish cider apples. They will also create a proprietary cider for the Inn at Bay Fortune—an example of what insiders like Shaw refer to as “making our own little scene” on Prince Edward Island.

“PEI is really small, but we do a lot of big things,” says Daniel of the creative ways culinary trendsetters are approaching the island’s farm-to-table foods. “Our size is our strength. It has made us more resilient as people and business owners. And it allows us to have an interconnectedness. We’re telling our story, and telling it well.”

48,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/running-vacations-are-next-big-travel-trend,"Part sport, part pilgrimage, running vacations can reshape how you experience a place—with fresh air, local flavor, and a deeper sense of community.

It’s almost sunset, and the waterfront Műegyetem Wharf is just beginning to stir. The autumn heat, heavy as a weighted blanket, lingers overBudapest, yet a peculiar anticipation hangs in the air as hundreds of people gather for theGenerali Night Run Budapestin late August.

The 13-mile route winds through the Hungarian capital’s heart, taking runners up a 100-meter hill, past the towering Buda Castle, beneath the grand arches of the Chain Bridge, and along the lower embankment, where the illuminated Parliament, Margaret Bridge, and echoing Tunnel unfold like a moving postcard. As the sun bleeds into the Danube, the rhythmic pulse of live bands and the roar of spectators transform the city into a festival of motion and adrenaline, with the night sky as a dramatic backdrop.

Distance running has long been a benchmark of fitness, but it’s also becoming a fascinating way for travelers to explore new destinations.

“I barely prepared—actually, I didn’t run for a month due to an ankle injury,” says Drew Loynes, a Londoner who joined the night run after quitting his tech job last year to travel the world. “I was in places where it was too hot to run or where the roads didn’t feel safe. But running that half marathon in Budapest was an incredible experience and the city easily lends itself to casual running.”

Loynes’ story reflects a growing trend—travelers are increasingly blending fitness with exploration. Hospitality companyAccorpredicts that athletic adventures will be one of 2025’s biggest travel trends, noting a 50 percent rise in searches for “workout holidays” over the past year. As more people seek to achieve personal health goals, recreational sports are becoming an integral part of travel plans.

With run clubs surging in popularity last year, running holidays seem like the natural next step. According to Strava’s 2024 Year in Sportreport, global participation in running clubs jumped by 59 percent in 2024. This momentum has prompted companies likeContikito introduce run club trips later this summer. Designed for 18- to 35-year-olds, their flagship itinerary offers a chance to explore up to 16 European destinations—taking in iconic sites such as the Eiffel Tower and the Colosseum—on foot while fostering social connections in a club-style format.

“Run clubs represent more than a fitness trend for our audience, they’re a way to connect, explore and build community in an increasingly fragmented, online world,” says Contiki chief marketing officer Lottie Norman. “The appetite for active trips is increasing as bookings on our active itineraries surged 105 percent from 2023 to 2024, with group runs emerging as trip highlights.”

Urban landscapes aren’t the only draw, rugged nature is just as enticing. For Liz Gill, founder ofRuncation Travel—a U.S.-based adventure outfit offering guided and self-guided running retreats across Europe and the Americas—hut-to-hut running in the Dolomites in 2016 was a transformative experience.

“It was my biggest week in the mountains at that point,” says the California native, who covered 80 miles and 7,620 meters of elevation gain over seven days.

The following year, Gill introduced the itinerary to her running network, and it remains one of Runcation’s most popular offerings—alongside the alpine landscapes of Mammoth Lakes, a renowned training ground for marathoners on the fringes of Yosemite National Park, and the wild expanses of Argentinian Patagonia; the latter has 15 times the waitlist this year than in winter 2024.

Some of Gill’s most memorable runs have stemmed from personal travels in Cuba’s Viñales region, known for its tobacco farms, and Kenya’s Iten, an unchallenged epicenter of distance running.

“In Viñales, you can jog along rolling dirt roads and still meet locals who’ll happily point you to farms where you can buy a coffee and watchthe sunrise,” she says. “Iten, on the other hand, is all about the community—Olympians and aspiring runners training side by side. I’d head out at 6 a.m. on a Thursday, and the roads would already be buzzing. You could jump into a pack, no matter your level, and join in; one week it might be a fartlek workout, the next something entirely different.”

(Related: Here are 5 places with the most incredible running trails in the world)

Socializing is a major draw for those opting for running holidays. “I love these trips because they get me out of the city and keep me on my toes (literally) in some of the most beautiful places in the world,” says Megha Doshi, a product marketing professional who has joined three of Runcation Travel’s trips—to the Dolomites, Patagonia, and Chamonix.

“Coordinating something like this with friends is nearly impossible—the logistics alone, not to mention finding people who want to explore new places on foot.”

While running is often a solitary activity, those who do it in groups tend to get much more out of the experience—both socially and emotionally. Still, some apprehension is natural.

“It’s human nature to be intimidated by something new, but I’d encourage people to give it a try,” says Gill. “If you live somewhere flat and see an itinerary in the mountains, don’t assume you can’t do it. Reach out for tips, research how to prepare—just because it’s not part of your daily routine doesn’t mean it’s out of reach.”

“Irrespective of travel, running is known to boost cardiovascular and joint health, aid fat loss, improve energy levels, and enhance bone density—potentially preventing osteopenia and osteoporosis,” says doctor Kruti Khemani, an AHPRA-registered sports and musculoskeletal physiotherapist and founder of Mumbai-based Continuum Physiotherapy and Rehab LLP. “It can also improve sleep quality and help you adjust to new time zones faster, easing jet lag.”

Research also shows a strong link between running and mental well-being, with some individuals experiencing a “runner’s high”—a short-lived but intense feeling of euphoria.

According to astudyby David J. Linden, a neuroscience professor at Johns Hopkins University, this post-run bliss is likely due to endocannabinoids, natural compounds in the body similar to cannabis. Unlike endorphins, endocannabinoids cross the blood-brain barrier, promoting relaxation, reduced anxiety, and an overall sense of calm. Other benefits include improved focus, memory, and mood elevation.

(Related: The brain has a secret survival trick to endure a marathon)

“Physical health benefits don’t come overnight, so preparation is key,” advises Khemani. If you're transitioning from running on flat pavements to uneven trails, slopes or rocky surfaces, share the details with a trainer, physiotherapist, or coach to tailor your training. If self-training, start at least six-to-eight weeks in advance, incorporating gym work to strengthen key muscles.

Running long distances increases the risk of repetitive stress injuries (RSI) and acute issues like ankle or ligament strains, especially on unfamiliar terrain. Uphill and downhill stretches can strain the knees, so pacing is crucial. “If unexpected challenges arise, adjust your pace to allow for recovery. Don’t treat it like a marathon,” says Khemani. Warm up, stretch before and after runs, stay hydrated, and carry electrolytes to prevent cramps.

Footwear matters—don’t switch shoes, terrain or distance last minute, or risk injury. Nutrition also plays a role: Hydrate regularly, opt for water and nutrient-rich foods, and avoid dehydrants like alcohol, caffeine, and greasy meals before the runs. “Go low on carbs and high on protein to fuel your runs effectively,” says Khemani.

Gill notes that, compared to other sports or activities, runners love to lounge. Having a comfortable space to relax or access to a massage can make a big difference.

50,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/where-to-eat-ho-chi-minh-city-vietnam,"Fifty years since reunification, the fall of Saigon is a distant memory and microbreweries, cool cafes and Michelin-lauded restaurants are adding another dimension to the city’s eclectic food scene.

I’m on the back of a Vespa, on my way to meet a gangster. Not that I know it yet. Night has descended and rain is slapping the tarmac with a fervent drumming. We’re soaked to the bone as we pull up outside a restaurant called Oc Loan on a small side street in Ho Chi Minh City. Water troughs are set out like street stalls, displaying snails bigger than my fist, plump clams and glistening river prawns. Presiding over them is a man in ripped denim shorts and flip-flops, weighed down by thick gold chains, knuckle dusters and gigantic cuffs. Needless to say, he’s not the maître d’ I’d been expecting.

Inspired by Michelin’s first restaurant guide to Ho Chi Minh, published in 2023, I’m taking a deep dive into the city’s eclectic street-food scene on a scooter tour. “The owner here was a gangster,” says my guide and driver Yen Navi, referring to our bling-laden host as he nods us over to plastic seats. “His wife ran the restaurant first. His gold chains attracted people and that’s how Oc Loan became more and more popular.”

Eating out in Vietnam’s second city is never dull, as I’m beginning to discover. Frontman aside, Oc Loan has serious street cred with local snail- and seafood-lovers. It’s packed, inside and out. Empty clam and mussel shells have been discarded on the spit-and-sawdust floor like cocktail sticks at a Spanish tapas bar. And the dishes that arrive are rustic, with many ingredients plucked from the nearby Mekong Delta. I’m not brave enough for the giant snails but happily tuck into juicy clams in an aromatic lemongrass broth, sizzling barbecued prawns and a platter of soft, smoky scallops with peanuts and spring onions.

Ho Chi Minh — still affectionately called Saigon by most locals — opened a game-changing, Japan-influenced metro line in December last year, but travelling by scooter is still the classic way to see it. On two wheels, we penetrate deep into the sprawling city’s warren of markets, jumping off for jasmine iced tea and banh xeo rice-flour pancakes stuffed with minced pork, Thai basil and potent fish leaf herb. We eat cheek-by-jowl with locals, huddled around wobbly tables under naked bulbs.

There’s one noticeable absence from my gut-busting evening: banh mi, the Vietnamese sandwich that’s risen to international fame in the past decade. The next day, on a tour of the city’s morning food scene, my local guide Jerry Thanh Nghia says, with an American-inflected drawl, that’s because it’s mostly eaten for breakfast. It’s just past 7am when we arrive at a narrow street on the edge of District 1 looking for Bay Ho, a sandwich shop that appeared on Netflix’s Street Food: Asia series in 2019.

“Every 150 metres in Saigon there’s a corner where you can sit to have a meal, drink or dessert. We’re a city of mini food carts,” says Jerry, baseball cap in hand, as we watch a steady stream of motorbikes pull up at the shop. The owner, Ho Quoc Dung, dressed in a Louis Vuitton T-shirt and flip-flops, is serving customers, reaching into a huge wicker basket for stubby baguettes — a staple in Vietnam since the French Indochina era (1857-1954). I watch as he slathers their insides with pig-liver pâté, coriander, pickled radish and chopped pork stained red by a cashew-seed rub.

When it’s our turn, he scoops a bit of the coarse pâté onto a spoon for me to taste. “The secret recipe for the pâté is our biggest asset, passed down from my grandfather,” he explains. It’s unctuous, garlicky and incredibly well seasoned, elevating all the other flavours in the sandwich. In his late thirties, Dung tells me he’s a third-generation chef, getting up at 3am each day with his wife to trawl markets for the freshest coriander and chillies.

Ho Chi Minh’s markets underpin the city’s food culture. And as morning is the best time to experience them, that’s where Jerry and I head next. The smoky scent of meats grilling on earthenware stoves follows our stroll through District 3 towards Vuon Chuoi wet market. Spring rolls are being turned with chopsticks as they fry in deep woks, while shop owners nap on day beds with their doors open. Later that morning, we head to District 5 to visit Chinatown — one of the world’s largest, dating to the 1730s. Here, we enter Thien Hau temple, thought to date to the 18th century, passing under a sky of beehive-shaped incense burners to offer a prayer before one last stop for coffee in Phung Hung market, a five-minute walk away.

Enveloped in a cloud of steam, stall owner Chung Quoc Hung starts by adding a glug of condensed milk to the bottom of our small glasses, as is tradition in Vietnam. He then pours our brews directly from a thin-weave cotton filter he’s pulled from a clay pot. This technique is called ‘racket coffee’, and Chung’s family have perfected the art of making this exceptionally smooth drink at Café Ba Lù over 70 years. I balance on a small plastic stool next to his simple cart, sipping my coffee. It’s powerful and tooth-crackingly sweet thanks to the canned milk.

Vietnam is now the world’s second-biggest producer of coffee, which was first planted by the French. “They tried to bring cows here to create dairy farms in the early 1900s, but the cows didn’t do well in the tropical heat,” says Jerry, explaining why condensed milk became the go-to for working-class locals who bought into France’s coffee-drinking fashions, but couldn’t afford fresh milk.

“Now in Vietnam, people experiment with coffee — some use butter, some use chocolate powder, some even use fish sauce,” says Nguyen Tran Anh, a young barista who I join later that day for a coffee-making workshop. We’re in Ho Chi Minh’s old French quarter, in the eaves of a traditional shop converted into a coffee house called Lacàph. Below us, fashionable Vietnamese dressed in the neutral colours and tailored linens of chic Tokyo denizens are sipping cold brews in brick-lined rooms. It’s a sign of the times in this progressive city, where Japan’s cultural influence can increasingly be felt on the streets.

I’m here to try my hand at making egg coffee, another Vietnamese phenomenon, where the milk is substituted with egg yolks for creaminess and whites for froth. At a workbench set up like a science lab, Anh — in a leather-trimmed apron and Breton-style top — and I busy ourselves with mini electric whisks, weighing scales and drip filters, as she educates me on Vietnam’s evolving tastes.

When we’re done, the concoction before me looks like a baby Guinness cocktail, with a generous golden top. “First we’re going to take a spoon and try the cream, like eating a dessert,” instructs Anh. “Then another spoon with egg cream and coffee together, and then lastly you can stir it up and drink it like a cappuccino.” It’s rich, silky-smooth and laced with coffee blossom honey from the arabica flower.

Dinner that evening is even more decadent. I struggle to find the understated, pitch-black entrance to Nén Light, a contemporary restaurant whose Vietnamese co-founders have been influenced by their time living in Japan as students. Within a year of opening, executive chef Summer Le’s food was endorsed by the Michelin Guide, which lauded the restaurant for its immersive tasting menus. Its sister restaurant in Da Nang was awarded Vietnam’s only Michelin Green star.

“It’s very exciting that Michelin has come to Vietnam,” says Sena Le, Nén’s ‘chief storyteller’, as he leads me through a Japanese rock garden and into a dark dining room. “Vietnamese cuisine possesses something really unique. We’re trying to bring our cuisine, and Vietnam in general, to the world. I believe we’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.”

As the nine-course meal unfolds, ingredients from across the country are wheeled out for inspection — gnarled Buddha’s hand fruit, dried osmanthus flower and young glutinous rice flakes among them. Eventually we come to the melo melo — the same giant snail that I wasn’t brave enough to try at Oc Loan on my Vespa tour. Its raw tiger-striped flesh is served as sashimi. It’s meaty and somewhat chewy but with a natural sweetness akin to a prawn. Two days ago, I didn’t think twice about rejecting this local delicacy. But having now experienced Ho Chi Minh’s passion for food, this is a final culinary leap I’m happy to take.

51,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/plan-the-ultimate-adventure-along-danube-river,"Whether biking to castles or kayaking through gorges, a trip centred on this river is the epitome of European romance.

The Danube touches deep. Its landscapes are lyrical, its cities were built high and mighty by once-great empires, its history is as old as European civilisation itself. In 1866, Johann Strauss II extolled its beauty in The Blue Danube. And in 2025, on the 200th anniversary of the Austrian composer’s birth, his ever-popular waltz still captures the sprightly soul of the river, which flows from the Black Forest in Germany to the Black Sea in Romania and Ukraine. Whether seen in the mist of winter or summer’s first light, there’s poetry in these waters.

But where to begin? Many tours zoom in on the classic sights necklacing the Upper Danube between Germany and Hungary. The knockout is the 24-mile Wachau Valley in Upper Austria, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, where the river lopes past orchards and terraced vineyards, perched abbeys and medieval forts. It’s lovely, no doubt, as are the capitals that follow — Vienna, with its opulent Habsburg palaces, and Budapest, home to art nouveau thermal bathhouses. Cruises are a popular option, but if you want to explore independently, it’s also possible to hike along a network of well-developed trails, or pedal on the Danube Cycle Path, which rolls from the river’s source to its delta.

Venture east, and you’ll be rewarded with treasures fewer people experience. Croatia’s section of the river has wonders like Tvrđa, a star-shaped, 18th-century fortress, and Kopački Rit Nature Park, a floodplain where waterways meet, attracting birdlife from white-tailed eagles to black storks. In Serbia, the Danube flows past the cliff-hugging Golubac Fortress, the fjord-like Iron Gates gorge and Lepenski Vir, Europe’s oldest planned settlement.

All this is the drum roll for the moment when the river takes a final bow at the Danube Delta, a delicate fretwork of marshes, canals and islands. Your eyes will constantly flit between water and sky to spot pelicans, ibises and the brilliant blue flash of kingfishers.

Give yourself plenty of time, as you can’t hurry this river. The longer you stay and further you explore, the more its ever-changing moods, lights, flavours and backdrops will sweep you off your feet, with all the easy grace of Strauss’s famous waltz.

Start point:PassauEnd point:ViennaDistance travelled:208 milesAverage duration:10 days

The river reveals itself in all its glory in this gentle section of the Danube Cycle Path in the Upper Danube. The trail follows the riverbank through Germany and Austria, tracing each elegant bend through woods, farmland and flower-freckled meadows. You’ll find something to make you want to hop out of the saddle almost constantly — from giddy viewpoints to Trappist monasteries; from art galleries to some of Austria’s finest heurigen (rustic wine taverns serving citrusy, mineral Grüner Veltliner and Riesling whites).

The route is bookended by two grand cities. It starts in Passau, which has a baroque old town and was once the largest bishopric in the Holy Roman Empire. Vienna is a fitting climax, with its collection of grand palaces, galleries, concert halls and coffee houses. While the ride itself takes around a week, set aside 10 days to also explore these gateways at leisure.

There are many memorable moments along the way, but the Wachau Valley, which covers the second half of this itinerary, is particularly popular. Here, the Danube flows past medieval castles and baroque abbeys, vineyards and orchards. The latter are pinkened with blossom in spring, and heavy with apricots in summer.

The ride covers between 25 and 44 miles a day, equating to around three to four hours in the saddle, on mostly flat terrain. Take it at a gentle pace; this is a ride to relish, not rush.

Found after crossing from Germany into Austria, this oxbow is hands-down one of the most photogenic stretches of the Danube Valley. It ramps up the scenic drama tenfold: here, the river forms a perfect 180-degree bend as it snakes through granite hills green with pine and oak. It’s impressive from the saddle, but for ringside views, hike half an hour up the slopes to the Schlögener Blick viewpoint. Back by the banks, cross the river by ferry to continue along the path.

In stark contrast to many of the quaint, baroque towns on this ride, thisfinger-on-the-pulse citypropels you into the 21st century. Visit theArs Electronica Center, which showcases new technology, science and digital media via interactive exhibitions, and theLentos gallery, which homes in on contemporary art. Exhibitions often draw on the permanent collection, which harbours works by Austrian artists like Klimt, Kokoschka and Schiele.

Tucked into the folds of forested hills, this mellow little town reclines on a lovely sweep of the river. It’s topped by a baroque, turretedcastlethat looks like it’s been plucked from a children’s bedtime story; its arcaded inner courtyard, dating from the late Renaissance, is a beauty. The town hall houses an18th-century theatre, Austria’s oldest still in operation. Performances are in German, but visitors can see the building on guided tours of the town.

For many cyclists, the city of Melk is the ride’s cultural highlight. Perched sky-high on a hill above the river, itsBenedictine Abbeylifts gazes and spirits with its vast, lemon-and-white-striped facade, twin spires and bauble dome. A visit whisks you around the baroque abbey church and lavishly frescoed Marble Hall, which served as a dining room for the imperial family and distinguished guests.

Set atop a rock and enveloped in greenery, the medieval ruinedcastle of Dürnsteinis one of the most dashing in the Wachau Valley. Word has it that Richard the Lionheart was imprisoned here for a year in the late 12th century, after offending the Duke of Austria, Leopold V. From Dürnstein town, you can stomp to the castle in around half an hour, visit for free and enjoy the panoramic views.

With pretty gardens, river beaches and vestiges of Roman rule, this town would merit a stop even if it weren’t for its claim to fame as the home of one of Austria’s most famous artists, expressionist Egon Schiele. Most visitors stop here to dive into its two dedicated museums — one set inthe housewhere Schiele was born, the other showcasing hisemotive artin a former jail near the Danube.

Start point:LembergEnd point:BeuronDistance travelled:35 milesAverage duration:Four days

Close to where the river springs up in Germany’s Black Forest, the Upper Danube Valley is the stuff of Romantic painter dreams, but it receives just a trickle of the visitors you’ll find further east. The best way to see it is by lacing up boots on the Donauberglandweg (‘Danube highland trail’), a moderately challenging, easy-to-navigate, four-day trek through Germany’s Swabian Jura mountain range. The Danube — still narrow this close to the source — is your near-constant companion as you head up karst peaks and across beautiful juniper heathland.

The itinerary starts on Lemberg mountain, near the town of Gosheim, and finishes in the village of Beuron, but with a week to spare it’s worth tacking on a couple of days to explore the bigger towns in the area. Tuttlingen, near Gosheim, on the banks of the Danube, is crowned by the ruins of 15th-century Burg Honberg fortress. Sigmaringen, to the east of Beuron, has red-roofed, gabled houses, topped off by a palace once owned by the powerful Hohenzollern dynasty.

You’ll do four-and-a-half to six hours of walking each day, passing numerous towns and villages. Bring binoculars for a chance of sighting chamois, eagle owls and falcons.

The trail begins on a literal high at Lemberg, the loftiest point in the Swabian Jura at 3,330ft. The Bära river, a tributary of the Danube, springs up at the foot of this densely wooded mountain. Traces of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture have been unearthed here, but it’s the view from the 12-floor, steel-lattice observation tower that’s the real draw. On cloud-free days, it reaches beyond the Black Forest to the German and Swiss Alps.

On the southwestern cusp of the Swabian Jura, this 3,231ft peak affords similarly arresting views. At the top, the powder-puff pink, onion-domed pilgrimage chapel is a baroque beauty. Visit thechurch, then go for a drink in the tavern’s beer garden, whose terrace overlooks a patchwork quilt of meadow, fell and forest.

Rising above the town of Böttingen, 3,215ft Alter Berg is dubbed the ‘Old Mountain’ with good reason — the Celts were already here over 6,000 years ago. The landscape feels suitably ancient, with juniper heaths, gold grasslands, stone ridges, forests and hedges. A Way of the Cross (short trails featuring images from Jesus’s crucifixion) leads to the top.

Hugging the banks of the Danube, this town, with its gate towers, cobbles and gables, seems plucked from a Grimm fairytale. It grew in prominence in the Middle Ages, when it came under the thumb of the royal Hohenzollern family. Its biggest attention-grabber is its castle, built in around 1200 for the Lords of Enzberg and reconstructed in the 18th century, crowned by two baroque onion domes.

The Upper Danube Valley feels especially adventurous around this town. The trail heads up and down rocky ridges to eyrie-like lookouts atop limestone crags — honeycombed with caves — that tumble down to the grey-green river. Head to the viewpoints of Laibfelsen and Stiegelesfels, and stop off at the riversideZiegelhütte Fridingen, a self-service snack bar and beer garden, for a drink.

The hike ends on a cultural high in Beuron. Your gaze will be drawn to the vast facade of its massive working Benedictine abbey, which is among Germany’s oldest (its monastic origins date to 1077). While the abbey is off limits, the ornate baroque church — a riot of stucco, marble and frescoes — is well worth a visit. beuron.de

52,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/where-travel-june-best-destinations,"Don a floral crown for springtime festivities in Sweden or look out for the flame-red fur of orangutans collecting fruit on Borneo’s forest floor — there’s all this and more to explore in the month of June.​

June is the month of plenty. While some parts of the world are braced against hurricanes, monsoons and heat waves, the Northern Hemisphere is in its prime. The southern Med is ripe for striking out on a Croatian sailing tour or crisscrossing the Cyclades, while the Baltic and Nordic countries welcome bright nights and midsummer celebrations.

The dry season starts in safari spots across the globe like Uganda, Tanzania, Borneo and the Peruvian Amazon, making June an ideal time to view the Serengeti’s Great Migration or orangutans swinging through Sabah rainforests.

The comfortable temperatures also afford opportunities for lovers of the great outdoors, including hiking the mountainous Inca Trail or trekking through North America’s national parks for big-sky adventures. In Yosemite, waterfalls are booming and paths push through carpets of wildflowers.

Music City hits a high note this month. Its chock-a-block calendar of music festivals includes the annualBonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. ‘Bonnaroo’ is Creole slang for ‘good stuff’ and there’s heaps of it: over 150 performances, as well as comedy, cinema, interactive art installations, food trucks, yoga and even sustainability workshops. It sprawls across a 700-acre farm on the city’s outskirts, a short shuttle ride from the centre.

While in the South, take a deep dive into country music at the annual four-dayCMA Festin downtown Nashville. Musicians like Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood perform free to help raise funds for the Country Music Association Foundation’s music education programmes.

There’s plenty more to sing about, too, with tons of free music in June.Make Music Nashvilletakes tunes to the streets, sidewalks, breweries, parks and even the airport withlocal artistseach solstice (21 June), while concert seriesMusicians Cornerhits the stage at Centennial Park each weekend in May and the first two weekends in June. Inspired by London’s Speakers’ Corner, this Nashville version was created as both a musical landmark and community gathering space, drawing artists such as Emmylou Harris, Chris Stapleton and Vince Gill.

Daylight stretches into night north of the Arctic Circle this month due to the Earth’s axial tilt. In Swedish Lapland, the sun lingers low on the horizon from June until mid-July, painting the evening sky an ethereal gold. Night owls can try theSwedish Tourist Association'smidnight sun hike in Abisko National Park, which takes trekkers up Nuolja mountain in a chairlift before a climb to the summit, where forests, mountains and an alpine lake glow beyond.While you’re wide-eyed, experience the merriment of Sweden’smidsummerparties. As the fields burst with wildflowers, revellers rush to theirsommarstuga(summer cottage) for the national holiday at the end of June. There’s maypole dancing, flower garland stringing, garden games and a feast of new potatoes, pickled herring and plump strawberries.Dalarna, peppered with green forests and red cottages, is a great spot for traditional celebrations. If you can’t bag an invite, don your floral crown for a three-day festival at Stockholm’s open-airSkansenmuseum.

This ancient city in the lofty Peruvian Andes becomes a stage forInti Raymi, a 500-year-old tradition dating back to the days of the Inca Empire. The Festival of the Sun culminates in a celebration of the benevolent Inca sun god on the winter solstice, marking the beginning of longer days ahead. It involves a procession from Qoricancha that passes through the main square and ends at the ruined Inca citadel of Sacsayhuamán. Salute the sun with a faux llama sacrifice, folk dancing and traditional Peruvian bands.Investigate more Inca heritage on a four-day trek to the 15th-century citadelMachu Picchu, whose legendary ruins dot a rugged mountain slope. June is in the dry season in the Peruvian Highlands, meaning ideal conditions to strike out on the sun-soaked Inca Trail.

Swing into theSabahrainforests for sightings of the increasingly rare orangutan. These rust-red primates are found only in the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo — the latter shared by Indonesia and Malaysia.Borneo is one of the few dry spots in Southeast Asia this month, basking amid warm and humid days. It’s also fruiting season, which coaxes the arboreal apes down from the canopy to feast on the forest floor. Keep your eyes peeled as you head along Sabah’s Kinabatangan River and through the lush Danum Valley.Slow things down on remote Selingan Island, where turtle-hatching season is starting. A pinprick off the northeast Bornean coast, it’s one of three islands that formTurtle Islands National Park, a conservation sanctuary for green and hawksbill turtles since 1977. Only 50 visitor permits per day are issued for Selingan Island, where visitors are highly suggested to stay the night — no bad thing, because as darkness falls, turtles slink ashore to lay eggs in the velvety sand. Guests can also help release turtle hatchlings into the sea.

The island off thePembrokeshirecoast is a wildlife haven, hosting around half the world’s population of manx shearwaters, plus guillemots, razorbills and great cormorants. From April to September, boats slip between Martin’s Haven, on the mainland, and Skomer, but this month is when Atlantic puffin numbers are at their peak. They migrate en masse, waddling along cliff tops pocketed with pink thrift and red sea campion or soaring towards burrows with broad, multicoloured bills bursting with sand eels. Skomer’s offshore rocks and sheltered bays are also visited by dolphins, harbour porpoises and curious grey seals.

For more of the wild west, lace up your hiking boots for the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, a trail tracing 186 miles of coastline, passing soaring, heather-dotted cliffs, sandy coves and salt-licked towns. Flora and fauna are on display this month, with some stretches of the path plied by wild ponies. Adrenaline junkies can try coasteering, a sport invented by surfers in the county in which the foreshore is a playground: ride swells, hop across rocks, explore caves and jump off craggy cliffs.

53,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/carriage-roads-acadia-national-park-maine,"A favorite of cyclists, the park’s historic carriage roads offer 45 miles of woodland that’s free of motor vehicles.

Crushed stone crunches under feet, bike tires, and horse hooves on a late spring day inAcadia National Park. Finally free of snow, the popular carriage roads are open, and visitors inhale the spruce-scented air deeply as they meander along the 8.6-mile Jordan Pond Loop. “My first experience on the carriage roads was when I was growing up in Maine,” says MacKenzie Bowker, a guide forSummer Feet Cycling&Walking. “I loved cycling with my dad on the roads because it was a quiet place to be and the chances to see wildlife were plentiful.”

I’ve hiked hundreds of miles on national park trails in the United States, but have biked in far fewer parks because often the only option is to share crowded roads with vehicles. In Acadia, cyclists can enjoy the serenity of nature away from the noise of cars, and get a little history thrown in for good measure.

Fifty-seven miles of rustic carriage roads—45 miles in Acadia National Park and 12 in theLand&Garden Preserve—were constructed from 1913 to 1940, a gift of philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his family. Today, the carriage roads are the best example of broken-stone roads in the U.S. and beckoned 3.96 million annual park guests in 2024 to walk, bike, ski, snowshoe, and ride in horse-drawn carriages along various connected loops.

(Related: Here's why scientists are studying Maine's coastline.)

Rockefeller designed the 16-foot-wide carriage roads to wind through forests, along ponds, and up mountains, blending them with the natural landscape. The roads were constructed with three layers of rock, stone culverts, wide ditches, and a 6- to 8-inch crown for good drainage. Coping stones—large blocks of granite—line the roads and serve as guardrails.

“Landscape architect Beatrix Ferrand had a home here in Bar Harbor and collaborated with Rockefeller on the vistas and planting design along the carriage roads,” says Lisa Horsch Clark, vice president of development and donor relations forFriends of Acadia(FOA), a nonprofit organization formed in 1986 dedicated to preserving and protecting the national park. An early proponent of native plantings like blueberry and sweet fern, Ferrand chose and placed shrubs and trees to frame views, as well as heal the landscape following the park’s construction.

Rockefeller also financed 16 of the 17 bridges along the roads that span cliffs, roads, streams, and waterfalls. Constructed of steel-reinforced concrete, the bridges utilize native stone on their surfaces, and each of them is unique in design. Two gate lodges, Jordan Pond Gatehouse (now closed) andBrown Mountain Gatehouse, were built to mark the entrance to the carriage road network.

There are eight popular carriage road loops. The shortest is the 4.2-mile Hadlock Loop, which includes three bridges along the way. Ambitious walkers and cyclists can take the 11.3-mile Around the Mountain Loop, which crosses seven bridges.Park mapsshow detailed mileage for the carriage roads, as well as note numbered intersection signposts, so visitors don’t get lost.

(Related: A park ranger's guide to Acadia National Park.)

Maintenance of the carriage road system is a daunting task.Maine’s wet weather plays a major part in washing away surface materials and vegetation growth aids in eroding the roads, ditches, and drainage systems. “An extensive rehabilitation of the roads took place 30 years ago, from 1992 to 1995, and combined federal construction funds with matching funds from Friends of Acadia,” says Perrin Doniger, FOA vice president of communications and marketing. “The organization established an endowment to help protect the carriage roads in perpetuity, creating the first endowed trail system in the United States.”

The endowment enables more than $200,000 annually to be used by the park for carriage road maintenance and is combined with a portion of park user fees as well as federal funding for additional upkeep. Among these projects is the management of 182 historic vistas throughout the carriage road network, ensuring that they remain as close as possible to their original scale.

Each year, FOA volunteers contribute thousands of hours to carriage road restoration tasks, especially clearing leaves from culverts and ditches to maintain drainage and weeding vegetation that grows between the coping stones. “Because the stones are nicknamed ‘Rockefeller’s teeth,’ we call it flossing instead of weeding,” says Nikki Burtis, FOA stewardship coordinator.

Visitors can participate in the half-dayDrop-in Stewardship Volunteer Program, helping on maintenance projects offered every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from June through the end of October. OnTake Pride in Acadia Day, the first Saturday of November, up to 400 volunteers “put the carriage roads to bed” in preparation for winter.

The lack of automobiles appeals to users of Acadia National Park’s carriage roads forhiking, exploring via motorized wheelchair,bicycling(including class-one e-bikes),horseback riding, traveling in ahorse-drawn carriage, and cross-country skiing or snowshoeing inwinter. Pets are welcome on leashes no longer than 6 feet.

“It’s important that visitors have a plan before heading to the park to experience the carriage roads,” says Amanda Pollock, public affairs office for Acadia National Park. “A lot of our parking lots and access roads can fill up early in the day, especially during the peak summer season. And the roads are closed during mud season—times when soft conditions can aid erosion.”

Visitors can bring their bike or rent from a local outfitter. The fare-freeIsland Exploreroffers a van with a bike trailer on a seasonal basis between Bar Harbor and the Eagle Lake Carriage Road Entrance.MDI Wheelersprovides rides on special electric-assist trikes for people who need assistance. Guided cycling trips are available from outfitters like Summer Feet, which has itineraries that range from weekend to weeklong as well as self-guided trips.

Norman Patry, the “Big Toe” of Summer Feet, incorporated Acadia’s carriage roads into his tours 25 years ago, when he founded the company. “They are a wonderful meeting of design and the natural landscape,” he says. “There’s so much richness between the rocks, trees, lichen, and moss that I’m always dazzled whenever I’m riding.”

54,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/overcome-jet-lag-with-expert-tips,"From strategically timed naps and caffeine to high-tech gadgets, these expert tips will help your body adjust to a new time zone.

Hop a plane across several time zones, and you may end up with what scientists call circadian dysrhythmia (aka jet lag). It’s a temporary sleep disorder where your body’s internal clock isn’t in sync with the time cues in your destination—daylight, dark of night, mealtimes.

It’s also why you might doze off at lunch on your first day inLondonor be unable to get to sleep the first couple of nights of a vacation toJapan. “We have a natural rhythm to our bodies, and it’s pretty well set,” saysVivek Jain, director of the George Washington University’sCenter for Sleep Disorders.

But jet lag doesn’t have to wreck your trip. “If you plan for it, you can do most of your acclimatizing to your destination a few days in advance,” says W. Chris Winter, neurologist and author ofThe Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How to Fix It.

Arecent studyconfirmed what many travelers already suspected: Going from west to east can be tougher to adjust to than the other way around. So, planning ahead is key to curbing jet lag. You can also use light exposure, sleep, strategically timed naps, and caffeine. Recent scientific innovations, from high-tech gadgets to safer pharmaceuticals, might be worth adding to your anti-jet lag arsenal, too.Here’s what the experts suggest to help you adjust to a new time in no time.

Try to book a flight that lands during the day, since getting out into sunlight helps reset your body clock. “It jump starts you much more quickly,” saysLuxembourg-based sleep coachChristine Hansen.

If it’s morning or early afternoon when your plane lands, a jolt of caffeine can help you acclimatize. So can eating breakfast at the standard time in your destination. But you might want to forgo thatcacio pepefettuccini dinner your first couple of nights in Rome; the study published in Chaos found that skipping your evening meal while filling up at breakfast produced the quickest adjustments to subjects’ circadian rhythms.

Blocking out light is key to getting sleep on the plane (a proven jet lag antidote on overnight flights). If your destination is several hours ahead, wear sunglasses until you’re ready to snooze, then strap on a sleeping mask. When your brain senses darkness, it starts to produce melatonin, the chemical that initiates sleep.

A2021 German studyfound that worrying about having jet lag made it worse. So, if you believe a certain routine or item will help you drift off, it might just work.

Use whatever tools you can to make your trip more pleasant and silent. “Basically, anything you can do to get comfortable enough to sleep can have a very strong placebo effect,” saysJamie M. Zeitzer, co-director of Stanford University’s Center for Sleep and Circadian Sciences.

That could mean a pillow such as theSleeper Hold, securely attaches to the seat-back or headrest to solve bobblehead and also blocks out light with a secure eye mask. Other pillow options are the traditional C-shape one or a wraparound model such as theTrtlorOstrich, which resemble padded neck scarves and offer 360-degree head support. Also worth a test run: an airplane foot hammock (hook it underneath the seat in front of you) designed to relieve pressure on your legs and back during a long flight.Add noise-canceling headphones or earplugs to set the stage for slumber. Silicone earplugs, which you mold to form a seal over your earholes, are more comfortable than old-school foam ones.

Taking melatonin, which is also made naturally by the body, can help you doze off in the air or in a new time zone. Melatonin is available over the counter, but experts recommend consulting your health care provider before use. Unlike a prescription sleep drug, it won’t sedate you for hours.Experts are mixed on using drugs to knock yourself out on a flight—or to quell insomnia once you’ve arrived. Sleeping pills are available over-the-counter (ZzzQuil, Unisom, etc., which work using the antihistamine doxylamine succinate) or prescription-only Zolpidem (Ambien, Edluar, Intermezzo), which is a sedative or hypnotic.

Both types of drugs carry risks of mental impairment and grogginess—particularly if taken with booze, as some travelers do, against prescription warnings. Zolpidem can be addictive if used regularly. “But I don’t think Ambien is bad if people take it as prescribed,” says Zeitzer. “It’s worse to have anxiety keep you from sleeping and having that ruin your trip.”

A newer class of insomnia drugs, dualorexin receptor antagonists(DORAs like Belsomra, Dayvio, Quviviq), block the receptor in your brain that helps you maintain wakefulness, especially in the evening. Unlike sedatives, DORAs don’t force you into unconsciousness and aren’t considered addictive, so researchers believe the sleep they provide is much closer to normal.

You can minimize jet lag by adjusting your bedtime, light exposure, and caffeine intake a few days before your trip. Smartphone appsTimeshifterandStopJetLaggenerate personalized pre-travel schedules and give tips on the best times of day to fly.

TheLumos Smart Sleep Maskis a tool travelers can use to help them “pre-adjust” to new time zones. Developed using Zeitzer’s research, it emits targeted flashes of low-intensity light while you snooze. You use it the night before a flight and the first night in your destination. This reportedly shifts your internal clock forward three to four hours a night (as opposed to the usual one hour per day).

55,National Geographic,Travel,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/alpine-spa-town-bad-gastein-austria-hohe-tauern-alps,"Deep in Austria’s Hohe Tauern Alps, the spa town of Bad Gastein has long been eulogised for the healing power of its mountain waters. Visit today to enjoy them in all their forms, be it a dip in a glacial lake or a luxurious spa session.

Morning light creeps over central Austria’s Hohe Tauern Alps, spotlighting summits one by one. As our yoga group launches into asanas, the valley below is bathed gold. There can be few lovelier spots to practise sun salutations than here, on a platform high in the forest of Bad Gastein, with a ringside seat of the mountains and within earshot of the town’s waterfall. “It’s a magical place,” says Annette Söhnlein, smiling as radiant as the new day.

She’s leading a class at Haus Hirt, the Alpine-chic lodge where I’m staying for the week. Once a refuge for writers like Stefan Zweig and Thomas Mann, the 1920s building was redesigned in 2000, with contemporary art and rooms designed to frame the view. “Here in the embrace of tall trees, every breath is filled with mountain air,” says Annette. “Our senses are awakened by the mountains and vast sky, and the sound of the nearby waterfall.”

The 1,119ft-high, mist-cloaked waterfall is as if God whipped the plug out: the torrent rages through forest and dives over ragged cliffs into three turquoise pools as it plunges into town, splitting it in two. Its source is ice melt from Hohe Tauern National Park, Austria’s first and biggest, spreading 717sq miles across the country’s highest peaks and glaciers. The water rolls down the mountains, through gorges and streams, reaching Bad Gastein in its purest form.

Over 3,000 years, this mineral-rich water has also filtered through rock. Five million litres of it bubble to the surface every day at 17 thermal springs, at temperatures between 44C and 47C. Romans, emperors, aristocrats, artists — all dunked in these waters over the centuries seeking a cure for their ailments.

The water made Bad Gastein’s fortunes, as reflected in its architecture. Chandelier-lit, marble-clad belle époque villas cling to the town’s sheer, wooded rock faces, like a miniature Vienna transposed onto the wildest of Alpine backdrops. For a while, with taking the waters no longer in fashion, the resort slipped into anonymity. But recently, interest in one of Austria’s most unique spa towns has surged. Hotels are again tapping into the waters, from Haus Hirt to the recently revamped Straubinger, with its rooftop infinity pool, and the Cōmodo, which offers bespoke treatments.

But this is first and foremost an Alpine resort, and the mountains tearing across the horizon entice me to head higher. I take the cable car up to 7,220ft Stubnerkogel, where hikers proceed like tightrope walkers on a 450ft-long hanging bridge that rocks in the breeze between the station and a transmission tower. A five-minute walk away, a viewing platform juts out into the void, peering over to glacier-tipped Grossglockner, Austria’s highest peak at 3,798m (12,460ft). I head off on a four-hour hike to the nearby resort of Sportgastein, up and over scree fields, wildflower-sprinkled pastures and rocky passes.

The water is ice cold at Bockhartsee, an ink-blue lake cradled by mountains along the way, but I brave a quick, heart-stopping dip. Gold was once mined around this high body of water. Then — legend has it — a dragon covered it in ice and the treasures sank, forever gone.

But there was gold elsewhere. A couple of miles up the valley from Bad Gastein, Radhausberg mountain in the village of Böckstein was the El Dorado of the Alps to medieval miners. By the 17th century, the practice ceased, the ore veins depleted. But the caves were reopened in the 1940s in the hope of discovering rich gold deposits.

Instead, something curious happened: miners emerged from the caves considerably healthier than when they entered. Bad backs, coughs and colds, rashes and rheumatism — all are said to have magically disappeared. The secret? Radon, seeping through the rock fissures and cracks in small, safe quantities, widely believed to boost the immune system.

The mines are now the Gasteiner Heilstollen health centre. On a visit, I get my blood pressure checked, strip to my bathing suit, pop on a bathrobe and board a little yellow train chugging to a chamber deep in the bowels of the mountain. I’m allotted a lounger and sit in silence with strangers as the hammam-like heat of around 40C gradually intensifies. I’m there for an hour, but a minimum two-week treatment plan is needed to reap real benefits, I’m told.

Still, I make the most of my stay in Bad Gastein and, back at Haus Hirt, head to the spa. “I’m going to leave you to relax here,” says Evelyn Ikrath, who grew up in the resort and now manages the hotel with architect husband Ike. She ushers me into a dimly lit chamber, where a sunken bath is filled with radon-rich thermal water. “You might feel a little lightheaded when you get out.”

Actually, I feel as though I’m drifting on air, with a pleasant heat that penetrates to my core. I wrap up in a bathrobe and watch the valley fall into shadow. Opting for a pack of mineral-rich mud, I’m then slathered in the stuff, wrapped up cocoon-like and left to float on a waterbed.

By the time I leave the spa to dress for dinner, the first stars are blinking in the sky. I can no longer see the waterfall, but as I push open my balcony door and peer out into the night, I can hear its flow. Now, as always in Bad Gastein, everything comes back to water. And what special water it is.

56,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/article/starling-birds-flock-cloud,"For centuries, researchers have pondered how starlings travel in those gorgeous shape-shifting clouds. The answers continue to surprise them.

On winter eveningsthroughout much of Europe and North America, an hour before sunset, thousands ofstarlingsgather in the skies. Before descending to their nighttime roosts, the birds put on one of nature’s most spectacular displays. They pulse, ripple, and wheel as if they were a single entity—an amorphous, shape-shifting creature with the delicate beauty of calligraphic brushstrokes and the erratic chaos of flickering flames.

How could so many birds be so tightly coordinated? That’s a mystery that researchers have sought to solve for more than a century. In 1931, the ornithologist Edmund Selous argued that a starling murmuration, which he described as “a madness in the sky,” could only arise through telepathy. The birds “must think collectively, all at the same time,” he wrote. Like many others, Selous assumed that complex behavior must have equally complex origins. But in the 1980s, programmers and physicists started showing otherwise. They created computer models in which virtual individuals interacted according to deceptively simple rules but nonetheless moved in ways that resembled coordinated flocks. These simulations were compelling, but researchers lacked good data on actual flocks to compare them against. Then, in 2005, a team led by married physicists Andrea Cavagna and Irene Giardina in Rome took a giant leap forward. Over many chilly evenings across three years, they climbed to the rooftop of the Palazzo Massimo to photograph the city’s especially epic murmurations with pairs of cameras. Using these images, they reconstructed the 3D position of each individual in murmurations that included more than 4,000 members.

(Starling murmurations are dazzling, ubiquitous, and puzzling.)

The team has learned that no matter how large the flock, each starling interacts with only seven neighbors, which might be as much as their brains can handle. The exact neighbors change from second to second, but the starlings don’t track these shifting alliances. They merely fly in the same direction as whichever seven birds are nearest, while staying close but not too close. Alignment, attraction, and avoidance: By plugging this trio of rules into a computer model, along with some basic aerodynamics, Charlotte Hemelrijk from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands created a virtual murmuration that resembled the real deal—and matched the data from Rome.

This showed that the starlings need no overarching plan, no leader, and no telepathic hive mind. They barely need to communicate at all. Through the simplest of interactions, playing out over distances of a few feet, the breathtaking, sky-spanning complexity of a murmuration emerges.

Over the past two decades, the data from Rome have continued to reveal surprises. When a starling turns, its new alignment should influence its neighbors, and their neighbors, and so on. But you’d expect that mistakes would slowly creep in and the new directions would get lost, much as in the children’s game of telephone. In fact, errors aren’t magnified by the birds’ movements, but washed away. The flock shows what physicists call scale-free correlations, which “is like a game of telephone where information always arrives at the end, uncorrupted,” Giardina told me. This means that no matter how big the aerial display gets, the movement of each bird affects and is affected by all the others. If one turns, they all turn. Each starling is paying attention to only seven others, but its senses effectively extend across the entire flock, and it can respond to events occurring hundreds of birds away. This is why the flock looks like a single entity: It really does behave like one.

(These birds flock in mesmerizing swarms of thousands—but why is still a mystery.)

Buoyed by these discoveries, researchers have become increasingly ambitious and creative in their quest to understand the details behind murmurations. Hemelrijk and colleagues including Rolf Storms and Marina Papadopoulou have been studying the starlings’ evasive maneuvers by lunging at them with a robot designed to look like a peregrine falcon. “You can’t go into the field and wait for a predator to attack, which might happen one day in two months,” Papadopoulou told me. “The robot fixes that problem.” Using footage from the fauxlcon, she is cataloging maneuvers like the flash expansion, where the flock scatters outward, or the vacuole, where a hole forms within the birds. She’s trying to understand how the patterns arise depending on the falcon’s behavior, the flock’s prior formations, or actions of individual starlings.

Researchers also want to follow flocks over long periods. The Rome data were collected with fixed cameras that photographed the starlings only if they flew into view. As Papadopoulou says, “The flock might be spelling your name outside the frame, but you’re not collecting that data.” Giardina’s colleagues have solved the problem with a new network of rotating cameras that can follow the flocks. Now they just need the starlings.

“Unfortunately, there are much fewer flocks now,” Giardina told me. “Last year was a disaster.” She doesn’t know why Rome’s starlings have declined. The city sees them as a nuisance and employs flashing lights and bullhorns to disperse them. But starlings are also disappearing throughout the rest of their native range. British populations have more than halved in the past 60 years, while Danish numbers have dwindled by 60 percent. Søren Solkær, who took the photographs on these pages, says, “In the past two or three years, I’ve had a very hard time locating very large flocks.” It’s not just starlings either: Within the same time frame, Europe and North America have lost 550 million and 2.9 billion birds, respectively, due to habitat loss and other human-driven causes. On both continents, the commonest birds have suffered some of the greatest losses.

Starlings illustrate the stakes of this decline. They remind us that it is not enough for a species to avoid extinction and merely exist. It must thrive and teem, for many of Earth’s most beautiful phenomena only emerge when living things act together in great numbers, whether that’s a flock of starlings or the network of neurons in the people watching them. “When witnessing a starling murmuration,” Solkær says, “the external phenomenon seems to mirror something inside myself, illuminating the universal bond we have with nature.”

Periods of timelasting thousands, millions, or even billions of years might seem unfathomable. So Mark Chen, a photographer and teacher in Houston, decided to “visualize this very mysterious idea of deep time” in more relatable terms: the stars over our heads andthe rocksunderfoot. Since 2022, he’s been hiking into wild places, including national parks, at night and deploying a custom-made projector to layer NASA images ofstar systemsonto iconic natural formations in split-second bursts. Each resulting photograph features an earthly setting roughly as old, in years, as the stars’ distance from Earth in light-years. This blend of geological and galactic perspectives, capturing “how our planet has coexisted with the universe,” is now part of an ongoing series he calls Pilgrimage of Light. By comparison, we humans have been here for only a flash.

Twenty million years ago, subterranean pressure raised the gigantic limestone formations that house today’sCarlsbad Caverns, juxtaposed here with the spiral arms of the Pinwheel galaxy 22.3 million light-years away.

58,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/how-to-photograph-the-stars,"From basic techniques to the kit you need, plus where to go to capture the best pictures, here’s how to get started in astrophotography.

There’s something extraordinary about gazing up at a star-filled sky — a reminder of how small we are in the grander scheme of things. From wilderness glamping to geodesic domes that allow us to lie wide-eyed under a canopy of stars, there are myriad ways to take in the beauty of the night sky. But while seeing with your own eyes is one thing, trying to photograph a dark sky can be challenging. Spontaneously grabbing for your phone on a suddenly clear night might be a thrill for some, but careful pre-planning is what will maximise the chances of getting a close-to-perfect shot. And, once you get into the swing of astrophotography, it might become your next hobby — just choose a location, check the weather and you never know what you might capture.

Just likephotographing the Northern Lights, you need to consider keeping the camera still, increasing the ISO, opening the shutter for a longer exposure (a few seconds usually) and having a wide aperture and a lens that can take in the enormity of the view. You might want to go all out with a high-end mirrorless or DSLR set up, though intuitive night mode and AI on most recent smartphones has made low-light photography that much easier.

Using a tripodWhichever camera system you use, you’ll need something to reduce camera shake, whether that’s a tripod or other stabilisation. If you don’t have anything to hand, balance your camera somewhere and use the timer to avoid blurry shots.

Lens choicesThe wider the lens, the bigger the sky will appear, but if you have a fabulous focal point such as a perfect tree or mountain arch, framing the Milky Way over the top of it might require something closer, so play around with what you have — and don’t be afraid to shoot vertically. It’s good to get to your location early to check out the lay of the land — it’s hard to figure out composition in complete darkness. If you can’t do this, use your head torch to shed some light on the scene but be mindful of other astrophotographers and stargazers.

Using your phoneThough it’s electric light pollution in big cities that prevents us from fully seeing the night sky, it’s technology itself that has allowed us to really capture it. Switching on night mode, the camera will automatically adjust for a longer exposure and higher ISO. Stargazing appslikePhotoPillsandNight Skyare perfect for aiming your phone at the celestial heavens and planning where to be, and when. Most phones also allow for ‘professional mode’ where you can adjust the camera settings just like on a DSLR camera.

Travel smart and stay safeThough you don’t need to stay out all night to capture the stars, you’ll likely have to go somewhere elevated, remote or isolated, so plan ahead and travel safe. As soon as the sun drops in desert locations, the temperature goes with it, so don’t get caught out without warm clothes or decent footwear. A head torch is advisable, and one that glows red will ensure you keep your night vision intact while helping you to check the dials and illuminate your footing.

(A practical guide to stargazing.)

The best skies for astrophotography are the driest, clearest ones, so it’s no surprise to know that deserts and remote spots will favour you with the right conditions. The IDA — orInternational Dark-Sky Association— is a great place to start, listing designated dark places in 22 countries on six continents, while encouraging communities to protect their environment through low-glare street lighting and other measures.

USAThe Great Western Starry Wayin the US links several key locations, all of which offer the kind of arid climate and elevation that makes astrophotography possible. Utah is undoubtedly a dramatic destination with epic topography, which will provide a focal point to your night sky images. Compose stunning shots at the Natural Bridges National Monument, named as the first IDA Dark Sky Park in 2007, while you spot constellations and hope for a shooting star.

Arizona has some of the best stargazing spots in the world, too, with 20 designated areas, from the Grand Canyon in the north to the southern Sonoran Desert. In fact, Flagstaff became the first-ever Dark Sky City in 2001, and the Lowell Observatory is where Pluto was first discovered. There’s a new astronomy discovery centre there with an open-air rooftop planetarium. Travellers can gaze fully at the night sky from their own bed thanks to luxury eco-resorts, glass skylights and atriums — there’s even a dormitory option at theobservatorynear Tucson if you want to pull an all-nighter.

AustraliaSimilarly, with dry weather and long summers, Western Australia has spectacular stargazing options and the clearest night skies. Head into the Outback or plan aroad tripwith astrophotography as your guiding light. From the Kimberley in the north (make sure you visit in the dry season) to the Coral Coast, you’re never far from seeing the Milky Way and the Southern Cross.Perth Observatoryputs on special astrophotography events, while theGravity Discovery Centre, north of the capital, has guided star walks under a mind-blowingly ink-dark sky.

ChileChile’s Elqui Valley, north of Santiago, is famed for its rain-free clear skies, low light pollution and plethora of observatories —Observatorio Cerro Mamallucahas telescopes and offers talks to introduce keen astronomers to skygazing. With the town of Vicuña as your base, head out to see wide open landscapes and distant Andean peaks and structures.

EuropeIsland settings work well for photographing the stars, surrounded as they are by dark oceans and providing natural landscapes and rocky outcrops to add interest to your composition. The Isle of Wight off the UK’s south coast has low-rise architecture, lighthouses and sea stacks like the Needles as foreground interest. La Palma in the Canary Islands has adedicated astrotourism programme,too, as well as the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory.

Remote wilderness are also among the best to visit for stunning images. Bodmin Moor in Cornwall in the UK isa Dark Sky parkand an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Its granite moorland is designated for conservation and it’s the first AONB to receive IDA accreditation, while Dartmoor in Devon is similarly untouched, offering moorland, forest and rock formations that will add structure to your images.

59,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/last-reindeer-canada-inuvialuit,"Their unusual story began about a hundred years ago. Now, as they head to the high north, an ambitious new chapter is being written.

Beneath the glow of the morning sun,thousands of reindeer plod across the frozen far reaches of northwestern Canada. In the slow-moving scrum, the animals’ bodies almost disappear under a cloud of vapor as warm breath collides with cold air. A forest of antlers seems to dance in the mist. Glimpsed from afar, the migrating herd looks like one long, sinuous streak of brown painted across the snow-white canvas of an Arctic landscape.

In the distance are four Inuvialuit herders on snowmobiles, armed with rifles and keeping watch. They are alert, attuned to the rhythm of hooves falling on frozen earth, and on this crisp morning their job is to escort the reindeer to their calving grounds—but in a grander sense, they are also helping to write a new legacy for this storied herd.

“They’re really smart animals,” said Douglas Esagok, whose seven winters working with the reindeer make him among the most experienced of the Indigenous herders. “I’m always talking to them when I’m moving them. It kind of calms them down, when they recognize my voice or the sound of my snow machine.”

As Canada’s last free-ranging reindeer herd drives forward, just north of the Arctic Circle, the animals carry with them a link to a legendary experiment. It began about a hundred years ago, after the number of local caribou that the Inuvialuit long depended on began to decline and a bold plan was hatched to address food scarcity by importing reindeer. (Caribou and reindeerare the same species, but the latter have been domesticated.) Something similar had been tried at the turn of the century in nearby Alaska, when waves of reindeer boarded boats and trains to make improbable journeys from Siberia and Norway to North America. In late 1929, a chunk of what was then a burgeoning Alaska reindeer population—some 3,500 reindeer—set off for Canada under the care of Sami and Inuit herders. The arduous, zigzagging 1,500-mile journey ended up lasting more than five years, marking a difficult beginning to what came to be known as the Canadian Reindeer Project.

(To save caribou, Indigenous people confront difficult choices.)



Now, decades on, a group of Inuvialuit stakeholders is taking the project further into uncharted territory. The herd, which has been cared for with the help of the Inuvialuit but family owned, was formally purchased in 2021 by the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation. Under the watchful eyes of Esagok and his colleagues, the herd has more than doubled, to nearly 6,000 reindeer, making possible an ambitious plan to build a sustainable path to self-reliance for Inuvialuit people living on their ancestral lands.

“The ultimate goal is to have reindeer abundantly available for Inuvialuit—that’s goal number one,” said Brian Wade, director of the Inuvialuit Community Economic Development Organization. “There’s the food security component to this herd, but there’s also job creation and the economic component to it.”

The reindeer’s transfer to Inuvialuit ownership goes beyond an attempt at establishing stability for the future. It also represents a chance for the Inuvialuit people to take control of a herd imported to their homelands by a colonial government. In the 1930s, when the reindeer came to the Northwest Territories, the role they were meant to play in the lives of Inuvialuit people was mostly to replace their ancestral food-gathering customs. The Canadian government had been establishing administrative stations and allowing the creation of trading outposts throughout the region following its acquisition of the Northwest Territories in the late 1800s. The Indigenous population had for centuries subsisted primarily on hunting and fishing, but with caribou in decline, reindeer were imported to address food shortages. This also changed the relationship the Inuvialuit had with the land, as reindeer could be raised as livestock.

(What color are reindeer eyes? Depends on the season.)

“Reindeer are classified as domesticated animals, the same as a cow or a chicken or a pig,” said Wade. “They’ll graze all day and just keep moving slowly and slowly and slowly finding greener pastures.”

In the years before the IRC took control of the herd, the reindeer were owned by an Inuvialuit family—the Binders—whose associations with the reindeer stretch back to their arrival in the Mackenzie Delta. The Binders had grazed the animals and sold reindeer meat but had increasingly struggled, with too few herders, to stave off predators and keep the herd from splintering. As the number of reindeer dipped, the Inuvialuit leaders at the IRC were in the process of recognizing the powerful role that a bolstered reindeer population could play in the community.

(World’s largest reindeer herd targeted by poachers for antler velvet.)

Plenty of Inuvialuit continue to hunt for their food, but it can be a costly and time-intensive effort, and, as any hunter will attest, some seasons are better than others. Over recent decades, many families have moved away from the traditional subsistence model, depending instead on food markets and grocery stores stocked by southern food supply chains. But in 2020, at the outset of the global pandemic, many of those supply chains broke. The IRC, which began to envision a role for the herd in addressing food shortages, could see clearly that the threat was not hypothetical but immediate.

“We’ve been able to really capitalize on the country food that’s abundant in our region but also tie in the reindeer herd so we could alleviate the pressure on the local caribou herd and have the sustainable protein source,” said Wade. The purchase of the herd, he added, was part of a two-pronged plan toward food sovereignty. The other initiative was the opening of the Country Food Processing Plant in the town of Inuvik, where reindeer, among other food sources, could be prepared and then sent off for distribution to families in need.

(Where are all the caribou?)

Before any reindeer could be harvested, though, the herd needed to be nurtured back to full strength. The IRC brought on Esagok and fellow Inuvialuit herder Steve Cockney, Jr., who then spent months reuniting the dispersed reindeer herd.

“One of the main challenges was rounding up all the stray animals that were spread out over a huge area,” said Esagok. Some groups had strayed as far afield as 80 miles, which meant days of travel for Esagok and his partner. These smaller groups of reindeer were vulnerable to wolves and other predators, and while many animals had been lost and others roamed beyond the two herders’ reach, Esagok said, “we brought all of them together—the ones that we were able to locate, anyway.”

Since then, the IRC has hired four additional herders, with the crew pulling two-week-long shifts of four men on and two men off at any given time. As a result of their efforts, the herd’s numbers have swelled up to 6,000—enough for Country Food Processing to start its work with the reindeer.

(As males evolve to have better weapons, females develop bigger brains.)

Last spring, the plant, now staffed by five full-time employees, led its first official harvest, preparing 176 reindeer from the herd as roasts, ground meat, and ribs, among other items, that were then distributed to Inuvialuit community members. The meals provide a crucial source of country food, grown and sourced in the region, allowing Inuvialuit households that may not be able to hunt for themselves a chance to stay connected to the land and to this chapter in the Inuvialuit story.

For Esagok, the opportunity to play such a critical role in this new form of food stability and cultural revitalization has been a crash course in learning by doing. In just seven years, he, Cockney, and their team became the heirs to an Indigenous tradition imported from the other side of the Arctic, where the Sami had long mastered the practice. His responsibility to pass this knowledge on to younger herders was made less daunting, he said, by the fact that the region’s Indigenous hunters already have most of the skills to do the job, given their familiarity with the landscape. “It’s not that hard of a job if you grow up hunting,” he said. “We try to talk to the younger guys and explain things the best we can, but a lot of it is hands-on. You learn by doing it and by watching and observing the animals.” The reindeer teach them too, he said. Often, it feels as if they are the ones leading the way.

60,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/shimoda-camera-bag-review,"When her beloved—but discontinued—camera bag finally broke, one travel photojournalist went on a deep dive to find the perfect replacement.

For seven years, I relied on my trusty camera bag to accompany me to all the remote places around the world where I reported travel and adventure stories. Last year, it finally broke and I discovered that it had been discontinued. That sent me on an unexpectedly trying mission to find an alternative. There are plenty of camera bags, but as an adventure travel journalist and photographer, I couldn’t get just any bag.

I needed a weather-resistant camera bag that could double as a travel backpack, with room for toiletries, a change of clothes, and my laptop and reporter’s notebooks. It had to be big enough for two cameras, a long lens, and several smaller prime lenses. Yet, it had to be small enough to fit under ever-shrinking airline seats, especially since I travel with just a carry-on and need the overhead space for a duffel or roller bag.

After weeks of research and lots of trial and error, I finally found the perfect adventure camera bag: theShimoda Explore v2 30. I love that this one comes in a women’s edition that conforms to my body. Since I got it in 2024, I’ve taken it to Baja California Sur, Mexico, and the Yukon territory in Canada. It held up well in both extreme conditions, with plenty of room for all my equipment, plus winter essentials for stops in the Yukon’s Whitehorse and Dawson City.

What I like

• Large enough for cameras and travel gear, but small enough to fit under a plane seat

• Shoulder straps and removable waist bands for easily carrying over long distances, especially hikes

• Pockets abound on this pack—great for staying organized and keeping essentials accessible, which is especially important when you’re adventuring

What I don’t like

• Airlines increasingly shrink their under-seat storage, so the pack didn’t fit under every seat (many storage areas can now only fit a small purse)

• My 14-inch MacBook Pro only fits in the laptop compartment without a protective case—fortunately the laptop sleeve is padded

• The pack itself is heavy at five-and-a-half pounds, which can make meeting airline weight limits tricky when you’re already loaded down with cameras and lenses

The bottom line

The Shimoda Explore v2 30 isn’t perfect—no pack is. But it’s the closest I’ve found to fit my needs as an adventure travel photographer. It’s ideal for outdoor-loving photographers who carry one or two cameras and a handful of lenses. Any more than that and you’ll need a larger bag or a camera pack designed solely for photographers. It’s also great for capturing video. The straps have attachments for microphones and there’s a quick-access phone pocket, giving you multiple ways to nail the shot and the audio to accompany it.

Key specifications

•Size: 11.6W x 20.3H x 6.6D inches (exterior dimensions)

•Weight: 5.5 pounds

•Capacity: 30 liters

•Waterproof: Water-resistant with included rain cover

•Laptop sleeve: Room for 16-inch laptops and smaller

•Warranty: Five years

(For amazing travel photos, start with these expert-approved essentials)

Who is the Shimoda Explore v2 30 camera bag best for?

I recommend this bag for adventure travel photographers, writers, and filmmakers because of its durability and design. This bag has shoulder straps and a sturdy waistband to lighten the load on long treks, as well as a small footprint that appeases even hyper-restrictive airlines—an unavoidable aspect of traveling to remote places. The low-key design that looks like any standard backpack makes it ideal for city strolls too. Women photographers who struggle to find a bag that fits their frame may also appreciate this version, which comes in a nice teal.

Shimoda Explore v2 30 camera bag features we love

I’ve found much to love about the Shimoda Explore v2 30, especially for adventure photographers. This includes:

Interior pockets galore

There are more pockets on this backpack than I’ve ever seen on any bag. That forces me to stay organized. I keep like items together—for example, I put my valuables in one compartment, my photography odds-and-ends (lens cleaner, spare batteries) in another. Of course, my camera and lenses secure in the main modular compartment, which is roomy enough for both of my Sony mirrorless cameras, as well as three prime lenses and filters. Unfortunately, my 100-400mm zoom lens is too big for that area, so I pack it in the main top compartment alongside my toiletries.

Smartphone pocket

This is one of my favorite pockets. It’s located on the shoulder strap, which makes it easy to access my hefty iPhone 15 Pro Max for quick photos, videos, and audio recordings.

Compact size

I picked the Shimoda Explore v2 30 because I needed a small, portable bag that would fit under airplane seats. Whether or not it fits depends on the plane, but I’ve only run into issues twice and only because the under-seat space was too small to fit anything but a purse.

The women’s version is sized to my female frame, with multiple adjustment points to ensure the perfect fit—great for long hikes.

A camera andadventure pack

There are many camera backpacks out there, but surprisingly not all are suitable for photography and adventure travel. That’s what drew me to Shimoda. It can support you on many adventures, whether it’s a multiday trek betweensheep farms in Greenlandor a journey to meet some ofPanama’s most remote communities. With shoulder and waist straps, an internal frame for support, a weather-resistant exterior, and a rain cover among its many features, this pack is designed to be just as much a camera bag as it is an adventure bag—and that’s truly hard to find.

Weather resistant

I put this backpack through the wringer on a recent trip to the Yukon, where it spent almost as much time in the snow as it did on my back, while I chased northern lights for six hours. It stayed dry, even after I set it on the snow next to me while I photographed. Of course, the rain cover makes it even more weather-resistant, so it’s good to keep that handy while you’re adventuring too.

Shimoda Explore v2 30 price

The Shimoda Explore v2 30 retails for around $385—pretty similar to other adventure-photography backpacks. That may sound hefty, but I’ve learned you truly get what you pay for. I’m willing to splurge on something I will use on about a dozen or more trips each year. Plus, this bag’s designed to last and comes with a five-year warranty.

How we tested the Shimoda Explore v2 30

I tested the Shimoda Explore v2 30 camera bag on two adventure photography and reporting trips. The first was a five-day trek in the desert and dunes outside Loreto, in Baja California Sur, Mexico, where I photographed the night sky. The second was also a five-day journey in wind and snow in the Yukon, in northern Canada, where I hiked, snowshoed, and chased northern lights. In addition to the elements, I took it on multiple airplanes, so I got to see firsthand how it fit in the overhead bins and beneath the seats.

Final thoughts

When it comes to utility, this Shimoda is like the Swiss Army knife of camera bags. It has pockets for everything you need, plus more you didn’t realize you needed. Numerous clips, hooks, and straps keep gear handy without sacrificing comfort over long distances. However, for all its great features, this pack isn’t for everyone. Travelers who need to carry more than two cameras, or multiple long lenses, will need a larger camera bag. If you have a camera or two, and a handful of small lenses (and even a big one), you’ll be set for your next adventure—rain, shine, or snow.

(The best cameras for travel, tested and reviewed by Nat Geo photo engineers)

No bag is perfect. If the Shimoda Explore v2 30 isn’t for you, I have a few more favorites to consider. I’ve tested a few of these; others are recommended by fellow adventure photographers.

Shimoda Action X40 v2

This was the first Shimoda pack I tried, and it’s a great option for longer treks or the most rugged adventures. With a 40-liter capacity, it’s trickier to fit under the seat of a midsized airplane—something I learned firsthand. Thankfully, however, it fit well into the overhead bins. This pack is especially versatile, with a roll-top upper pocket that expands or compresses based on how much gear you need. I use this one on trips that require more camera gear and equipment than usual, such as long-distance or overnight hikes.

Lowepro Pro Trekker BP 450 AWII

Chilean photographerMiguel Angel Fuentealbaspends his days in the field tracking and photographing pumas, while capturing the beauty of Patagonia. He knows a thing or two about adventure backpacks. He recommends the LowePro Trekker BP 450 AWII because of its compact size and usefulness.

“It’s perfect for traveling,” he told me, noting the important perk for travelers: it fits airline carry-on requirements. The pack is designed to fit two pro mirrorless or DSLR cameras, as well as up to six lenses (depending on size). It has space for a laptop up to 15 inches. Like the Shimoda packs, this one has a removable waist belt that makes it ideal for hiking for the shot.

AtlasPacks Athlete Camera Backpack

Adventure photographerJay Clue, who travels North America by van to capture the continent’s most eye-popping landscapes, swears by the AtlasPacks Athlete Camera Backpack. “It’s honestly the best camera bag for travel and hiking,” he told me. “I never leave home without it.”

Clue goes deep into deserts, forests, and mountains for his photography, and the Atlas pack can keep up. It comes in 20 liters and 40 liters, with a slim profile that fits under airplane seats. The ergonomic shoulder straps and hip belt reduce the stress of carrying gear long distances, while a weather-resistant build keeps gear safe in all sorts of outdoor activities.

Peak Design Outdoor Backpack

Peak Design has made a major name for itself in the world of travel photography—particularly with its ultra-light travel tripod, which I love for astrophotography. The Peak Design Outdoor Backpack works seamlessly with accessories like the Peak Design Capture Camera Clip, which attaches cameras to the shoulder strap or waist belt for quick access.

These packs fit a mix of photography gear, toiletries, and clothing—something adventure photographers, like me, crave in a bag. A weatherproof Terra Shell keeps gear safe in the field. Perhaps the best feature? The large camera cube. It’s sold separately, but I love that you can carry it around on short city walks and then pack it when you’re ready to go.

As the Islamic holy month ofRamadancomes to a close, Muslims around the world are preparing for a celebration filled with prayer, feasts, and community. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and is expected to be observed on March 30 or March 31 this year, depending on the sighting of the moon.

Beginning and ending with the new moon, Ramadan falls on the ninth month of the Arabic lunar calendar. It is believed by Muslims to be when the first verses of the Koran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad more than a millennium ago. From sunrise to sunset, Muslims abstain from food, drink, and vices like gossip and lying. Not only is it meant to be a period of self-reflection, but to serve as a reminder to be charitable to the less fortunate.

62,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-camera-bag-for-travel,"From backpacks to crossbodies—these expert-approved bags offer plenty of protection for the way you travel.

As a photographer and travel journalist, I’m always looking for ways to optimize my gear, and camera bags are essential. For me, the best travel camera bag must be compact enough to avoid the gate-check, durable enough to withstand bumpy safari vehicles and hiking excursions, and it needs to hold up—comfortably—under the weight of a long lens, laptop, and two camera bodies.

Competition is stiff, but it’s tough to beat the 26LThink Tank MindShift BackLightas an all-rounder camera bag for travel. With its customizable interior and separate pockets for personal essentials—including a 16-inch laptop—the BackLight transitions easily between backcountry and overhead compartment. But we have a few more favorite bags to share.

A great camera bag should keep your gear protected and in place—ideally with adjustable internal dividers to customize your layout. Extra space for accessories, snacks, or a jacket is a plus. Water-resistant material (or an included rain cover), comfortable straps, and airline-friendly sizing are further essentials.

Why we like it:Think Tank was founded 20 years ago by photographers, for photographers. The MindShift BackLight is a terrific example of the brand’s design prowess.

The 26L features rear-panel access, which is ideal for swapping gear without getting the back of the bag or the straps dirty. It also provides peace of mind when you’re moving through crowded spaces.

The BackLight has nine liters of capacity, compartments for a 16-inch laptop and tablet, a water bottle pocket and tripod-toting attachment, plus an ultra-supportive harness system.

The 26L size allows you to breeze through boarding and keep you nimble on the trails. Outdoor enthusiasts will further appreciate the daisy chain, lash points, and loops for an ice axe or trekking poles.

Keep in mind:The outdoorsy design of the BackLight may not be to everyone’s taste. Depending on your setup, this bag may be too small for the number (and size) of lenses you can carry.

Product details: Exterior dimensions:11.4 x 20.3 x 7.9 in. |Interior capacity:10.2 x 19.3 x 5.9 in. |Weight:3.9 lbs. |Warranty:Limited lifetime

Why we like it:Bellroy products shine for their attention to detail. This sling has self-compressing gussets to adapt to your loadout, adjustable padded dividers, and a main compartment with a double-ended zipper that opens so you can rummage around. There’s also a key clip, lens cap storage, stretchy slip pockets for things like filters and SD cards, and detachable tripod carry straps.

The Venture camera sling is perfect for a compact camera and everyday essentials for walking around town. You’ll keep a nice low profile with the modest 10L size and stay comfortable, thanks to the lightly padded shoulder strap. The sling isn’t waterproof, but it’s made with water-resistant ripstop material and water-resistant zippers. You’ll be fine if you’re caught in a surprise afternoon shower.

Keep in mind:This is a pricey little bag. It’s best for someone with a small camera who is comfortable carrying a sling.

This travel camera bag is a great option for packing your camera into a larger bag or suitcase for transit. At your destination, you can clip on the strap and hit the town with whatever you’ll need for the day.

We appreciate that it comes in four sizes, making the BYOB a good choice for a variety of camera kits. The 9 fits a camera body and two or three lenses, plus small accessories.

Keep in mind:With its boxy design, the Tenba BYOB isn’t the most stylish option on the market. But for us, practicality trumps sartorial appeal.

Why we like it:Shimoda bags are built for comfort and protection in the field—it’s no wonder the pros love it. London-based travel photographer and writer Bella Falk ofPassport&Pixelscarries an Action X40 from Shimoda’swomen’s fitline, praising its “extra space for things like clothing and food if I need to be out all day in cold weather, and a removable core so I can leave the gear behind and use it as a regular backpack,” she says.

This bag is ideal for outdoor work—you can attach skis and a helmet, let alone a tripod and water bottle. Leo Plunkett, a Bristol, England-baseddocumentary filmmaker, uses the slightly larger Action X70 and says it’s “perfect for shoots where you’re constantly on the move—running through jungles or jumping in and out of a car,” he says. “The thing I love most is when I get back from a shoot, I can transfer out the core unit. It really is a bag for every occasion.”

The Action X40 allows you to customize your carry experience with different core inserts, an expandable rolltop, laptop sleeves in both the front and rear of the bag, and torso height to ensure a perfect fit.

Keep in mind:The Action X40 is not a lightweight bag. It’ll do fine as a carry-on, but weighing in at six pounds before you’ve loaded anything into it means you may need to double-check airline weight restrictions—or pay up for a more forgiving seating class.

Product details: Exterior dimensions:11.8 x 20.9 x 7.9 in. |Interior capacity:11.6 x 20.7 x 7.5 in. |Weight:6 lbs. |Warranty:5 years

(These point-and-shoot cameras make snapping vacation pics a cinch)

Why we like it:The Everyday Tote doesn’t receive nearly as much attention as Peak Design’s popularEveryday Backpack, but it should. This bag looks more like a nicely structured tote than a camera bag, which is great for discretion in busy cities and adds to the Everyday Tote’s versatility.

Close the top access with a zip or the magnetic clasp and modify the interior to fit your camera kit with Peak Design’s FlexFold dividers. Slide in a 13-inch laptop and a few personal accessories too. You can carry it all with confidence thanks to the bag’s water-resistant material and waterproof bottom liner.

Because shoulder bags can weigh you down, we like that you can carry the Everyday Tote either by the handles or the included padded shoulder strap. It also has a luggage pass-through strap and comes with a key tether, plus two external carry straps—perfect for bringing a jacket when you don’t want to sacrifice internal space.

Keep in mind:When loaded, this tote can be tedious to navigate since you’re limited to access only from the top.

Product details: Exterior dimensions:17.3 x 14.8 x 6.7 in. |Interior capacity:15L, 20L with the top unfolded |Weight:2.2 lbs. |Warranty:Lifetime

Why we like it:Camera bags often look like camera bags despite a designer’s best intentions—not so with the Claremont. This elegant handbag is designed as a leather crossbody with a quilted, padded interior to protect your camera and an extra lens.

You’ll find small slip pockets for keeping SD cards secure, a zippered rear pocket that’s great for a passport, and a turn-lock closure for the main compartment. It comes in four colors in full-grain leather, with removable internal dividers so you can use the bag as a regular purse.

Keep in mind:The leather strap is adjustable but fairly thin. Under the weight of camera gear, it may not be comfortable for carrying all day.

Product details: Exterior dimensions:10.5 x 5.5 x 8.5 in. |Interior capacity:9.5 x 7 x 4.5 in. |Weight:1.5 lbs. |Warranty:1 year

(Our favorite travel backpacks have tons of pockets, anti-theft zippers, and more)

Why we like it:“Waterproof” is often inaccurately used interchangeably with “water-resistant.” But this camera bag can back its waterproof claim. It’s made of PVC tarpaulin with fully welded seams made to keep out dust, sand, and water. The brand claims that this bag will protect your gear if it’s briefly submerged in water (it floats!), making it ideal for water activities.

The OverBoard waterproof camera bag has internal accessory pockets and a padded base. It also comes with two removable straps allowing you to wear it as a backpack or shoulder bag.

Keep in mind:This is essentially a luxury drybag, so there are no internal dividers or organization to keep camera bodies and lenses separate.

Product details: Exterior dimensions:15 x 9.8 x 5.9 x 7.9 in. |Interior capacity:15L |Weight:0.9 lbs.|Warranty:5 years

Why we like it:The VEO Select 45M is my current go-to for photographic travel. Despite its compact size (capacity is 14 liters), I can fit a 14-inch laptop, two camera bodies, four lenses (including a 150-600mm), and accessories like battery chargers and a blower. Even loaded out, I can still fit this bag under the seat in front of me on an airplane. I also love that there are three access points: From the rear panel, the top, and the side.

By removing the divider that separates personal items, I reconfigured the interior to accommodate my long lens with an attached camera, which I can now grab quickly, whether the bag is lying on the seat next to me or standing upright. That kind of versatility comes in handy on safari.

The VEO Select easily accommodates a water bottle or tripod. It has a hidden rear pocket and a luggage pass-through. Extras include a rain cover and a shoulder strap, for a different carry option.

Keep in mind:The slim design means there’s no wiggle room for stuffing the external pockets—what you see is what you get.

Product details: Exterior dimensions:18.25 x 12.62 x 7.5 in. |Interior capacity:17.7 x 10.8 x 4.3 in. (14L) |Weight:3.3 lbs. |Warranty:Limited lifetime

(Fanny packs—the retro fashion accessory that’s perfect for travelers)

A sturdy, durable, and organized camera bag is an essential piece of travel luggage. You want to ensure that your gear is as protected and as comfortable to carry as possible—ideally within the constraints of air travel regulations. In compiling this list of best camera bags for travel, I leaned on my background as a professional photographer and interviewed other expert photographers. These are the factors I considered:

•Size:Camera bag size is critical, not just for portability, but also to ensure you won’t have to check your gear due to baggage restrictions.

•Features:There’s no such thing as a perfect bag for every photographer, but most photographers need a versatile interior configuration, pockets for accessories and personal items, and comfortable carrying options.

•Material:Protecting camera equipment from rain, dust, sand, and the occasional bump or drop is a big part of why we elect to buy specially designed camera bags in the first place. I chose bags that are constructed with high-quality materials and secure closures.

•Warranty:Good bags usually don’t come cheap, so it’s reassuring to know a brand has your back in case something isn’t a hundred percent.

In her quest for finding the perfect travel camera bag, London-based travel photographer and writer Bella Falk ofPassport&Pixelssays that size is critical. “A travel camera bag has to be big and padded enough to contain and protect all my gear, while at the same time being small enough to meet airline hand luggage rules.”

Here are more things to look for when shopping for a camera bag.

Don’t ignore bag weight

Even the most lightweight camera bodies and lenses will feel heavy if you carry them around for hours. While a good camera bag for travel should be sturdy enough to protect its contents, remember that the weight of the bag itself contributes to the overall burden. If you choose a weighty bag—like theShimoda Designs Action X40—make sure it’s equipped with a comfortable, supportive harness. Well-padded straps and a wide, load-distributed waist belt will go a long way toward reducing discomfort on the road.

Think features, not flash

Sure, it’s great if a camera bag looks nice, but toting expensive equipment should mean prioritizing practicality. Consider which features are likely to matter most to you and shop accordingly. Are you planning to carry multiple lenses? A laptop? A tripod? Do you want the option to use your camera bag as a regular backpack or sling? Do you need a dedicated pocket to accommodate the 10 protein bars you refuse to travel without? Understand how you like to travel with your camera and then look for a bag that will give you the support you need so you can enjoy your trip.

Try before you buy, if possible

Camera bags are similar to shoes—you don’t know if they’re going to work for you unless you try them on. If you’re able, take time to stop by a camera or electronics shop in person and try out different bags to get a feel for comfort and capacity.

Can you bring a camera on a plane?

Generally, yes, you can bring a camera on a plane. It’s best to keep your camera and lenses with you on an airplane, so check your carrier for their carry-on size rules. All the travel camera bags on our list are carry-on appropriate in most situations.

How do I pack my camera for travel?

Using a proper camera bag will go a long way toward keeping your camera safe during transit. Padded dividers keep everything in place and protect your gear from scratches or impact damage. Make sure lens caps are on, cameras are switched off, and don’t forget spare batteries, memory cards, and essential cables.

What is the best material for a camera bag?

Camera bag materials can vary widely, from leather to nylon, polyester, canvas, and beyond. Be aware of the difference between truly waterproof material, like the PVC tarpaulin used on theOverBoard waterproof camera bag, versus DWR (durable water repellency) coated or impregnated materials. Water resistance is terrific and more than sufficient for most camera bags, but you won’t be able to take yourEveryday Totepaddleboarding.

Does a camera bag count as luggage?

Yes, a camera bag counts as luggage. Depending on the size of your camera bag, it may qualify as a personal item if it can fit underneath the seat in front of you on an airplane. Otherwise, it’s best to ensure the bag fits standard carry-on size requirements to fit into the overhead bin. Always check your airline’s requirements, as every carrier has different rules.

63,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/worlds-first-supercomputers-photos,"Enormous dimensions, complicated military calculations, and thousands of vacuum tubes—this was the early supercomputer.

In the 1940s and ‘50s, programmable machines capable of performing calculations and operations on a scale never seen before were developed, mainly in the United States. Although of enormous dimensions, they were the prototypes for the personal computer.

(See how new technology transformed the American workforce.)

In 1936 Howard Aiken, a graduate student at Harvard University, decided to create a programmable computer inspired by the 19th-century work of English mathematician Charles Babbage. In 1939 Aiken secured funding from IBM. Two years later the United States Navy joined the initiative, with the aim of using the machine to determine the trajectory of long-distance projectiles, a calculation of high complexity. The Mark I was completed by a team of men and women in 1944 and was used, among other things, to calculate the range of the atomic bomb’s implosion. The Mark I was of imposing dimensions: The device was nearly 50 feet long, weighed five tons, and had 750,000 components. The three punched tape readers at the back of the room were used for the introduction and collection of data, among other elements. Aiken, in his Navy uniform, examines one of the tapes.

In 1943 the United States Army funded a computer project led by two University of Pennsylvania engineers, John Mauchly and John Presper Eckert, Jr. The goal was to create an electronic machine that would be faster and more reliable than the mechanically based Mark I. The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) occupied an entire room measuring 50 by 30 feet, with 40 panels more than six feet high. The ENIAC contained over 17,000 vacuum tubes, which regulated the electrical circuit much more quickly and efficiently than the Mark I’s mechanical switches. The computer was programmed using three function boards. It could make 5,000 additions per second, while the Mark I could make fewer than four. Introduced to the public in February 1946 as “the world’s first electronic computer,” the ENIAC was used by the military to calculate the feasibility of a proposed design for a hydrogen bomb.

At the end ofWorld War II, there was widespread interest in creating the “universal computer” envisioned by the British scientist Alan Turing. American theorist John von Neumann published a pioneering article in 1946. In it he pointed out that the computer of the future would work with programs stored in the same memory as the data, instead of using an external electronic board for this function.

(Oppenheimer: The secrets he protected and the suspicions that followed him.)

That same year, the inventors of the ENIAC, Mauchly and Eckert, began the construction of the EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer). Presented in 1949, it was the second computer of the von Neumann type with memory holding both data and instruction, after the EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator) was built at the University of Cambridge three months earlier. The EDVAC introduced a new information-storage system: the mercury delay line, a predecessor of the transistor. This made it possible to reduce the use of vacuum tubes, which frequently melted. The EDVAC occupied 490 square feet of surface area.

The EDVAC was used to calculate ballistic trajectories for the military, but its designers were also interested in creating computers for civilian use. In 1946 Eckert and Mauchly won a contract to build a computer for the U.S. Census Bureau, which would replace the tabulating machines used since the late 19th century to summarize information stored on punch cards. Although the duo ran into financial difficulties and their company was acquired by the typewriter manufacturer Remington, in 1951 they introduced the UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer). In its electronic circuits, the UNIVAC also used mercury delay lines for memory, which allowed the number of vacuum tubes to be reduced to 5,000.

As a result of their reduction, the computer was smaller, but no less powerful. It could read 7,200 decimal digits per second. The photo below shows how the information was entered using a keyboard and a console. The results were recorded on magnetic tape, rather than punch cards, an innovation that census officials took time to get used to. The information on the magnetic tape was then printed out onto a continuous ream of computer paper.

The development of computers directly threatened the business of IBM, a company that had prospered since the early 20th century by manufacturing punch card machines. IBM’s response was to develop its own computer. In 1954 IBM engineers presented what would be the first successful commercial computer. The IBM 650 cost $500,000, compared to a million dollars for the UNIVAC. In eight years, 1,800 units were sold. However, the IBM 650 was a far cry from modern computers: It worked with a magnetic drum memory instead of a hard disk (which IBM introduced in 1956); it used vacuum tubes instead of transistors (IBM’s competitor Bell Labs fully transistorized a computer in 1954, and IBM followed in 1959); and the programs were recorded on punch cards inserted by means of classic tabulating machines.

Computer scientist Donald Knuth credits IBM for developing university computing classes: “IBM donated about 100 ‘free’ computers during the 1950s, with the stipulation that programming courses must be taught.”

64,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-portable-photo-printer,"Even if you’re not scrapbooking, these powerful compact printers make it easy and fun to remember favorite travel moments.

Digital photos may be convenient for travel, but there’s something special about holding a printed picture. Portable photo printers let you turn your favorite snapshots into instant keepsakes, no matter where you are.

“I’ve been journaling my whole life but started taking it more seriously in 2020 as a way to relive my adventures, and since then, I incorporate different creative elements into my journaling, including photography,” says Ayusha Ayalur, a product manager from New York City. “Having a portable photo printer allows me to capture moments instantly and document them right away, making my journaling feel more immersive and personal.”

When shopping for a portable photo printer, Ayalur suggests one that’s lightweight and compact. “[That] can make a huge difference in how often you print, and hence, justify the cost,” he says.

Lisa VanderVeen,a travel writer from New Jersey, says she’s been keeping a journal since she was a student. Now, after visiting nearly 50 countries, she says she’s used bullet journals, longform notebooks, and typed entries to memorialize her trips.

“These journals/albums are my favorite travel souvenirs, as I can pull them out years after a trip and remember sensory details,” she says. “For example, I adhered a business card from a restaurant in my Greece journal, beside a photo of the delicious octopus I ate there.”

VanderVeen recommends a printer with photo paper that’s easy to find while traveling, so you’re not restricted to what you bring with you.

I’ve used theFujifilm Instax Mini Link 2 Smartphone Printeron many of my trips as a travel journalist. I love how simple it is to use and the 15-second printing time. It’s easily my overall top pick, but I’ve found other portable photo printers that excel at other features too. Scroll on for my full review.

When choosing the best portable photo printer, look for high print quality. Pay attention to the type of connectivity (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi), as that can impact portability. Of course, it should be compatible with your primary photo device. Additional factors, including print size, battery life, and ongoing costs, such as ink or thermal paper, can also be important.

Why we like it:As a travel photographer and journalist, I’ve used the Fujifilm Instax on trips for years. It’s lightweight and develops images in under two minutes, then prints two-by-three-inch photos in just under 15 seconds. I love the fun creative features, which let you add extras like doodles, filters, and photo effects before printing. It has a seamless Bluetooth connection and charges via USB-C, making it compatible with most smartphones and tablets.

Keep in mind:It’s easy to burn through the print packs, especially in the beginning as you figure out lighting and camera controls. You can only edit photos through the app.

Product details:Ink color:Color |Output size:2 x 3 in. |Weight:11.2 oz. |Printing tech:Thermal |Connectivity:Bluetooth, USB

Why we like it:This wireless portable photo printer is a great choice for frequent travelers. The Bluetooth connects to a variety of iOS and Android devices and prints on thermal, so you don’t have to worry about running out of ink while you’re on the go. We like that it’s packable—at about two pounds, it easily fits into a backpack, yet itsupports U.S. letter, legal, A4, and A5 paper.

Keep in mind:The print quality is great for documents and graphics, but it may not be ideal for high-quality images. The printer also relies on thermal paper, which can be difficult to find and expensive. Customers also point out that the paper rolls print on one continuous page. However, you can print one page at a time. It only prints in black and white.

Product details:Ink color:Black |Output size:Variety |Weight:2 lbs.|Printing tech:Thermal |Connectivity:Bluetooth, USB

(How to turn your cellphone into a powerful travel tool)

Why we like it:This portable photo printer produces high-quality, non-pixelated, vibrant prints. It’s easy to set up and weighs under two pounds. The printer supports both wireless and USB connections, enabling you to print directly from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. It features a built-in three-and-a-half-inch display for viewing, editing, and adding filter effects to photos, which print in a four-by-six-inch size.

Keep in mind:This printer can be a good choice for casual photographers or anyone who enjoys printing personal photos on the go, but it’s not the best for producing large prints. The paper and ink packs can get a bit pricey, especially if you print frequently. While it’s not too heavy, it’s a bulky box that would fit better in a carry-on than a backpack.

Product details:Color:Black |Output size:4 x 6 in. |Weight:1.9 lbs.|Printing tech:Dye-sublimation |Connectivity:Wi-Fi

Why we like it:The HP OfficeJet 250 All-in-One Portable Printer is a versatile option for printing and scanning on the go. It connects wirelessly or with USB connectivity, so you can print, scan, and copy anywhere. It produces both black-and-white and color documents up to 8.5 x 11 inches and has an intuitive control panel for easy operation. We also like the long-lasting battery—up to 225 pages per charge, according to the brand.

Keep in mind:At 6.5 pounds this is not a lightweight printer and may not be ideal for trips where you’re constantly on the go. The paper tray holds just 10 sheets, which can be an inconvenience. Additionally, because this is a printer and scanner, it’s expensive and may be best suited to business travelers.

Product details:Ink color:Black and color |Output size:Variety, including envelope and photo (4 x 6 in.) |Weight:6.5 lbs.|Printing tech:Inkjet |Connectivity:Wired and wireless

(For amazing travel photos, start with these essentials)

Why we like it:This printer produces wide-format prints (3.4 x 4.3 inches), offering more space than Instax Mini prints. Compact and lightweight, it connects via Bluetooth to both iOS and Android devices through a dedicated app. The app gives you creative control with features like filters, text, and QR codes. The print quality has a nostalgic instant film feel, and the images develop in about 90 seconds, which is great for scrapbooking, travel journaling, and casual photography during downtimes.

Keep in mind:The cost of the wide-format Instax film is more expensive than the standard Mini film, especially if you print often. The printer doesn’t offer the same high-resolution quality as a digital photo printer, so while the prints are great for casual use, they may not be crisp enough for framing.

Product details:Ink color:Color|Output size:3.4 x 4.3 in. |Weight:12 oz.|Printing tech:Photographic print |Connectivity:Bluetooth

Why we like it:This compact portable photo printer lets you print two-by-three-inch photos directly from your phone. It uses Zink (zero-ink) technology, which means you don’t need ink cartridges, and the peel-and-stick paper makes it easy to adhere photos to your travel journal or anywhere. It connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth and works with both iOS and Android devices.

Keep in mind:While it’s easy to use, the print resolution can be a bit lacking, especially compared to more expensive or larger photo printers. The printer can also be a little slow, taking about a minute per print.

Product details:Ink color:Color |Output size:2 x 3 in. |Weight:8.8 oz.|Printing tech:Zink Technology |Connectivity:Bluetooth

(6 of the easiest cameras to use for travel)

Why we like it:This compact and portable photo printer produces photos, notes, and custom stickers. It uses inkless thermal printing technology and connects via Bluetooth to both iOS and Android devices. It works on both sticky and non-stick paper to print two-by-three-inch photos, plus the app offers a host of features, including AI and the ability to turn photos into line art.

Keep in mind:The print quality lacks sharpness and vibrancy, making it less suitable for detailed images. It’s slower than some mini printers and limited to small-format prints.

Product details:Ink color:Monochrome |Output size:2 x 3 in. |Weight:15 oz.|Printing tech:Thermal |Connectivity:Bluetooth

(Browse easily on your next trip with one of these top portable routers)

In examining portable photo printers for this list, I prioritized portability and ease of use. Compatibility, quality of prints, and connectivity were also key attributes.

I also relied on real-world testing from people who are avid scrapbookers, journal regularly, and real customer reviews, including expert interviews. I also drew from my own personal experience as a travel photographer. Here’s what I weighed:

•Third-party reviews:These are important because they offer unbiased, real-world insight that reflect how the printer performed in the field.

•Connectivity:Printers that work across devices, including phones, tablets, and laptops, are especially important, whether you’re travel for work or leisure.

•Practicality:The overall weight and print quality help travelers find the best value for their needs.

There are lots of factors to consider when shopping for a portable photo printer. Besides quality and portability, it’s important to make sure the printer works with the devices you plan to use while traveling.

Not all printers produce the same print size—some print only two-by-three-inch photos, while others print on a variety of sizes, including envelopes and even legal size paper.

For travelers, battery life and overall costs are very important. VanderVeen suggests trying out a few in advance, if possible, especially if image quality is important or if you have an extended holiday planned where switching printers isn’t an option.

Here are more tips to keep in mind.

Compatibility

Ayalur recalls one instance where unreliable app connection caused her to miss some key moments of journaling on the go. “Before you buy a portable photo printer, make sure it works with your device, whether it’s an iPhone, iPad, or Android phone or tablet,” she says. “Most printers connect via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and need a supporting app from the App Store or Google Play. Also, check reviews of the app as they usually are good indicators of reliability.”

Quality

Print resolution and color accuracy can make a big difference in the sharpness and vibrancy of your photos. Ink-based printers deliver more detailed images by layering ink for better depth and color accuracy. Inkless options, such as thermal printers, are budget-friendly and portable but don’t always match the same level of detail.

If print quality is a priority, then consider an ink-based printer, knowing that ink will be an added cost over time. Customers were particularly impressed with the quality of our top pick, theCanon Selphy CP1500 Compact Photo Printer.

Print size

Portable printers tend to produce smaller prints, typically 2 x 3 inches, which works best for scrapbooking, travel journaling, or making instant stickers. While smaller prints are more travel-friendly, they may not capture as much detail as larger ones (4 x 6 inches or 8.5 x 11 inches).

Battery life

Think about battery life when choosing a portable printer, especially if you’ll be using it on the go without easy access to a power outlet. Some models can print 20-50 photos per charge, while others may need more frequent recharging. Our pick, theHP OfficeJet 250 All-in-One Portable Printer, prints 225 pages before recharging, according to the brand, which makes it a good choice for business travelers or anyone needing to print lots of four-by-six-inch photos for an event.

Cost

Inkless printers, like those using Zink or thermal technology, don’t need ink, which can save you money over time. Instead, they use special heat-sensitive paper to create images. However, the cost of the paper (like Zink paper) can add up if you’re constantly printing. On the other hand, ink-based printers require ink cartridges or ribbons, which can drive up ongoing costs.

Speed

If you need to print multiple photos quickly, especially for events or gatherings, printing speed is important. Some portable printers take between 30 seconds to a minute per print, while others may be slower.

If you’re planning to print many photos at once, be sure to check the print time per photo or pages per minute (ppm) to make sure the printer suits your needs. Our top pick, theFujifilm Instax Mini Link 2 Smartphone Printer, prints photos in under 15 seconds.

Portability

The biggest benefit of a portable printer is the size. Choose a lightweight model that easily fits into your bag or backpack. While some are small enough to fit in a pocket, larger printers can be a hassle, especially if they’re bulky. Think about how much space the printer takes up and how often you’ll need to carry it.

Features and ease of usage

Some portable printers offer advanced features like adding text, filters, frames, or QR codes to your photos before printing. These tools are ideal for scrapbooking, creating personalized gifts, or adding a creative touch to your prints. Read through the app capabilities to see if the portable photo printer is right for you.

Price

Portable photo printers come in a wide price range, from budget-friendly options under $50 to pricier models over $100. Inkless printers are usually more affordable, while dye-sublimation and photo printers tend to cost more. In addition to the printer’s price, the cost of paper and ink or thermal cartridges also add up. Consider how frequently you’ll use the printer and whether the features justify the cost.

Reviews

Before making a purchase, it’s a good idea to check user reviews and expert opinions, not just for the printer but also for the app (if applicable). Look for comments on reliability, ease of use, and print quality.

Do portable photo printers need ink?

Portable printers come in both ink-based and inkless varieties. Ink-based models, such as inkjets, rely on cartridges or toner to produce prints with rich detail and color accuracy. In contrast, inkless printers, like those using Zink (Zero Ink) or thermal technology, create images by applying heat to specialized paper, eliminating the need for ink.

Inkless options offer a more convenient and cost-effective solution over time since they don’t require ink replacements. However, they may compromise  color accuracy and print longevity, compared to ink-based alternatives.

How does a portable photo printer work?

A portable photo printer connects to your device via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or USB and uses either ink-based or inkless technology to print images or documents. Ink-based models, such as inkjet or dye-sublimation printers, produce high-quality, vibrant prints by layering ink on paper. Inkless options, like Zink or thermal printers, use heat-sensitive paper to create images without the need for ink, making them more compact and efficient.

Which phones are compatible with portable photo printers?

Most portable photo printers are compatible with iPhones (iPhone 5 and newer), iPads, and Android devices (Android 4.0 or later). They connect via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and often include associated apps on the App Store and Google Play, making printing and customization quick and convenient.

65,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-rest-and-restore-in-western-nevadas-great-outdoors,"Follow National Geographic photographer Tara Kerzhner to the Silver State, where natural beauty, outdoor adventure, and tranquility combine to create the ideal escape.

Nevadahas long been synonymous withthrilling escapades, but for travelers seeking a more peaceful, restorative respite, the western side of the state offers the perfect retreat.

Within about an hour’s drive ofReno-Tahoe International Airport, there are mountains to explore, lakes to paddle, and trails that speak to the soul. Here, landscapes tempt you to try something new or practice something familiar, and locals are happy to point you to a quiet spot all your own. A trip to western Nevada means never having to choose between relaxation, recovery, or renewal.

This fall, National Geographic photographerTara Kerzhnerreturned to Nevada to capture the natural beauty and restorative power of the state’s western landscapes, discovering both—and more—in the communities of Genoa, Lake Tahoe, and Reno.

Genoa(pronounced ""Juh-NO-ah"") is a historic destination that calls to those in search of authentic charm. The tiny town with a population of roughly 1,300 sits 42 miles south of Reno. You could easily drive past it, lost in the rolling pastures and ranches along the way, but Kerzhner believes this charming little town in the foothills of Carson Valley is well worth your time.

Nevada’s oldest settlement started as a trading post in 1851. Today, it remains a cluster of historic buildings and community gathering spots that offer visitors a picture-perfect experience at the edge of the Sierra Nevada range.

Kerzhner recommends starting, as she did, in one of the many mineral pools and hot springs that make up the area. (Nevada is actually home to more than 300 hot springs—more than any other state in the nation.) AtDavid Walley’s Resort, condo-style accommodations are complemented by natural pools, soothing hot springs, and breathtaking views of the surrounding peaks—making any time of day ideal for a dip.

After you’ve soaked your stress away, dry off and head to the town’s downtown district where, along with Genoa Antiques and Genoa Trading Company, you’ll find the famedGenoa Bar and Saloon. Nevada’s oldest ""thirst parlor"" (built in 1853) is as authentic as they come. The saloon boasts a rich history, and has welcomed a slew of famous visitors over the years, from Mark Twain to Clark Gable to Raquel Welch. Here you can sip on a saloon-famous Bloody Mary or join in on a friendly game of billiards. Before you leave, be sure to check out the original diamond-dust mirror found behind the bar. It was shipped from Scotland to San Francisco before traveling by covered wagon across the mountains. Fun fact: If you shine a flashlight on the mirror, the diamond dust encased within will sparkle right before your eyes.

“It’s a really cool local vibe,” says Kerzhner. “Here [in Genoa], you don’t really feel like you’re a tourist at all.”

Nearby, the quaintMormon Station State Historic Parkoffers a broader historical perspective. The replica 1851 fort includes a trading post, blacksmith shop, and antique wagons to explore.A bit farther down the road, you’ll findThe Nature Conservancy’sRiver Fork Ranch Preserve, a serene stretch of trails through 800 acres of golden grass wetlands that rise up to meet blue-tinged mountains. Popular with hikers, bikers, and runners, it’s also the place to spot western pond turtles, leopard frogs, and bald eagles in their natural habitats.

“It’s about five minutes from downtown Genoa, but it feels like you’re in a totally different place,” says Kerzhner of her dusk visit. “It was really quite striking, especially just how peaceful it was.”

That sense of calm stays with you even as you head out of town. Before you go, be sure to take note of the big red barn on historicVan Sickle Station Ranch. It’s been here since 1855. Owner Ginger Teig helms the 600-acre property along with her mother, Gail Teig—a family committed to protecting the town’s historical past.

Any day inLake Tahoe,where clear, blue water peeks out between towering pines, is a good day. Fortunately, that’s pretty much every day here.

“Being on the lake is very serene,” says Kerzhner, who chose a clear kayak tour withClearly Tahoeas her introduction to the area. “The water is super clear. You can see all the rocks on the bottom:I felt like I was inside a fish tank!”

While the lake is perfect in the summer, it’s also very popular—which means you’ll have to wake up early to find a beach site or parking spot. Visit in the fall for easy access to the lake and experiences that are both calming and awe-inspiring.

The tour began atSand Harbor State Park, where Kerzhner took in views of the lake’s scenic shoreline, along with notable places like Bonsai Rock,Thunderbird Lodge, and Chimney Beach. And when the temptation proved too much, paddlers beached their kayaks for a cool, refreshing dip.

Fresh and energized, Kerzhner headed for the mountains that surround Lake Tahoe. In the summer of 1983, renowned mountain biker and adventurer Max Jones forged a trail that’s arguably one of the most scenic in the world: theFlume Trail. Set 1,500 feet above Lake Tahoe, this 4.5-mile path is primarily used by mountain bikers who appreciate its winding routes, steep drops, and diverse terrain. Jones also startedFlume Trail Tahoe, which offers bike and e-bike rentals, shuttle service, and expert advice to help more visitors experience the trail’s stunning views and challenging routes.

Wellness options abound in Lake Tahoe.Yogis and meditators will find Zen-worthy perches among the giant sun-drenched boulders atHidden Beach. Those seeking a bit more adrenaline can hop on horseback with a guided tour fromZephyr Cove Stables.And if you’d rather move at the pace of your own two feet, the famedMonkey Rock Trailheadoffers a great workout with calmingviews of shimmering waters and pine-covered peaks.

At the end of the day, pampering comes easy in one of the spacious rooms, upscale suites, or private waterfront cottages at theHyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resortin North Tahoe. TheNorth Tahoelocation is a paradise for adventurers who want to mix respite with renewal. At the resort’s 500-foot private beach, you can wrap up a day of adventure sitting by a fire pit, s’mores or, hot toddy in hand, watching the sun set.

“The Biggest Little City in the World”is small enough to offer a sense of calm, yet buzzy enough to serve up the comforts of a major metropolitan area. Start your day with a stop atPerenn Bakery, a local favorite, where you can enjoy an organic, locally roasted coffee paired with a freshly baked pastry. Popular choices include the almond croissant, cinnamon roll, or an Earl Grey cookie.

The artistry in the pastries is just the start.Reno’s art sceneis renowned: You’ll find more than 185 murals, sculptures, and other works of art, with new pieces popping up literally overnight at times. Kerzhner says the best way to see it all is with the crew atPineapple Pedicab Tours. Friendly and knowledgeable, their guides also double as city ambassadors, happily sharing insights and tips about the place they love.

When it’s time to turn in, check intoBest Bet Motor Lodge. “This place is really special,” says Kerzhner, of the new boutique midtown hotel. “You’re in the city there, but once you go into your room, it’s very quiet. Every little detail of that lodge was very well thought out, from the beds (super comfortable) to the coffee (gooseneck pour-over). It was perfect.”

The star amenity here:Reno Sauna Club,where two coed saunas (one indoor and another in a retrofitted 1950s teardrop trailer) await. The lounge features cold-plunge showers, a rain fall shower, a heated daybed, and an outdoor patio.

Still, adventure isn’t far away. Located inside theWhitney Peak Hotel,BaseCamp Climbing Gymboasts the world’s tallest artificial climbing wall. The impressive structure rises 164 feet alongside the iconic downtown Reno Arch and offers climbers a clear view of the city’s brightest lights.

“I think it shows the diversity of Reno,” says Kerzhner. “This is not your average city.”

Opportunities to connect with nature aren’t far:Fort Churchill State Historic Parksits in the high desert, and harkens back to a time when wagons heading west sought safe harbor along the way.

WesternNevada’s charm lies in its dualities: Exciting cities and quiet towns. Vast plains and buzzing downtowns. Calm waters and imposing mountains. Exploring them on an itinerary like this one is a chance to recharge and reconnect—mind, body and soul."
66,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/photo-ark-baby-animals,"Tigers and monkeys and tapirs, oh my! Joel Sartore's latest book, ""National Geographic Photo Ark: Babies,"" captures the animal kingdom's most curious youngsters.

Of all the images I’ve taken for the Photo Ark over the past 18 years, people often ask me, “What’s your favorite?” I smile and say, “The next one.” I’ve got to care about all creatures great and small, after all, and can’t afford to discriminate.

But secretly, I think immediately about one image in the back of my mind. It’s odd, because the photo is as simple as can be, but to me it stands above the rest.

It’s the baby Malayan tapir at the Minnesota Zoo.

I often think about the day I met her. I was at the zoo to photograph other species, but as I wound down for the day, a couple of the zookeepers insisted I get a photo of their new baby, just six days old. I told them I already had an adult Tapirus indicus, shot at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo many years earlier, and that I’d never finish the Photo Ark if I documented all the baby animals.

Still, the keepers pressed on, so we made our way across the zoo and into a maternity stall in the tapir holding area. Everyone had huge smiles as they watched me round the corner, and for good reason.

There, in a simple room filled with straw, stood mother and child, as if they were expecting me. The mom, named Bertie, had been eating a bit, while the baby, named Amirah, stood there looking at me. And my heart just melted.

The young one was tiny, not much bigger than a loaf of bread. Not only was she cute, but she was also unlike anything I’d ever seen. Though Bertie was half white and half black, just as adult Malayan tapirs are famous for, her baby was black as night and covered with white spots and stripes. I couldn’t believe my eyes.

This was no accident: Mother Nature designed these markings for good reason. In the wild, when lying down on a forest floor dappled with spots of sunlight, this baby would literally disappear. And because baby tapirs spend all day waiting for Mom to return from feeding, this camouflage is perfect for hiding from predators. The baby would look just like Mom in a few months, once large enough to fight (and flee) on her own.

The shoot took only a few minutes, then I headed out to my car. I kept right on smiling, though, thinking about how lucky I was, both that the keepers urged me to take pictures and that I’d witnessed something few ever get to see. That baby tapir has turned out to be one of the Photo Ark’s most popular animals over the years.

Beyond that moment in 2011, I’ve thought ever since of how fortunate I’ve been to be the guy who’s building the Photo Ark. I’ve literally had a front-row seat to the wonders of nature, young and old, big and small. Every day, I’m thrilled and amazed by who stares into my camera lens, especially when they’re newly minted.

I’ve also learned that cuteness has zero to do with the mechanics of survival in the wild. While the tapir exhibited one strategy for hiding, there are myriad ways to overcome the vulnerability of youth. As I see it, if you’re a youngster in this dog-eat-dog world, you have three main methods to make it: You can blend in, take off, or let your parents defend you.

Hiding makes a lot of sense for many animals. Shorebirds often scrape a simple depression in gravel or sand, then lay eggs that blend right in. Once hatched, their chicks are nearly as speckled and are camouflaged too. You literally can have a nest between your feet and miss it. Aquatic invertebrates can vanish under rocks on the floor of a streambed. Young geckos blend perfectly into the moss on a tree.

Running off is another option. Ungulates like wildebeests and zebras go from newborn to walking in minutes. Precocial birds from ostriches to prairie chickens hatch, dry, and are ready to follow Mom soon after. She’ll teach them what to eat, how to shelter from storms, and how to escape from the bad guys.

To me, baby mussels are the most interesting of all. Mom coaxes a stream fish to come close by making a lure from her own flesh that looks tasty, like a worm or even a small fish. But that lure is a Trojan horse, filled with her tiny larvae. If a fish takes the bait, thousands of microscopic baby mussels explode out. Though only a handful are lucky enough to attach to the fish, those that do grab on will fall off their host weeks later to start a new life somewhere else. Mussels can’t really move on their own, so this is their ingenious way to move the species upstream.

Then there’s the way we humans and many mammals do it: longterm parental care. Like the baby tapir, newborn tigers stay put to nurse from Mom. Adults bring the youngsters solid food until they’re old enough to hunt on their own. Monkeys, opossums, and bats literally carry their young around, providing safety and teaching moments along the way. Orca, dolphin, elephant, and gorilla offspring stay with their parents for years, just like we do.

All these strategies may seem obvious, but every one of them has been honed over time, handed down through thousands of generations. If it works, it stays. If not, it’s gone. Simple as that.

And finally, one more baby story, from Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium.

I’d long wanted to get a shot of an African savanna elephant against a white background, but it took a baby to make it happen.

67,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-winter-experiences-to-have-in-iceland,"From chasing the Northern Lights to hiking across awe-inspiring glaciers, these eight experiences allow you to enjoy the beauty of winter on this wild and varied island.

The distinct landscapes of Iceland offer an extraordinary setting for a winter adventure. In the colder months, you can enjoy the mountains, volcanoes and half-frozen waterfalls without the crowds found in the summer and find a sense of peace in Iceland’s dramatic natural locations. While Iceland’s winter days are short, the nights are long and dark, and locals have always found ways to enjoy them — relaxing in natural hot springs, trying to capture the majestic Northern Lights with their cameras and enjoying fine dining in Reykjavik’s restaurants. Here are eight can’t-miss winter experiences to have in Iceland.

Take advantage of the dark skies and lack of light pollution by searching for Iceland’s nocturnal jewels: the Northern Lights. According to Icelandic tradition, the phenomenon is a sign of good luck, particularly for those about to embark on a journey or major life event. The best time to see the Northern Lights in Iceland is on a cloud-free night between September and mid-March. Joining a tour gives you the best chance of finding them, as guides will take you to their favourite locations and share photography tips.

One of the country’s most accessible glaciers, Sólheimajökull is an hour-and-a-half drive from Reykjavik on the south coast. The glacier is known for its distinctive black streaks, which were formed when ash from eruptions of the nearby Katla and Eyjafjallajökull volcanoes settled on the ice, and were later covered in layers of snow. Sólheimajökull is an easy half-day hike, but it's always best to travel with an experienced local guide, so you'll be in safe hands as you traverse the crevasses and heavily-packed ice. Prepare to marvel at the swirling shapes and captivating blue patches on the ancient ice.

(Is Iceland Really Green and Greenland Really Icy?)

Iceland’s most famous highway is Route 1, a circular road that takes in the whole island starting in Reykjavik. Driving this route is an adventure at all times of year, but even more so in the winter, when skies are full of stars and the aurora lights your way. The route will take you past shimmering frozen waterfalls, dormant volcanoes, snow-covered pastures and fields of shaggy Icelandic ponies. Small group trips are available year-round withAldu Experience, during which local guides will provide insight into the area's history and culture — from picturesque fishing villages, such as Hofn and Stykkisholmur, to Reynisfjara, Iceland's famous black sand beach.

Iceland’s volcanoes have erupted frequently since 2023 and show no signs of slowing down. Take a journey into volcanology at theLAVA Centrein Hvolsvöllur, close to the famous Eyjafjallajökull volcano in south Iceland. Here, you'll learn about the systems monitoring seismic and volcanic activity, and discover how these forces shaped the Earth. Alternatively, head out to see the country's volcanic sights first-hand on guided hikes.

What would you expect to eat in Iceland? Probably not a home-grown tomato. AtFriðheimar Tomato Farm, ingenious farmers have harnessed the power of geothermal energy to heat greenhouses and grow fruits and vegetables you’d otherwise never expect to see this far north. It’s a typically Icelandic approach to life: inventive, playful and quite out of the ordinary. At the farm's restaurant, the tomato soup is a firm customer favourite.

Iceland’s popular Golden Circle route, encompassing the key sights of Geysír, the Gullfoss Falls and Thingvellir National Park, can get busy. For an equally impressive, quieter alternative, head off the beaten track on theSilver Circle, a day-long adventure that takes in waterfalls Hraunfossar and Barnafossar; the historic Reykholt Valley, formerly the home of the author of several Old Norse sagas, Snorri Sturluson; and theKraumahot springs.

Iceland is so far north that it’s not unusual for the sun to set in the middle of the afternoon in winter. While it might cut your sightseeing short, it also allows for one of the island’s most memorable experiences: unwinding in a hot pool under the stars, watching the steam rise as snow falls all around you. As well as the famousBlue Lagoon, there’sSky Lagoon, just outside Reykjavik, where you can swim and experience the seven-step Skjól Ritual, which guides you through Icelandic bathing culture. Alternatively, sink into a Viking-age thermal spa atHvammsvík Hot Springs.

The traditional Icelandic feast, Thorrablót, takes place from late January to late February. It's a time where Icelanders gather together and celebrate the country's rich history and food traditions, with dishes including blood pudding, sheep’s head, rotten shark and pickled ram testicles. Try some of these classic Icelandic dishes atKaffi Lokiin Reykjavik. If such options sound slightly too adventurous, the city is also home to multiple fine-dining establishments, along with two Michelin-starred restaurants,ÓxandDill, which serve world-class modern interpretations of traditional Nordic food.

68,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/the-masterclasses-practical-tips-to-succeed-as-a-travel-photographer,"From pitching publications to finding the right light, the winter series of The Masterclasses byNational Geographic Traveller(UK) saw an expert panel of photographers reveal their top tips for making it.

In January 2025, The Masterclasses by National Geographic Traveller (UK) returned, with four dedicated online sessions followed by a special live event held at London’s National Theatre, all aimed at helping aspiring travel writers and travel photographers sharpen their skills.

For each photography session an expert panel ofNational Geographic Traveller(UK) contributors focused on a different aspect of the skill set, with the likes of Sophia Hsin, Annapurna Mellor, Celeste Noche and Jonathan Stokes sharing practical advice on everything from getting pictures published to building a portfolio.

Here are nine of the best tips for budding photographers, courtesy of some of the brand’s most experienced contributors.

“The more things that you can do, the more likely you're going to be hired by lots of different companies. You're a more all-around package and this has become more and more important. It's great to have a niche and have something that you're passionate about, but in today’s landscape you have to be more versatile and flexible — more willing to shoot different things and try different things.”—Annapurna Mellor

“Try to find the light that's available to you in that place. Sometimes you don't have your ideal light, but I think you should still take photos even if your perfect light isn't there. And you can think about how the absence of light can also help tell your story and help inform your photos —sometimes harsh bright sun is all that's available to you, but also what makes a photo.”—Celeste Noche

“Every time I'm on set [with another photographer] I'm always like, oh, this person lights differently, they work with different gear or technology. Shadowing is an amazing way to learn and get outside of your own routine. Never stop learning, it applies to every single industry.”—Sophia Hsin

“The main way that your work is out in the world is through your website. Be really selective about your images — only feature your best images. Think about separating your portfolios… maybe you really love travel photography, but you’ve also shot some restaurants or even weddings. Your second online portfolio is your social media. Keep your social media up to date. In my opinion, it should be a professional space like your portfolio, but it should also show more of your personality.”—Annapurna Mellor

(How to Become a Nat Geo Photographer)

“When I’m approached with a brief, I like to do some of my own research. I look into where I'm going and what I think I'll be doing and make Pinterest boards. And it can really give you a great insight. A bit of research helps me to build on what's been done before and [enables me] to inject my own take on it with light.”—Jonathan Stokes

“People will like you for your artistic style, so that's really important. Build your style, but also have people look over your brand because, I find that as the artist yourself, you’re the worst at knowing how to talk about yourself or positioning. I really have loved and appreciated my mentors.”—Sophia Hsin

“You never know when your personal projects will lead you to other opportunities. And I think that the best photos you're ever going to take are the ones that you're genuinely interested in. If you're looking to do more professional work, your portfolio should include things that you're really interested in and what you would like to be hired for versus what you think they want. So focus on the internal.”—Celeste Noche

“Don't underestimate connection and what it can mean to engage with folks. The people that you come across can really help shape what it is that you experience and how you tell that story of it, and how you approach your photographs. When you can connect to the humanity of the people of a place, it comes through in your photos.”—Celeste Noche

“It's useful to study magazine layouts and design if you want to shoot for them. It’s a way to visualize how your pictures are going to be displayed and think about how you compose them and light them.”—Jonathan Stokes

69,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/european-red-wood-ants-impact,"The engineering and defensive skills of red wood ants help the endangered species transcend its small stature in the natural world.

Wildlife photographerIngo Arndt discovered his first enormous ant mound as a child exploring the forest with his father near their home in Germany almost 50 years ago. They were bird-watching and came around a bend in a densely wooded area when there it was: a five-foot-tall mound, jutting upward like a large stalagmite. The mound was covered with a thick layer of spruce needles and throngs of tiny redants.

Arndt wanted to investigate more closely, but a very particular smell suggested he rethink that impulse. The air felt thick and pungent, stinging his nostrils like vinegar. “All my life,” he says, “I could remember the smell.”

(This photo was included among the best wildlife photos of 2024.)

As an adult, Arndt has spent much of his career traveling to photograph animals like the pumas of Patagonia and kangaroos in Australia. Several years ago, he moved to the German countryside with his wife. While hiking through the region’s pine forests, the surroundings rekindled his fascination with the mounds and their armies of ultrasmall engineers. How did insects roughly a quarter of an inch long build such huge structures? And why did they emanate that astringent odor?

(These ants are the first known animals to use moonlight to find their way home.)

Arndt now had the tools and experience to seek answers to his questions. Outfitted with a high-resolution camera and macro lenses that allow you to focus on small objects up close, he began photographing the mounds and sharing his imagery with researchers for a scientific perspective. It turned out the mound makers were indeed special. They were red wood ants—scientifically classified as a group within the genusFormica—one of the smallest of all so-called keystone species.

Among conservationists, keystone species such as elephants and sharks are watched closely because their behaviors affect so many aspects of their ecosystem that if they disappeared, it would struggle to adapt. Red wood ants are typically found in Eurasia’s temperate and boreal forests. But in recent decades, more nests have been disappearing as the forests have fallen victim to logging, urbanization, and wildfires, as well as drought and higher temperatures that have become more frequent with climate change. This has led several countries across the ants’ range, including Germany, to designate them as a protected species by law.

Today Arndt’s photo quest has taken on new meaning. His images, which he’s been producing for the past two years, put on display these creatures’ fascinating ability to forge a multitude of symbiotic relationships across a variety of plant and animal species. In doing so, he’s revealed the wonders of a hidden insect world.

The massive NESTS consist of two parts, one aboveground and one below, which red wood ants create by both burrowing into the earth and gathering needles, leaves, bark, and twigs. As they rise, each mound gains new entrances and corridors, supporting anywhere from 30,000 to upwards of 16 million insects, the largest aboveground nests of any ant species in the world.

To learn more about this concealed society, Arndt enlisted the help of entomologist Bernhard Seifert, of the Senckenberg Natural History Museum’s research institute in Frankfurt, and zoologist Jürgen Tautz, professor emeritus at the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg. The researchers helped explain how Arndt’s images showed the ants directing life within the forest in surprising ways.

(These ants perform life-saving amputations on each other.)

For instance, the ants generate formic acid in a venom gland at the rear of their abdomen. As they build a nest, the insects will gather tree resin, which has been shown to possess antimicrobial properties, and spray it with their acid, which has its own antimicrobial properties. The result is a more potent agent that the ants place throughout the structure to fight against bacterial and fungal pathogens.

Formic acid also powers the species’ pest-control role. The fluid can be weaponized to take down other insects, like wood-boring beetles, one of the most destructive vermin in spruce forests. The fighting tactic, Seifert explains, involves “biting them and then spraying formic acid into the wounds.” Reducing the number of beetles that weaken and destroy trees improves conditions for aphids living in them. The ants “milk” the aphids to excrete honeydew, which becomes their primary food source.

(Ants make ‘milk’? This new discovery took scientists by surprise.)

Using camera traps, Arndt also captured larger animals lining up to get sprayed voluntarily. A rare image shows a Eurasian jay landing on top of a mound and calmly flattening out its tail to allow the ants to crawl up and attack. “The ants spray the jays as an enemy,” says Tautz. While the birds appear unharmed, the toxin is powerful enough to disperse or kill parasites, such as mites and lice, that they carry. For many bird species, this behavior helps them stay healthy too.

Some uninvited guests that are willing to reek alongside the community have gained more benefits. As social insects, ants organize colonies and form complex societies, but they also cohabitate with a wide variety of species, including mites, spiders, and flies, within their nests. One trick is that some of these interlopers may have grown up already doused in a familiar scent.

If a leaf beetle drops its eggs on or near the mound, the workers may inadvertently bring the eggs into the nest while collecting materials. “The larvae actually live inside it,” Arndt explains. The eggs, then the larvae, and eventually the pupae all smell like the nest. That’s how they elude their hosts’ detection and exploit the shelter to survive. In one study, researchers confirmed that, on average, more than a dozen different species can be found within a single mound.

Arndt’s project highlights the strange and amazing ways these often overlooked creatures are influencing the action around them. While he did his best to avoid disrupting the protected species, the ants at times had other ideas and they’d hitch a ride back with him.

“I’ll be out at dinner, and they show up and walk over my pants,” he says, laughing at the memory. “But I always try and bring everybody back to the nest.” The forest needs their collective power.

(These ant 'portraits' reveal how diverse and beautiful these insects are.)

70,National Geographic,Photography,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/lifestyle/article/best-cell-phone-accessories,"From mini lenses that capture professional-quality photos to a portable printer, these cellphone accessories enhance any trip.

There’s no denying that as travelers, we rely on cell phones for a myriad of tasks, from the practical to the creative.

“Aside from the primary purpose of my phone, which is communication, I normally use it for storytelling. Either by taking photos, filming B-rolls for my video content, or even vlogging,” saysNoel Guevara, a conservation photographer, filmmaker, producer, and National Geographic Explorer based in Manila, in the Philippines.

It makes sense, then, to add cellphone accessories to your travel kit. From photo lenses to straps and even a color printer, the best cellphone accessories maximize your phone’s potential and enhance any trip. Here are our favorite additions.

For starters, a phone case helps protect your device from drops or water, which is especially important if you’re exposed to the elements. If you’re heading overseas, then a universal portable charger can keep your phone powered up no matter where you go. For road trips, a car mount is great for handsfree navigation and safety.Read on for more top tips.

A multidevice charging station like the Lion Eclipse saves luggage space. This one has fast-charging USB (A and C) ports, a high-capacity 20,000 milliampere-hour (mmAh) battery, and a wireless charging pad.

“As a hiking and trekking guide, a power bank is an invaluable travel tool,” saysMeeta Singh Rao, a guide from Uttarakhand, India. “I am often walking in remote Himalayan villages where power cuts and electricity shortages are frequent, so this helps me stay connected and safe.”

As a travel photographer, I found this charger very handy on a recent trip when I needed to charge my camera battery in the field. The LED display conveniently shows the remaining battery life, so you always know how much power you have.

While this portable charger is packed with features, it’s worth noting that it weighs two pounds, which might feel a bit heavy for some travelers. Additionally, it lacks a clip or strap for hands-free carry. On the plus side, this TSA-approved device can be fully recharged from a wall outlet in as little as 1.5 hours, ensuring minimal downtime.

(These are the best portable chargers and power banks)

Like the name suggests, the OtterBox 3-in-1 charging station with MagSafe lets Apple users charge several devices at once. The magnetic array hangs onto your phone and charges quickly (up to 15-watt) in either portrait or landscape mode—most useful if you want to use the phone while it’s charging.

This stand-like charger helps cut down on cable clutter, and because it comes with a 36-watt wall charger and USB-C cable, you don’t have to worry about compatibility. The weighted base and magnetic alignment are powerful enough to keep devices firmly in place, helping to ensure there are no accidental disconnections.

One downside is that this stand doesn’t fold, which can make it a bit awkward for packing. However, you can get it into a corner in a purse or carry-on. Overall, this is a reliable charging station for quickly powering multiple devices at once.

The iSteady Smartphone Stabilizer is a great tool for achieving professional-quality videos with your phone. “A stabilizer is a way to avoid jumpy video,” saysEric Goldring, a travel writer and owner of a luxury expedition travel agency. “They also work to make taking photos and videos a bit easier, as you do not have to awkwardly hold the phone.”

One of the best features of the iSteady is the 360-degree infinite horizontal pan axis for capturing smooth shots from any angle. It even has a magnetic, reversible AI vision sensor that has face tracking capabilities. This means your subject will always be in focus.It’s also got up to 18 hours of battery life, according to the brand.

Balancing the gimbal may take some practice for anyone new to using one. Additionally, at 1.2 pounds, this stabilizer can feel heavy after a while.

A lighter (and less expensive) option is thePeak Design Mobile Tripod. Made from anodized aluminum, it’s about the size of a credit card and sets up with any MagSafe-compatible phone and case. The legs double as a handgrip for selfies or handheld filming, and the anti-slip prongs keep it steady on almost any surface.

“At its most basic level, it eliminates the need to ask another person to take your photo. Just put your phone on a timer, and you’re good to go,” says Guevara.

Phone straps are ideal for keeping your phone secure, yet within easy reach. Goldring is a huge fan of phone straps. “I always recommend it to my clients as I have seen many mobile phones being lost overboard, … dropped in the snow, or down a cliff,” he says. “It just offers peace of mind knowing it is secure against your person.”

The OtterBox 2-in-1 Crossbody Strap connects to OtterBox cases via built-in anchor points. The strap converts from a wrist band to an adjustable crossbody. It also has attachment points to hook small items, such as keys or earbuds.

This phone pouch may appear delicate, but it’s watertight and offers reliable touchscreen functionality underwater. I have used it while snorkeling in the Maldives and for taking underwater photos during my daughter’s high school water polo match with flawless results.

The lightweight design makes it ideal for camping or hiking, where every ounce matters. The dual locking mechanism securely clicks into place. Each order comes with two cases in various colors, and the pouch is spacious enough to fit phones up to 8.3 inches, including the phone case—a major convenience in the field. I also appreciated the adjustable lanyard for keeping my phone accessible.

(Get the perfect shot with expert-approved camera tripods)

A phone wallet that stashes your phone, plus cards and cash, is a great way to save space in your carry-on or personal bag. This wallet is MagSafe and holds up to three cards. Best of all, it integrates with Apple’s Find My network, so you can track your wallet if you misplace it.

While the magnets are strong, the wallet can detach if it’s bumped the wrong way. Slots for just three cards may be a downside for some.

We also like thePeak Design Mobile Wallet, which is available in two versions. The sleek Slim Wallet holds up to seven cards but doesn’t fold out into a stand. For that, try the Stand Wallet, which works in both portrait and landscape modes. Both wallets are crafted from weatherproof, 100-percent recycled nylon canvas.

71,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/pope-francis-funeral-vatican-catacombs-crypts,"The earthly remains of most of history’s 266 popes (plus some European royals) are buried in Rome—in dozens of catacombs and cemeteries in, under, and around the city.

Rome may be the Eternal City, but popes are mere mortal men. The earthly remains of most of history’s 266 popes over the past1,961 years are buried in Rome, in dozens of crypts, catacombs, and cemeteries in, under, and around the city.

The very first was Peter,who began his life as aGalilee fisherman named Simon and became one of Jesus Christ’s first disciples. According toChristian tradition, Peter was crucified in the year 64 after a lifetime of traveling and preaching and was buried in a necropolis, or city of the dead, outside Rome’s city walls on the far side of the Tiber River. The remains of that necropolis were discovered directly under St.Peter’s Basilica in the 1930s,and another sectionunder the Vatican walls has just opened to visitors.

Peter’s earliest successors as bishops of Rome were leaders of a tiny sect persecuted by the Roman Empire. They were interred in secretin underground catacombs excavated many stories deep into the soft rock along the Appian Way. These tombcomplexes, which stretch literally for miles under rolling suburban countryside, are dark, fusty, and damp with endless corridors andsteps descending ever deeper. Though the thousands of burial niches have been cleared of human remains, it's easy to imagineearly Christians cowering for their lives in these burial grounds by torchlight as Roman soldiers searched for victims to execute in thearena.

It was the first Christian Roman emperor, Constantine, who erected a church over the reputed place of Peter’s burial. Today, rebuiltseveral times with increasing grandeur, the spot is marked by Michelangelo’s towering St. Peter’s Basilica. As the premier church ofthe Catholic world, the vaults of St. Peter’s—which were given an orderly Renaissance makeover in the 16th century when the mainbasilica was rebuilt—are the ultimate VIP burial place not only for over 90 popes but also for European royalty. (Seven popes missedtheir slot in St. Peter’s due to exile when the papacy fled to Avignon, France, for much of the 14th century.) Pope Julius II, famouspatron of Michelangelo, is buried in St. Peter’s, but oddly his monumental tomb is in another place entirely.The huge monument, onwhich Michelangelo worked for nearly four decades, was judged too grand by Julius’s jealous successors, who ordered the tombconstructed across town at the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, empty of its intended occupant.

But of all the papal remains in St. Peter’s, those of Pope Formosus, who ruled from 891-96, have had the most postmortem adventures. Seven months after his death, Formosus’s successor, Stephen VI, had his body disinterred, dressed in papalvestments, and put on trial for usurping the papacy. Despite the efforts of a deacon appointed to defend the dead primate, Formosuswas found guilty, and his body then stripped of the garments and dressed in rags. The three fingers of his right hand, with which he oncegave blessings, were cut off, and his body was cast into the Tiber. But the body washed up downstream, and the waterloggedcorpse was reported still to be performing miracles. A public uprising deposed and imprisoned Pope Stephen, who was strangled inprison in 897, at which point Formosus’s remains returned to St. Peter's.

Exiled monarchs Queen Christina of Sweden and the Stuart pretenders to the English throne are also buried in St. Peter's, and anassortment of royalty lies in a tiny enclave right next to the basilica known as the Teutonic Cemetery.During the long (and still open) investigation of the disappearance of Vatican resident Emanuela Orlandi—who vanished as ateenager in 1983–an anonymous tip-off after years of fruitless leads took police to the Teutonic Cemetery. In the search for the girl’s body,two graves of 19th-centuryGerman princesses were opened in 2019, but the graves were completely empty. There was no trace of Orlandi—orof the princesses. The mystery remains unsolved.

And now Pope Francis has joined his 265 predecessors. Francis was, famously, a breaker of stuffy Vatican traditions. On hiselection as pope in 2013 he insisted on riding the bus with his fellow cardinals back to their hotel, and also on paying the bill. Herefused to move into the lavish state apartments in the Apostolic Palace, choosing instead a guesthouse on the Vatican grounds.And he opened the grand papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo in the hills south of Rome to the public rather than live in ithimself.

No surprise, then, that Francis’s arrangements for his own funeral broke the mold. He wanted his departure from the Vatican to be aslow-key as his arrival.

Papal funerals have traditionally been regal affairs—quite literally, because until the middle of the 19th century, Rome’s popes werealso the temporal kings of a large chunk of central Italy. Even Francis’s predecessor Benedict XVI was buried in three coffins ofcypress, lead, and elm loaded with sacks of papal coins for each of the years of his reign and displayed on a raised catafalque in St. Peter’s Basilica.

No such pomp for Francis, whose body lay in state for three days in St. Peter’s in a plain wooden coffin placed at floor level.

Most surprisingly, Francis willed that he be buried not in St. Peter’s but in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore—or St. Mary Major—on the Esquiline Hill, the first pope to be interred there since 1679. St. Mary Major's was built in 432, a year after the Council ofEphesus declared Mary to be Theotokos, or “Bearer of God.” The stunning mosaics from that period are among the oldestrepresentations of the Virgin Mary in the world, and a venerated Byzantine icon of her is housed in the basilica’s Pauline Chapel.More modern, and more controversial, moments of church history are also built into the fabric of the basilica. The vast 16th-centurywooden ceiling is covered in some of the first gold brought back from the New World by explorer Christopher Columbus. As well as being the final resting place of seven popes, the basilica is the burial site of Cardinal Bernard Law, former archbishop of Boston, who became infamous for hisrole in covering up child sexual abuse by priests.

Pope Francis’s attachment to St. Mary’s goes back to the beginning of his pontificate, when he started a tradition of prayingthere before and after every one of his hundred-plus foreign trips. He also made a point of praying for peace—most recently, for anend to the war in Ukraine, in 2022—by a statue of the Virgin in the basilica commissioned by a predecessor in 1918 and known asthe Queen of Peace.

During one visit to the church Francis noted an intriguing door, which gave him an idea for his last resting place. “Just beyond thesculpture of the Queen of Peace, there's a small recess, a door that leads to a room where candelabras were stored,”Francis saidin his 2024 bookEl Sucesor (The Successor),a long interview with journalist Javier Martinez-Brocal. “I saw it and thought: 'This isthe place.’ ”In his final testament, solemnly read out after his death, Pope Francis asked to be buried “in the earth, simply, withoutparticular decoration” and with the inscription only of his papal name in Latin: Franciscus. The costs of the burial will be borne by “abenefactor” rather than by the church, Francis specified.

Death, burial, and rebirth are central elements of the Christian faith. Rome has seenempires, kings, and popes come and go. It has also seen its fair share of strange and controversial papal funerals (and, inFormosus’s case, reburials). Even if some elements of Francis’s funeral might be unusual by papal standards, he is nonethelessfollowing firmly in the footsteps of a tradition with roots two millennia old.

72,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/maya-tikal-altar-child-sacrifice-teotihuacan,"Child sacrifice was thought to be rare in their culture. This chilling discovery suggests foreign invaders played a role.

Archaeologists excavating the ruins of the Maya city of Tikal have unearthed a 1,600-year-old altar likely used for human sacrifices, surrounded by the bones of children.

The grim discovery adds weight to the idea that Tikal was ruled at this time by overlords from the non-Maya city of Teotihuacan, more than 600 miles west in what’s now Mexico; and some of the sacrifices may have been efforts to ensure Teotihuacan’s power over the local people.

“The local dynasty, which was Maya, was allowed to continue, but under the heel of a foreign group,” says Brown University archaeologistStephen Houston. In anew studyin the journalAntiquity, Houston and his colleagues describe the altar and human remains unearthed from the ruins in what’s now Guatemala. The researchers think the altar was used for sacrificial rituals, and that the buried people were probably victims. And several clues—child sacrifice, grave artifacts, and altar paintings—point back toTeotihuacan.

The find challenges the idea that Teotihuacan’s influence at Tikal was gentle and mainly through trade: “This has a highly intrusive and violent nature to it,” Houston says.

The painted altar was once located within a sacred precinct near the center of Tikal, where powerful people from Teotihuacan are thought to have lived.

Studies of the overgrown ruins withlidar (Laser Detection and Ranging)show the precinct featured buildings modelled on those at Teotihuacan, including a huge pyramidal temple.

The altar was found during excavations of a plaza north of the temple that Houston and other archaeologists from Guatemala and the United States have been investigating since 2019.

The discovery strengthens the theory that the Teotihuacan regime, based in a distant city in a foreign land, instigated a coup or conquest of Tikal in the late 4th century.

Initially, Tikal and Teotihuacanseem to have traded with each other, and the “Teotihuacanos” — as experts call them — may have used this trade as cover to spy on the Maya.

“Tikal had lots of resources, beautiful plumes of feathers, chocolate…this was a ‘Land of milk and honey’ to them,” Houston says.

Tikal was then one of the most important cities in the “Maya lowlands,” in present-day Yucatan and Chiapas in Mexico, Belize and Guatemala.

(A1,700-year-old sacrificial monkey may have been a diplomatic gift to Teotihuacan.)

The idea of a Teotihuacan coup or conquest at Tikal originated in the 1960s, notes Penn Museum’sMexico and Central America gallerycurator Simon Martin, an expert on Maya writings who was not involved in the latest study. Archaeologists found Mayan petroglyphs at the site that reported the A.D. 378 arrival of a “foreigner” called Siyaj K’ak’, a warlord whose Mayan name meant “Fire is Born.”

Siyaj K’ak’s ethnicity isn’t known, but the Tikal petroglyphs record many Teotihuacan names in his entourage. They also record that the previous Maya king of Tikal “died” on the same day that Siyaj K’ak’ arrived; after which a new king was installed named Nun Yax Ayin (Mayan for “First Lord Crocodile”) who may have been the son of Teotihuacan’s ruler.

Tulane University archaeologist and National Geographic ExplorerFrancisco Estrada-Belli, who was also not involved in the new study, says some scholars have proposed Tikal was ruled after this by a social class of Teotihuacan priests.

But the nature of the occupation isn’t clear, he says: “It may have been an oligarchy, or some form of corporate form of government, but we don’t know.”

Martin thinks the Teotihuacan occupation of Tikal may have featured alliances with local people opposed to the previous regime.

He says it seems the precinct at Tikal was “mainly ceremonial” and there are no signs of a major Teotihuacan military presence there.

Radiocarbon analysis of incense burners and other burned material found throughout the plaza where the altar was unearthed indicate it was built about the time of the Teotihuacan takeover. The new study also describes the remains of six people that were found during the excavations.

Four of the sets of remains were from young children, including one who was between two and four years old when they died—presumably by being sacrificed—and then buried in a pit directly in front of the altar, in a seated position with their legs drawn-up under their chin. The study notes this type of sacrificial burial was rare at Tikal, but common at Teotihuacan.

The other dead were buried around the plaza or in small tombs nearby. In one of the adult graves, archaeologists found a green obsidian dart made in a Teotihuacan style, and isotopic analysis of the bones suggests that only people from Teotihuacan had been sacrificed there—but just why that would be is not known.

All of the children were under four, and one was less than a year old. The fact many were so young may be a sign they were sacrificed to establish the growth of Teotihuacan’s power in Tikal, Houston says.

(This ancient society tried to stop El Niño—with child sacrifice.)

The newfound altar itself is about six feet wide, four feet deep, and a little over three feet high.

It was built from layers of earth and lime, and was finished with coats of lime plaster. The sides of the altar were then painted in red, orange, yellow and black, on top of designs that were first sketched out in pale red paint.

The final paintings depict the face of Teotihuacan’s god of storms and war, whose name is unknown—although the Aztecs or Mexica called him Tlaloc when they adopted him centuries later.

According to the study, the god can be identified from the stylized fangs in his mouth, an ornament below his nostrils known as a nose-bar, and his oval eyes. His face is painted on the four sides of the altar, wearing necklaces, “ear spools” in his earlobes, and an elaborate headdress made with feathers.

Houston says the ancient paintings are badly degraded after their centuries underground, but the altar’s Teotihuacan influence is still clear: “It’s not done remotely in the Maya style.”

Several technical aspects of the altar paintings indicate they were created by a highly skilled artisan who had been trained at Teotihuacan and later traveled to Tikal. They include the fact that the paintings were sketched out first, as well as their “flat” color fields and the well-defined lines on the figures that had been highlighted in red, the study says.

The Maya civilization thrived at Tikal and in other cities until it declined after about A.D. 900, for reasons that aremuch debated.

Before that, Teotihuacan had also declined, fromabout the sixth century; and Houston says the Teotihuacan precinct at Tikal was deliberately abandoned after that.

“It’s just left as a wasteland,” he says. “It’s almost as though it had some taboo over it, because [the Tikal Maya] had very bad recollections of the past.”

Teotihuacan’s influence remained at Tikal for centuries, however, especially in the Maya city’s artistic traditions, Houston says. And he adds that the Teotihuacan occupation of Tikal, whatever its nature, has helped archaeologists better understand that mysterious city in what became the Aztec lands.

Among the new finds are Mayan glyphs that make the earliest-known mention of what’s now central Mexico, where Teotihuacan was located. “The inscriptions found near the altar refer to ‘the land of the five snow-covered volcanoes’,” Houston says — apparently a reference to the volcanoes Popocatépetl, Iztaccíhuatl, Nevado de Toluca, Ajusco, and Xitle that surround modern Mexico City.

“Teotihuacan does not have a clearly understood writing system, but the Maya do, and they’re writing about Teotihuacan in a way that Teotihuacan never does itself,” he says. “We can use the Maya glyphs to understand what was going on back at the center of Teotihuacan’s empire.”

73,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/kentucky-derby-hats-history-celebration,"America's longest running sports event comes with a distinctive sartorial tradition.

Although horses may be the stars of theKentucky Derby, hats take center stage at the 151-year old horse race in the American heartland.

In Kentucky, hats—the wilder the better—are central to the annual spring ritual, the “run for the roses.” On the first Saturday of May, horse-racing fans gather at Churchill Downs to watch the “most exciting two minutes in sports.”

Big, bold, and steeped in tradition — here's everything you need to know about the history of hats at the Kentucky Derby.

The Kentucky Derby is the first leg of theTriple Crownof horse racing, which includes thePreakness StakesandBelmont Stakesraces. The racetrack, located in Louisville,Kentucky, was founded by Col. Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr., the grandson of William Clark—who along with Meriwether Lewis explored the western portion of the U.S. in what is known as the Lewis and Clark expedition—after he toured prim, royal tracks while on a trip throughout Europe.

Thefirst Kentucky Derbywas held in 1875, making the race the longest continuously-held sporting event in American history. That year, African American jockeyOliver LewisrodeAristide, a three-year-old horse, in record time to win the first-ever Kentucky Derby. Thirteen of the 15 jockeys were African American during the inaugural Derby and about 10,000 people attended the coveted event.

(Why America’s greatest racehorse still dominates the track today.)

The Kentucky Derby’s pageantry—from the broad hats to the tailored suits—is central to the race by design. Clark and his wife Mary, a socialite, promoted the Derby as a well-to-do affair. It was “a great hoity-toity event for the rich and famous to come and mingle and see each other in their finest,” says Jessica Whitehead, a collections manager at theKentucky Derby Museum, a Louisville-based organization dedicated to the history of the race.



Ladies’ fashion was never overlooked. At the turn of the century, local newspapers would print an alphabetical list of who wore what to the Derby—detailing which fabrics and colors were trending.

Hats were a staple of everyfashionable outfitin the region until the 1960s, so for the first century they weren’t a notable accessory. As hats faded from the norm they were still worn to special occasions like the Derby. Over time, they became associated with the race as a tradition for “tradition’s sake,” theorizes Whitehead.

The audacious hats of today’s races emerged as the race became televised, according to Derby historians. To stand out from the crowd, women began wearing louder and more extravagant hats. Today, remarkable hats are still featured on television stations across the country.

Women find inspiration for Derby hats from all over the world, from Australia’s racing tracks to theRoyal familyand their notable, if sometimes audacious, hats.

Customers bring in photos from royal weddings requesting hats similar to those worn by Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, says Rachel Bell, a co-owner of the specialty hat shop in Louisville, Kentucky,The Hat Girls. She says that the royals are responsible for the majority of their sales shifting from hats to fascinators, headpieces that are “fastened” to the head via comb, clip, or headband.

(Read how speedy horses only evolved recently.)

“When you see two princesses that everyone idolizes and you see them wearing fascinators, they want to wear them too,” says Bell.

While horses were onlydomesticated 6,000 years ago, humans have been donning hats forat least 27,000 years. From function to fashion, hats have been worn for centuries for nearly every occasion. During bitter winters, shepherds in Turkmenistan turned to shaggy telpek hats to stay warm. In Brittany,France ladieswore lacey caps as a nod to the region’s history of lace artistry.

Queen Elizabeth,who woremore than 5,000 hatsduring her more than 70-year reign,hadestablished a following for her race-day headwear. The Queen, who owned and bred horses herself, also openedthe Royal Ascotraces in Berkshire, England. Each year, attendeesbet on what color hatthe Queen would wear on opening day.

When the Queen attended theKentucky Derby in 2007, she wore a fresh green and coral hat.

“The derby is all about the hats—the horses are second,” says Bell.

74,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/how-a-new-pope-is-elected,"Who gets a vote? What do those smoke signals mean? And is there really as much intrigue as depicted in Hollywood? Here’s what you need to know about papal succession.

With thedeath of Pope Francisat the age of 88, the world will now turn to a pressing question: Who will be the next pope—and how will he be elected?

After Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation in 2013, it took two long weeks for the Catholic faithful to find out who would be their next representative of God on Earth.

Crowds in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican let out a cheer as the white smoke from burned ballots signified a successful vote among the members of the College of Cardinals.It was the final act that sealed the intricate papal selection process that allegedly dates back to the time of Jesus Christ.

Here’s a closer look at the real story behind one of the Vatican’s most mysterious and time-honored processes.

The pope was originally the bishop of Rome, a position first held by Saint Peter (one of Jesus’ 12 disciples), according to the Catholic Church. The Petrine theory states the authority given to Peter from Christ (when he took the position in A.D. 30) has subsequently been handed down to each pope since his tenure.

(The centuries-old Catholic doctrine that encouraged colonization.)

Peter was considered a papa, a Latin term used by Christians out of filial respect. At the time, the same title was used by esteemed churchmen throughout Christendom. The exclusivity over the word papa—from which ""pope"" derives—was not claimed by the bishop of Rome until the sixth century. Papal primacy, the concept that the pope is the church’s highest leader, became inextricably linked to the papa in Rome, elevating the bishop of the city over all other bishops.

Popular opinion, both of clergy and worshippers, was used to elect popes until the 11th century. Obviously, there was rarely a consensus. This led to disputed elections and antipopes—individuals with substantive, albeit false, claims to the papal seat.

Pope Nicholas II issued adecree in 1059articulating the process by which popes would be elected going forward, outlining the role of cardinal bishops as the electors. Nicholas II himself took the positionbetween twoantipopes, showing just how contentious papal succession was. The decree of 1059 lessened the influence of the Roman aristocracy and lower clergy and laid the foundation for the College of Cardinals, formally established in1150.

Criteria for candidates, voting regulations, and the need to sequester electors were formalized, only to be altered and adjusted as flaws in the system became clear.

The need for a two-thirds majority vote began in1179. The number of cardinals went from no more than 30 during the later Middle Ages to 70 in1586. More than four centuries later, Pope Paul VI set the maximum number of voting cardinals to 120 in 1975. The current age limit for voting cardinals was set at 80 years of age in1970. With every pope, the number of cardinals increases—today, there are 222 cardinals with 120 eligible to vote. By the end of the year, eight more will be ineligible to vote as they celebrate their 80th birthday.

(Pope Francis’s gift to a grieving photographer.)

When a pope dies or resigns, all members of the College of Cardinals are obligated to attend the election (called the conclave), barring poor health or exceeding the age limit. Resignation is the exception rather than the rule, however. Before Benedict XVI's resignation in 2013, the last pope to resign did so in 1415.

Once the papal see is vacant, the official papal conclave begins within 15 to 20 days of the last pope’s departure. This length of time was established in1922to allow cardinals sufficient time to travel to proceedings.

Cardinals are all electors of the next pope—and technically all of them are candidates too. When the cardinals arrive in Rome, they are each assigned a ""titular"" local church to oversee and hold Mass at during their stay. It's also an avenue by which cardinals make their faces and names known to the world.

Akin to a final campaign stop for a politician, the Sunday before a conclave makes for ""an odd scene"" according to author and papal expertJohn Thavis. Thavis explained in 2013 that papal contenders are ""very careful not to say anything that appears to be campaigning.""

Once the College of Cardinals officially convenes, they are sealed in the Sistine Chapel until a new pope is chosen (barring extraordinary circumstances). They swear an oath to maintain the integrity of the conclave—secrecy is of utmost importance and only a few attendants are allowed to have any contact with voting cardinals.

Preparation of the ballots (called “pre-scrutiny”) involves distribution, completion, and the designation of ballot collectors and counters. Casting one's vote (“scrutiny”), is done in secret.

During “post-scrutiny,” votes are tabulated, reaffirmed, and then burned.

An initial vote takes place on the first day. If no one is elected, a maximum of four votes for each subsequent day of the conclave is held, with each unsuccessful group of ballots burned afterward. If three days of voting offers no new pope, members of the conclave take a full day for prayer and contemplation. If that four day cycle repeats seven more times, a run-off between the two candidates who received the most support is held.

The burning of ballots, or fumata, is the public's clue as to what has actually taken place within the confines of the Sistine Chapel during the conclave. In order for smoke to be seen at all, a temporary stove and chimney areinstalledin the Sistine Chapel before the conclave starts. It's not entirely clear when thepracticeof burning ballots began, but white smoke as a sign of a new pope only traces to the late 19th or early 20th centuries. An unsuccessful ballot, when burned, sends off black smoke.

Until 2005, the Vatican added natural materials like wet straw (for white) and tarry pitch (for black) to the ballots. It wasn't until 2013 that the Vatican revealed the chemicals they adopted in 2005 for the purpose: a mix of potassium chlorate, lactose and conifer resin for white, and potassium perchlorate, anthracene and sulfur for black.

Four plumes of black smoke were seen in 2013 before white smoke finally appeared. Mere hours before that white smoke rose from the Vatican, a solitary white seagull perched itself atop the chimney. Observers took this to be a hopeful sign that the wait for a new pope was nearly over. They were right. Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio (Pope Francis) had been elected to the position by his peers.

75,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/eridu-sumer-ancient-city-discovery,"Excavations on unpromising mounds in the Iraqi desert revealed Sumer’s earliest city. Surviving relics and a rebuilt temple have given experts more clues about the ancient metropolis of Eridu.

Buried in the Mesopotamian desert, undisturbed for over two millennia lay a hidden key to understanding one of the world’s oldest known civilizations.

In 1854 British official John George Taylor was sent on an excavation mission to the desert of southern Iraq by the British consul general in Baghdad. Taylor, an agent of the East India Company and British vice-consul at Basra, was commissioned with investigating a remote site called Tell Abu Shahrain, where there was a series of tells, or mounds, made up of debris left by human settlements. At first, Taylor was unimpressed. In the excavation report published in 1855, he wrote: “My visit this year to Abu Shahrein [sic] has been unproductive of any very important results.” He even questioned whether it had been worth transcribing his field notes.

Taylor had been hoping to uncover something impressive: statues, inscriptions, evidence of palaces and temples. What he found instead, in the short time he had available, were walls, drainage systems, stone platforms, and the remains of limestone columns decorated with mosaic cones.

In his journal, Taylor highlighted finding a statue of a black granite lion lying on the surface. Even counting the lion, however, Taylor must have thought this too meager a haul to justify a second expedition. Only later would it be revealed how these unpromising mounds were the remnants of one of the oldest cities on Earth: Eridu.

Eridu was a foundational city in Sumerian culture, the world’s earliest known civilization, which flourished from around the fourth to second millennia B.C. in what is now Iraq.

(This ancient society helped build the modern world.)

Eridu’s significance is evidenced by the Sumerian King List, various versions of which were inscribed in cuneiform toward the end of the third millennium B.C. The latter part of the list includes cities with royal dynasties that can be verified from historical records. The early part of the list is more legendary, recording the original royal cities that existed before “the Flood” (an event that may reflect a regional catastrophe or may be related to the biblical story in Genesis where the whole Earth was flooded). The first of these antediluvian royal cities was Eridu: “After the kingship descended from heaven, the kingship was in Eridu ... In five cities, eight kings ... Then the flood swept over.”

Of immense symbolic importance, Eridu was also home to the largest temple dedicated to Enki, the god of water and wisdom, a key deity of the Sumerian pantheon. For centuries, this shrine attracted pilgrims from all over Mesopotamia to Eridu.

Despite Taylor’s disappointment, his initial findings piqued the interest of scholars. Although no large-scale excavations were carried out in the decades that followed Taylor’s visit, officials at the British Museum remained interested in the site. In 1918, just before the end of World War I, museum officials commissioned Assyriologist Reginald Campbell Thompson to carry out excavations at the site. For a month, Campbell made archaeological surveys, using Ottoman prisoners of war as laborers. The following year, British Egyptologist Harry R.H. Hall arrived with the aim of identifying the site’s monumental buildings.

It was not until 1946, however, that the first large-scale excavations began. Iraq had gained independence from Britain in 1932, and the Iraqi government was keen to fund archaeological projects that might lend prestige to their nation-building narratives.

At the end of World War II, the Department of Antiquities of Iraq relaunched research at the site of Eridu under the direction of Iraqi archaeologist Fuad Safar, assisted by British archaeologist Seton Lloyd. Safar and Lloyd knew each other well, having worked together at Tell Uqair, near Baghdad. They believed that fully excavating Eridu could byield important data on the earliest phases of Mesopotamian history.

They concentrated their efforts on Mound 1, an 82-foot-high tell covering an area of some 1,900 by 1,770 feet. Before long, they uncovered the remains of an unfinished ziggurat, or step pyramid, built at the end of the third millennium B.C. by a ruler of the 3rd dynasty of Ur, a late, short-lived Sumerian state. But what really intrigued Safar and Lloyd was what lay hidden beneath the remains of that ziggurat.

(They were scouting for oil in Iran. They found an ancient temple instead.)

They were not disappointed. Beneath remains dating to the Ur III (21st century B.C.) period were more levels of human occupation.

As they dug further, they hit a stratum dating to the Uruk period (4500–3200 B.C.). Below that were remains from as far back as the protohistoric, pre-Sumerian Ubaid period (5300–3800 B.C.) As they worked, they found multiple reconstructions of the temple of Enki, made over the course of two millennia, along with other places of worship.

Italian Mesopotamian historian Mario Liverani writes that Eridu’s temples were “reconstructed and expanded after each collapse, and their remains formed a raised platform on which new temples were constructed.” As the temple of Enki was repeatedly rebuilt on the same site, its structure evolved.

According to Liverani, new iterations of the temple became progressively larger from the middle of the fourth millennium B.C.: “These imposing buildings ... by far superseded anything ever built until then.” Their emergence marks a transition from worshiping at home to worshiping at specially built places. In parallel with this process, there is evidence of more complex social hierarchies emerging in the city.

The reconstructions of the temple stopped around 3200 B.C. A millennium later, with the brief return of Sumerian power under Ur III, the ziggurat would be erected on the ruins of all that had gone before.

(The ancient empire that civilization forgot.)

Although Eridu declined, it continued to have relevance, probably as a place of pilgrimage. Excavation of surrounding tells provided more clues to the timeline. Mound 2 contained the remains of a palace complex dating to the first half of the third millennium B.C. Mounds 3, 4, and 5 contain pottery dating to the second and first centuries B.C. but no remains from residential buildings. The city was only sparsely populated by that time.

Safar and Lloyd’s research was finally published in 1981. Despite the political instability of the region, Italian and French archaeologists seek to resume excavations at Eridu, the first city of the earliest civilization, and reveal more secrets.

76,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/pope-francis-life-in-photos,"During his groundbreaking papacy, Pope Francis inspired the masses as he challenged the traditions and standards of the Catholic Church.

Pope Francisalways had an eye on thefuture. From the outset he recognized the need for a shift within the Catholic Church, which had lost the trust of many in recent years. His calls for change could be inspiring to many yet divisive to others as he ushered in transformational ideologies and a less formal period for the papacy.

As formality was thrust aside, older Catholic traditions were also reevaluated. In 2013, Francis named numerous women to roles high within the Vatican administration. When asked about the sexual preferences of priests, the pope replied, “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?” Pope Francis gave traditionalists within the Catholic Church pause, but subsequent statements insupport of same-sex civil unionsand about the “unjust” criminalization of homosexuality attested to Francis’s vision for the future of the church.

Francis also challenged the status quo by encouraging that the clergy make a place within the church for divorced and remarried Catholics. He urged them to “offer understanding, comfort and acceptance” to single mothers, “rather than imposing straightaway a set of rules that only lead people to feel judged and abandoned.”

In accordance with Pope Francis’s hope for global harmony and cooperation, he issued a call to action for all Catholics to protect the planet—“God’s creation”—in the face of environmental crises. And despite referring to himself as a “dinosaur” when it came to computers, Pope Francis broke ground for the papacy by taking part in numerous online events, launching theVaticaninto the digital age and connecting with millions of his flock.

77,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/black-history-in-country-music,"Artists like Beyonce and Lil Nas X are drawing mainstream attention to a tradition that is alive and well—thanks to the contributions and innovations of generations of Black musicians.

As Beyoncé kicks off herCowboy Carterworld tour, her embrace of country music is reigniting conversations about the genre’s Black roots—and the pioneers too often left out of its history.

Since Beyoncé previewedCowboy Carterduring her Super Bowl commercial and released the album in March 2024—the second act of herRenaissancetrilogy—the cultural response has been electric. The Grammy-winning album spotlights the long-erased contributions of Black musicians to country music and has sparked renewed curiosity in that legacy.

“It’s awakened such a discussion,” says Francesca Royster, an English professor at DePaul University and author of the 2022 bookBlack Country Music. “Students, friends, old friends from college have been calling, wanting to talk about this topic that, for a long time, has felt like a closet obsession.”

While many contemporary music listeners’ first experience with Black country music came withLil’ Nas X’s 2018 “country-trap” novelty hit “Old Town Road,” Black folks have been writing, performing, and recording country music since it first became popular in the 1920s. In fact, country music wouldn’t exist as it does today without the contributions and innovations of Black musicians.

“One of the biggest lies this nation has ever told is that Black people are not country,”wrote culture critic Taylor Crumptonin the days following Beyoncé’s announcement. “Black people have always lived in the country. It is where we prayed. It is where we sang. It is where we worshiped.”

As more young and emerging Black country artists receive critical attention and accolades, there’s hope that this represents a step toward a more inclusive representation of country music—rather than just a passing trend.

The presence of Black folks in country music, while not quite universally acknowledged, is not exactly a secret. TheCarter Family, often called the “First Family of Country Music,” drew heavily on the playing style ofLesley Riddle, a Black blues and gospel guitarist and folklorist. As a boy in the 1930s,Hank Williamslearned from Black guitar playerRufus “Tee Tot” Payne, just asJohnny Cashwould later learn from musicianGus Cannon.

Black harmonica playerDeFord Baileywas the first performer on the Grand Ole Opry and helped turnNashvilleinto a country music mecca. Thanks to the tireless advocacy work of musiciansRhiannon GiddensandDom Flemons, we know about the banjo’s African roots and its prominence in early Black folk music. Plus, musicians such asCharley PrideandDarius Ruckerbroke numerous barriers as two of the first African American country music superstars.

But what isn’t as often acknowledged is how Black singers, across all genres, have historically dabbled in country. Beyoncé is by no means the first.Ray Charles,Solomon Burke,Bobby Womack,Esther Philips,Otis Williams,Millie Jackson, andTina Turner(to name a few) have recorded country albums. More recently, rap and R&B artistsLudacris,LL Cool J,Nelly, andSnoop Dogghave each collaborated with country music superstars. Still, the myth that Black people aren’t part of country culture has persisted.

(A mecca for rap has emerged in the birthplace of jazz and blues.)

“As a country music fan, I did not feel safe in country music spaces,” saysBlack Opryfounder Holly G. “It is not confusing to me that Black people have been hesitant to come into this space.”

For decades, the country music industry—and many white fans—have reinforced exclusion, whether through decisions about whogets charted, whogets airplay, or the continued presence of Confederate flags at festivals (a practice only recently banned).

Launched in 2021, Black Opry began as a website highlighting Black country, folk, and Americana artists. A year later, Holly and Tanner Davenport cofounded the Black Opry Revue, an artist collective that performs around the U.S.

“I’m hoping that now, their eyes will be opened to the fact that there is a way to consume it safely and with people who look like you,” says Holly.

Holly remembers how, in the months before starting Black Opry, she would search online for ‘Black country artists,’ and the same few names would appear. Even today, most media attention continues to fall on a handful of megastars—Kane Brown,Mickey Guyton, and Darius Rucker—but today’s field of Black country music is manifold.

While emerging artists likeDalton Dover,Michael Warren,Chauncey Jones,Rodell Duff, andAaron Vanceskew toward a more traditional and acoustic country sound, other singers such asBreland,Willie Jones,RVSHVD, andTanner Adellare melding trap and R&B elements with country—a musical alchemy that can be heard on Beyoncé’s “Texas Hold ‘Em.”

Twenty-seven-year-old singer and songwriterReyna Roberts—who borrows equally from country, rock, and pop—attributes her distinctive sound to the broad scope of music she’d been exposed to as a child. “I grew up listening to country, trap, hip hop, classical music, pop, everything,” she says. “But, as a songwriter, I realized that a lot of the songs I was writing were country songs.”

Roberts says she’s seen a dramatic increase in listeners and social media followers following Beyoncé’s Super Bowl announcement, gaining close to 400,000 new followers.

Other Black female country and roots artists, like Adell, who released the trap-country “Buckle Bunny” in the summer of 2023, andLinda Martell, the first black female solo artist to play the Grand Ole Opry, have also seen sharp increases in streams and downloads since 2023.

(Here’s how the Harlem Renaissance helped forge a new sense of Black identity.)

Black Opry’s Holly G. remains cautiously optimistic that Beyoncé’s visibility will encourage fans and industry leaders alike to recognize the deep bench of Black talent in country music today.

“There’s so much diversity even within Black country music,” she says, “and that’s what I hope people are eventually able to see and take away from this.”

78,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/new-york-1977-blackout-i-love-ny-logo,"In 1977, with dozens of fires set daily and tourism in freefall, New York hired an artist to save the city. His infamous sketch in the back of a yellow cab became the most imitated logo in history—and cities are still copying it today.

In the summer of 1977, New York City was burning. A 25-hour blackout, triggered by lightning striking key transmission lines, led to widespread looting, riots, and more than a thousand fires.

That night alone, the fire department battled blazes across Harlem, Brooklyn, and the South Bronx, a shocking surge in a city already averagingfour dozenfires a day. New York City was at an all time low.

But what saved the city wasn’t a bailout or sweeping reform. It was a simple sketch—drawn in the back of a yellow cab by designer Milton Glaser. His now-iconic “I ❤️ NY” logo became a rallying cry, a symbol of pride at a time when the city was desperate to believe in itself again. “It was the perfect storm of need and meaning coming together,” saysSteven Heller, a design historian and formerNew York Timesart director who has chronicled the logo’s cultural legacy.

New York’s decline didn’t happen overnight. First, the factories closed, causing300,000 manufacturing jobsto vanish in just six years. Wealthy residents fled to the suburbs, taking with them their tax dollars. The city started borrowing money to make payroll.

Then came the budget cuts. Teachers got pink slips. Sanitation trucks sat idle as garbage rotted on street corners. “The city was closing fire departments because it didn’t have the money to maintain them,” says Ryan Purcell, a history professor at Sarah Lawrence College and the creator of theSoundscapes NYCpodcast. “They chose which neighborhoods to abandon.”

(Here’s how New York has changed—through the eyes of someone who never left.)

Crime spiked to more than a thousand murders annually, and arson became a business model. “Landlords were burningtheir buildings to collect insurance,” says Purcell. “It was more profitable than collecting rent.”

The South Bronx lost more than97 percent of its buildingson some blocks to flames and abandonment. It became the epicenter for what officials coldly called “planned shrinkage,” a controversial urban planning strategy that pulled services from poor neighborhoods to force depopulation.

By 1975, police handed visitors pamphlets titled “Welcome to Fear City,” at every entry point to Manhattan—Grand Central, Penn Station, Port Authority—warning tourists to stay away until things change. Subway cars were coated in graffiti and plagued by breakdowns.

When the city begged Washington for help, theDaily Newscaptured President Ford’s infamous response:FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD.“If ‘I Love New York’ came about and nobody felt that New York was worth saving, it might not have worked,” says Heller. “But people loved New York and wanted it to be a better place.”

Summer 1977 brought new horrors. The Son of Sam serial killer was taunting newspapers with chilling letters, and a sweltering heat wave pushed the power grid to its limit. At 8:37 p.m. on July 13, lightning struck a power station in Westchester County. New York went dark.

(Can we fix the infrastructure that powers our lives?)

The following 25 hours set records with a thousand fires, 1,600 stores looted, and 3,700 arrests. Damage topped $300 million.TIMEmagazine eventually dubbed it “The Night of Terror,” while outside observers called New York ‘the new Rome in decline.’

The blackout forced a reckoning: the city didn’t just need more police or cleaner streets—it needed a comeback story. One that could make people believe in New York again.

Faced with a full-blown image crisis, New York’s Department of Commerce turned to advertising agency Wells Rich Greene with an impossible task. “They were trying to rebrand the city away from this climate of fear,” says Purcell. What emerged would change design history.

The campaign began with three simple words:I Love New York. William S. Doyle, the state’s deputy commissioner of commerce, asked native New Yorker Milton Glaser to create the visual identity. Though originally designed for a state tourism campaign, the logo quickly came to represent the city’s soul.

Glaser was already a giant in the design world—co-founder of New York Magazine, the mind behind psychedelic Bob Dylan posters, and a designer who brought fine-art sensibilities to commercial work. The fee was $2,000, but Glaser never cashed the check.

(This the forgotten history of New York’s first electric taxi fleet—in the 1800s.)

His first attempt played it safe withno symbolsand clean typography. But Glaser had a breakthrough a week later, riding in a taxi. As the cab lurched between potholes, he pulled a red crayon from his pocket and sketched on the back of an envelope: bold stacked letters with “I” on top, a red heart in the middle, and “NY” beneath, replacing the word “love” with the universal symbol. The inspiration came from the carved initials of young lovers in tree trunks.

“It was a visual pun,” says Heller. “He took something so common it was almost invisible—how people wrote ‘I love you’ in yearbooks and greeting cards—and applied it to this definitive idea that we all love New York.” The heart carried all the weight.

What made the design extraordinary wasn’t just what it said—it was how quickly it communicated feeling. In a moment of despair, it offered something rare: hope.

New Yorkers initially met the campaign with skepticism. “When that slogan first appeared, Son of Sam was still killing people,” says Purcell. “But as it filtered into municipal publications and tourism materials, people began to see the change it represented.” Hotel occupancy rose through 1978. Tourism numbers rebounded.

The design drew its power from perfect timing. “The logo gave New Yorkers permission to show civic pride before they truly felt it,” says Purcell. Once it caught on, it wasn’t just advertising. It was an act of resistance—a quiet declaration that their city was still worth loving.

Glaser gifted the design to the state, never trademarking it himself. By 2011, the logo generated $30 million a year in merchandise revenue for New York.

The logo spread organically, finding new life with each crisis. After 9/11, posters across Manhattan declared “I ❤️ NY More Than Ever” with a small black smudge on the heart’s lower left corner symbolizing the wounded downtown. During COVID, the design resurfaced again, modified but instantly recognizable.

“Milton knew [the logo] had relevance and resonance with everybody who looked at it,” says Heller. “Like Robert Indiana’s LOVE sculpture, it ended up having a life of its own.”

The logo resonated because it didn’t just rebrand the city. It reminded New Yorkers that love could be a rallying cry even in collapse. A message that, as Heller says, “will never go away.”

79,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/what-archaeology-can-tell-us-about-jesus-crucifixion,"From the location of the “place of skulls” to ancient Jewish burial rites, here’s what archaeologists do—and don’t—know about the truth behind the Easter story.

The death and resurrection ofJesusis the most famous underdog story in history. A low-status artisan from Galilee challenged the authorities of his time and ended up dying a brutal and horrifying death. But only a few days later, the Bible says, he was vindicated and resurrected from the dead. The story inspires billions of Christians around the world, but how much hard evidence is there for the historical events that started a global religion?

From a historical perspective, theEaster storyis tremendously well attested. And the fact of the crucifixion is one of the most well documented elements of the Jesus narrative. It is mentioned in the letters of the Apostle Paul (the first texts to be written down by followers of Jesus in 50-65 CE), described in some detail by all four canonical Gospels, and referenced by non-Christian writers in the second century. While early Christians didn’t like to depict Jesus on the cross, asecond-century CE piece of graffiti—mocking a Roman who worships a donkey-headed man being crucified—has a good claim to being our earliest image of Jesus, albeit a satirical one.

But the specifics of the Easter story are more contested, especially as later generations extrapolated impossible details and expanded the legend.

For centuries, Christian pilgrims have retraced Jesus’s path along theVia Dolorosa, or “Way of Sorrows,” the 600-meter route that tradition says Jesus travelled from his sentencing to his death. Yet while Jesus had to get to Calvary somehow, pilgrims are not walking in his actual footsteps.

In the Bible, Jesus is sentenced to die in a “praetorium” a Latin word for the general’s tent in a military encampment. Modern historians identifyHerod’s Palaceas the most likely location for this praetorium and, thus, the place from which Jesus was taken to his death. The foundation walls of the palace were unearthed in 2001 in an abandoned building next to the Tower of David Museum in Jerusalem. The Via Dolorosa, on the other hand, begins in the Antonia Fortress in a completely different part of the city.

From the palace and Pilate’s praetorium, Jesus is said to have journeyed to Golgotha—the “place of the skull”—for crucifixion. If he was able to walk then it is likely that Jesus, like other ancient criminals, was forced to drag the crossbeam used in his execution. But he would not have carried an entire cross, as medieval art would have it. It was simply too heavy. An entire cross is likely to have weighed about 300 pounds while the crossbeam would have been approximately 75-90 pounds. When Roman authors refer to people carrying crosses, as the playwright Plautus did in his comedyThe Charcoal Burner, they explicitly refer to thepatibulumor crossbeam.

(What we know about Jesus of Nazareth)

The last stop on the Via Dolorosa is theChurch of the Holy Sepulchre, in Jerusalem’s Old City, which is built on the traditional site of the crucifixion. Most victims of crucifixion were bound to their crosses with rope rather than nails, a detail that cast some scholarly doubt on the accuracy of the Gospel story. But in 1968, archaeologist Vassilos Tzageris excavated some tombs in the northeastern part of Jerusalem anddiscoveredthe remains of a crucified first-century man with a nail still lodged in his ankle. A second example from outside of Venice,publishedin 2019, offers our only other surviving piece of archeological evidence for crucifixion in practice. While we have numerous literary accounts of crucifixion, particularly the mass execution of the followers of Spartacus in 71 BCE, these are our only two pieces of archeological evidence for crucifixion. Nailing is unusual but not unparalleled.

The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is also believed by Christians to house Jesus’s tomb. The idea that Jesus was buried close to the place of his crucifixion comes from the Bible. The Gospel of John states that there was a garden “in the place where Jesus was crucified” (John 19:41) and that Jesus was buried in a new tomb there because it was nearby. Visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre today and you can see the specific locations associated with the place of crucifixion, the place Jesus was laid out and prepared for burial, and his tomb (enclosed in a shrine called the aedicule). The Church is a holy place for Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Armenian, Coptic, Syriac and Ethiopic Christians.

(How did Jesus’ final days unfold?)

For 19th-century Protestant biblical archeologists, however, the identification of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as the place of Jesus’s execution was less certain. The Church was built by the emperor Constantine in the fourth century, some three hundred years after the events. The crucial point for its authentication is whether it sat inside or outside the walls of the city during the life of Jesus. Ancient Greeks, Romans, and Jews viewed corpses as unclean and buried their dead outside of the city. It’s inconceivable, therefore, that Jesus was executed inside of the city walls. While in Jesus’ time the Church lay outside of Jerusalem, the expansion of the city over the following centuries meant that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was swallowed up by the metropolis.

Concerned about the relative position of the Church and the city walls and convinced that the biblical reference to Golgotha must refer to somewhere else, biblical archeologist and Christian war heroCharles Gordonidentified a hill a mile to north of the Church as the place of the crucifixion. A nearby tomb, known as the Garden Tomb, was then identified as the place of burial. To this day, thousands of evangelical Christians celebrate Easter at the site.

There is, however, no way that the Garden Tomb is the tomb of Jesus. The Gospelssuggestthat Jesus was laid in a newly constructed tomb made for Joseph of Arimathea (Matt. 27:57-60). In 1986 archeologist Gabriel Barkayshowedthat the alleged Garden Tomb dates to the Iron Age, preceding the crucifixion by hundreds of years. As religion scholar and public educator Andrew Henryputsit, no critical scholar today thinks that the Garden Tomb is the authentic site of Jesus’s crucifixion and burial.

(How ‘Good Friday’ got its curious name)

For those who think that the location for the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was more about convenience than accuracy, the most plausible alternative site for the crucifixion is the quarry located near the Gennath (Garden) Gate mentioned by the ancient historian Josephus. In an importantarticle, New Testament scholar Joan Taylor argued that Golgotha does not refer to a skull-shaped rock or hill but to a quarry to the west of the city. She suggests that Jesus was executed here alongside a road. This location, she argues, would fit the usual Roman practice of crucifying criminals where they would be seen by others. That way their deaths could serve as a deterrent to passersby and potential rebels.

The Gospels tell us that once Jesus had died, shortly before sundown onGood Friday, he was taken down from the cross and buried. But not everyone agrees. New Testament scholars John Dominic Crossan and Bart Ehrman have disputed this detail and argued that Jesus was not buried at all. Their argument is rooted in Roman practice and the fact that Romans regularly denied criminals proper burials. Instead, they often left bodies on the cross as a warning to travelers. When the corpses were removed, Crossan and Ehrman argue, they were unceremoniously tossed into ditches or mass graves. The theory strikes at the heart of Christian beliefs: If Jesus was never properly buried then the subsequent stories about the empty tomb and resurrection must be a fiction.

Though Ehrman and Crossan present a compelling case, and some criminals were left to rot in full view of the public, the situation may well have been different in 1st-century Jerusalem. The historian Josephuswritesthat Jews were so careful about funeral rites that “even malefactors who have been sentenced to crucifixion are taken down and buried before sunset.” In the case of Jesus, who was executed at the start ofPassover, Pilate may well have wanted to keep the people happy by removing the bodies before sundown.

(The High Priest behind Jesus’ rigged trial)

Assuming Jesus was buried, where was he taken? The Gospels say that a follower of Jesus named Joseph of Arimathea requested Jesus’ body from Pilate and that he buried Jesus in his newly constructed family tomb. Though we cannot prove that this happened, noted archeologist and historian Jodi Magnessconcludesthat this version of events “accord[s] well with archeological evidence and with Jewish law.” Tradition maintains that Jesus’s tomb was close to Calvary. Most scholars agree that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre has as strong a claim as any to be the place of his execution and burial.

This brings us to the biggest question of all: what is the evidence for the resurrection? According to the Bible, Jesus was resurrected three days after his death and burial. The Gospels agree that the tomb was empty and told stories of supernatural appearances byangels(Mark 16:5) and the risenJesushimself (John 20:14). As a story, the resurrection is less unbelievable in the 1st century than in the present. Stories of dying and rising gods—like Osiris, Dionysius, and Mithras—were well known in antiquity and most people in in the ancient world believed that the dead were in contact with the living after they passed away. As Meghan Henning, a professor of New Testament and Christian Origins at the University of Dayton,toldNational Geographic, “Today, if someone says they spoke to their dead mother we would be concerned, but in antiquity we would have asked ‘oh really, what did she say?’”

But what actually happened? Here history cannot help. When archeologists brieflyopenedthe tomb of Jesus in the aedicule of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 2016 they found it empty, as one would expect. (One does not have to be particularly that cynical to think that 4th-century Christians would select an empty tomb as their pilgrimage site regardless of the truth of the matter). Some ancient critics of Christianityhypothesizedthat the body of Jesus had been stolen. Othersspeculatedthat Jesus disciples—and particularlyMary Magdalene, the first to see the risen Jesus—were hysterical. One modern scholar has more charitablyclaimedthat the disciples were experiencing the kind of vision or hallucination people see after the death of a loved one. All we can say for certain about the resurrection is that from the very beginning, Christians believed it.

80,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/racehorse-stallion-lexington-kentucky-derby,"Lexington, the most legendary thoroughbred of the 19th century, left a genetic legacy throughout the Kentucky Derby. Here's how his DNA still shapes modern horse racing.

“Best Time ever Made” declared the headline in theLouisville Daily Courieron April 4, 1855. Two days earlier, at a racecourse inNew Orleans, a champion thoroughbred named Lexington had run four miles in seven minutes, 19 and three-quarter seconds, smashing the previous record by more than six seconds.

Lexington’s blazing speed record would stand unmatched for 20 years. But a severe infection had left the stallion blind in one eye and nearly so in the other. No longer able to race, he was sent to a stud farm, where he earned even greater renown.

“Lexington sired a powerful lineage filled with champions today,” saysKim Wickens, author of a forthcoming book on the legendary racehorse. “He was the most dominant horse of his day and passed those genes down to a phenomenal line of winners, including War Admiral, Citation, Secretariat, Affirmed, and Justify.”

Twelve of 13 winners of the covetedTriple Crown, a trifecta of races consisting of theKentucky Derby,Preakness Stakes, andBelmont Stakes, are descend from Lexington.

Lexington’s greatness traces back to a partnership that was highly unusual in the antebellum South. His first owner,Elisha Warfield, was a prominent Kentucky obstetrician who delivered thousands of babies, including futureFirst Lady Mary Todd Lincoln. In 1821, he opened a stud farm and became so devoted to breeding, training, and racing thoroughbreds that today he’s remembered as the “father of the Kentucky turf.”

Lexington was born on Warfield’s farm in 1850. Originally named Darley after an illustrious Arabian stallion, he was big and strong like his father—another legendary thoroughbred who won 40 of 45 races—but he needed the guiding hand of a trusted track sage.

Enter Harry Lewis, an African American born intoslaverywho grew up to become a highly esteemed horse trainer. A painting from 1835 shows an impeccably dressed Lewis standing beside an impeccably groomed thoroughbred.

“If they were good,Black trainers and jockeysenjoyed a certain amount of liberty in the South,” Wickens says. “They moved about more freely because of their horsemanship skills. Still, they were treated about the same as the horses.”

But Lewis was a horseman of exceptional talent, and by 1850 he had earned his freedom. Known to turfmen across Kentucky as Old Harry, he was just the man Warfield needed to turn his promising young colt into a champion racer.

(Why the Kentucky Derby is a celebration of hats.)

“Warfield wouldn’t have turned over his prized thoroughbred to just anybody,” Wickens says. “He would have been familiar with Lewis’ reputation, who had trained the champion racehorse Richard Singleton, as well as other winners.”

By 1853 the aging Warfield was in failing health, and his wife insisted that he ease back on running the horse farm. So he agreed to lease Darley’s racing rights to Lewis, who set to work training the young stallion.

In those days thoroughbred racing was a grueling endurance sport. Whereas today horses may sprint a mile, back then they might run four—and they had to win two races to earn the title of champion. It was not uncommon for a steed to run eight to 12 miles in a single afternoon of exhausting competition.

While Lewis put Darley through his paces, Warfield offered advice from afar. His wife had issued strict orders that he abstain from the daily rigors of horse rearing, but he still found a way to stay involved.

“He’d sneak upstairs to the attic of his home with binoculars so he could watch Darley being trained and raced at the track next to his farm,” Wickens says.

For two men of opposite races to work together in the then slave state of Kentucky surely raised eyebrows. The unusual pairing occurred at a time when tensions were high as the nation edged closer toCivil War. What made their partnership possible?

“We don’t know the exact nature of their relationship,” Wickens says, “but I’m betting it was one of mutual respect.”

Their combined efforts paid off for both men. Darley won his first set of races with such distinction thatRichard Ten Broeck, a New Orleans racetrack owner, told Warfield to name his price. They settled on $5,000—equivalent to nearly $200,000 today.

But the event included a second set of races four days later. When Darley again finished first, a dispute arose over who was entitled to the purse, Ten Broeck or Lewis. In a landmark decision, the racing authority ruled in Lewis’ favor. He collected $2,150, almost $85,000 today.

Ten Broeck took Darley to New Orleans and, in keeping with the custom of the day, renamed his new horse Lexington, in honor of his hometown. The powerful thoroughbred went on to win four of his next five contests—many of them arduous four-mile events—before faltering eyesight cut short his racing career. Retired to a stud farm, he sired more than 230 horses who won nearly 1,200 races.

When Lexington died in 1875, the celebrity stallion was given a lavish funeral and buried in a custom-built coffin. His massive skeleton was later exhumed and today is reverently displayed at theInternational Museum of the Horsein Lexington’s namesake town.

81,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/pope-francis-dies,"Pope Francis has died after serving as pope since March 2013.

Pope Francis passed away at the Vatican on April 21, after leading the Catholic faithful since March 2013. Hiselectionas pope was characterized by firsts: He was the first man from outside of Europe to become pope in more than 1,200 years, the first supreme pontiff from South America, and the first member of the Jesuits to preside as bishop of Rome.

As head of the Holy See, Francis broke much new ground, and his leadership represented a significant shift in the office itself, focusing on bridging the widening gap between the elite administration of the Catholic Church and its flock. He also pioneered new approaches to long-held Catholic traditions and practices.

(Take a close look at Pope Francis's first visit to the United States.)

Francis’s upbringing, training, and practical experience set the foundation for his path through the church hierarchy. Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on December 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the future pontiff was a trained chemical technician. When a young man, he became afflicted with a life-threatening pulmonary illness that led to a partial lung removal. But it was after Bergoglio went to confession as a high school student that he received a call to serve God.

Formallyordainedas a Catholic priest in 1969, Bergoglio studied theology in his native Argentina before undertaking spiritual training in Spain.

Once back in Argentina he made his final vow to the Jesuit order on April 22, 1973, and became the provincial superior of the Society of Jesus soon after. During the 1980s and 1990s Bergoglio served as rector of his alma mater, Facultades de Filosofía y Teología de San Miguel, traveled abroad to continue his own education, and held numerous positions within the institutional church. In 1998 he became archbishop of Buenos Aires, and he was appointed cardinal byPope John Paul IIin 2001.

Throughout his career Bergoglio emphasizedsocial justice, community engagement, and solidarity among Christians and non-Christians alike. He rejected anything resembling extravagance—for instance, opting for public transportation and modest living arrangements, instead of the more elaborate apartments inhabited by his predecessors. His tireless work in the poorest neighborhoods of Buenos Aires even earned him the moniker “slum bishop.”

In 2001 Bergoglio was launched into the global spotlight after theSynod of Bishopswhen he stepped in to serve as relator general. In that position, Bergoglio was tasked with delivering the keynote address and overseeing the texts written on the outcome of the gathering, which often serves as a guide for matters of the church. Bergoglio demonstrated skill and grace at the proceedings after the attacks ofSeptember 11—so much so that it ultimately led to talk of his elevation to the papacy after the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005. But it wasn’t until eight years later, when Pope Benedict XVI resigned, that on March 13, 2013, the College of Cardinals elected Bergoglio as the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church.

Bergoglio entered the papal seat at the age of 76, choosing Francis as his pontifical name, in honor of St. Francis of Assisi. Bergoglio later explained that as the votes of the conclave were counted, his mind turned to the 13th-century saint: “For me, he is the man of poverty, the man of peace, the man who loves and protects creation.”

Pope Francis’s missives, communiqués, and official decrees demonstrated his desire to modernize the church and overhaul aVaticanscarred by scandal. His four encyclicals (letters regarding church teachings addressed to all bishops) outlined his focuses on faith and salvation, the relationship between the environment and religion, the need for cooperation among all humans worldwide, and a call for rediscovering the importance of the heart. Francis soon became a “rock star” to many, followed by millions online and greeted at events by hundreds of thousands of the faithful, bunched in tightly packed crowds and eager for selfies.

(Read Pope Francis's first-ever papal encyclical on the environment.)

Within the Vatican itselfPope Francisworked to diversify the College of Cardinals in an effort to move away from a body composed primarily of Europeans. However, Francis was immune to neither controversy nor criticism, notably being thrust into the ongoing sex abuse scandal in the church. He garnered headlines of both praise and divisiveness for his comments onhomosexuality and same-sex unionsand the practice ofsurrogacy, his role in elevating women within the church, and his less rigid stance ondivorceand contraception, among other topics.

Throughout his papacy Pope Francis emphasized respect for the laity and sought to empower ordinary people everywhere by simplifying the messaging of the church. He endeavored to bring compassion and reconciliation to the forefront of the church’s priorities, and believed in open discussion to foster spiritual and clerical thought. Francis will be remembered for not only reshaping the institution as a whole but also for his unwavering dedication to Catholic faith and community and his unprecedented look to the future in an ever changing world.

82,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/beltane-pagan-fire-festival,"This Celtic celebration of fire and fertility culminates in the marriage of the May Queen and the Green Man—and the arrival of summer.

Each spring, on the night of April 30, thousands gather on Edinburgh’s Calton Hill to welcome the return of summer—with fire. Performers dressed in dramatic costumes move through the crowd, reenacting ancient rituals to drums and chants echoing across the city.

The crowd—locals and tourists alike—comes for theBeltane Fire Festival, Britain’s largest modern celebration of an ancient tradition that honors fire, fertility, and the changing season. Revived in 1988by a group of artists and volunteers, the festival has grown into a high-energy spectacle rooted in tradition but shaped by modern values.

So how did a nearly forgotten pagan fire ritual become one of Scotland’s most iconic annual events?

Beltane (pronouncedBEL-tayn) is one of eight seasonal festivals in the Celtic calendar, alongsideSamhain,Yule, Imbolc,Ostara,midsummer,Lughnasadh, andMabon. Its roots stretch back centuries across Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and the Isle of Man.

Beltane translates to “bright fire,” which is central to the festivities. It celebrates the coming summer sunshine months and the fertility of nature, including the people and livestock that come from the changing seasons.

Historically, everyone in the community would have to put out their individual home fires, and a grand bonfire, known as a “need-fire,” would be lit in the community space. Part of this ritual would include driving cattle between two central “need-fires” to protect their health for the season ahead. After this protection ritual was completed, music, dancing, and drinking would continue late into the night.

“Beltane has long been an important part of Scottish traditions and culture since the pre-Christian/Anglosaxon colonization of the land,” says Romaine Furmston-Evans of the Beltane Fire Society. “When these takeovers occurred in history, traditions like Beltane were adopted by the dominant culture and shifted to suit their means. So, the celebration never really stopped; it was just altered and often renamed. In Beltane’s case, it became May Day.”

Although the repression of paganism and traditional festivals continued throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Beltane didn’t disappear entirely. In 1988, a group of performance artists resurrected the festival’s spirit on Calton Hill. Still run by community volunteers today, the event has grown from a small audience of about 50 in its first year to roughly 10,000 by 1999.

Ross Tinsley, a lecturer at Edinburgh Napier University who has researched Beltane extensively, says, “the group who resurrected it were seeking a release from struggles against the dominant political landscape ofThatcherism.”

Historically, the Beltane celebrations would’ve been celebrated on the slopes of Arthur’s Seat. But because this land is crown-owned—and given the political symbolism—organizers chose Calton Hill, a space known in the 1980s for its connection to queer counterculture.

(This ancient festival celebrates springtime—and a brand new year.)

The story of theMay Queen and the Green Manis at the heart of the modern festival. The May Queen is almost a Mother Earth figure, representing nature. The Green Man tries to get the attention of the May Queen throughout the festival but isn’t successful until he shrugs off his winter coat and embraces the new season. The culmination of the festival is the marriage of the two and the start of summer.

As the narrative unfolds, other characters representing aspects of nature join the performance. The Whites, attendants of the May Queen, embody her emotions and energy. The Blues, elders of the festival, uphold tradition and order. The wild and unpredictable Reds represent nature’s chaos and carnality—and often disrupt the other groups. These roles unfold across Calton Hill over four hours, creating an immersive, interactive experience.

Beltane’s rise in popularity is about more than spectacle. “We are currently seeing a resurgence of embracing indigenous cultures across the world,” says Furmston-Evans. “This is part of Scots reclaiming our heritage.”

(​Paganism ison the rise—here’s where to discover its traditions.)

In part, Beltane’s popularity reflects a growing desire to reconnect—with each other, the natural world, and rhythms that feel older than modern life. “This growth can be seen as a reflection of dissatisfaction with more traditional religion and with the pace of contemporary Western society,” says Tinsley.

According to the Beltane Fire Society website, “The motives behind Beltane are the search of a human primal nature, the need to reconnect with land and nature, the contraposition of the chaotic and wild movements of the elements of life and nature in opposition to the over rationality and disciplinarian order of the central state at that time.”

“Beltane is a festival of hope for brighter times ahead,” says Furmston-Evans, something many find comfort in during uncertain times.

83,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/is-there-a-secret-city-under-the-pyramids-,"Two Italian scientists claim to have discovered 38,000-year-old structures buried deep beneath the pyramids. But there's a big reason to be skeptical.

For the past few weeks, the internet has been abuzz with stories about a secret city allegedly located under thePyramids at Giza. A research team led by retired organic chemist Dr.Corrado Malangaand former academic and remote sensing expert Dr.Filippo Biondi, claim to havediscovered and reconstructedenormous 38,000-year-old structures buried deep underneath the pyramid of Khafre at Giza.

In a press conference held in Italy, Malanga and Biondiannouncedthat through the development of a new proprietary method for interpreting Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals, they were able to detect structures two kilometers beneath the Khafre pyramid. According to Malanga and Biondi, they discovered eight shafts, surrounded by spiral pathways, that connect to two 90-meter cube-shaped structures. Above the shafts, they claim to have found five structures connected to one another by passageways. Using what appears to be AI-generated reconstructions, they, and others, have hypothesized that these structures are part of a legendary ancient city or even a prehistoric power-generating structure (i.e. a power station).

Rumors of hidden structures underneath the Giza plateau are nothing new. The idea dates to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus and intermittently bubbled to the surface of popular consciousness throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance. They became particularly popular among French scholars in the 19thcentury and again in the 20thcentury when American psychicEdgar Caycepopularized the idea that a secret hall of records was buried underneath the pyramid complex. The concept of apower station, allegedly built by aliens, has also been bouncing around pseudoscientific circles for a while. It is part of a broader conspiracy theory that credits impressive ancient architectural projects to aliens.

(How cosmic rays helped find a tunnel in Egypt's Great Pyramid.)

This newest iteration of the pyramid conspiracy theory has captured public attention because of the scientific credentials of its authors. In the past Malanga and Biondi published a peer-reviewed article on the internal structure of the Khafre pyramid. Though these newer sensational claims have not been peer-reviewed, and one of the authors is well known for publishingbooksabout aliens, the combination of doctorates and an allegedly new technology has captured public attention. The story went viral and was picked up by InfoWars, Joe Rogan, Piers Morgan, and other critics of “mainstream archeology.”

“These claims were received by a public primed for such news from long time claims of mysterious, hidden chambers under the pyramid,”saysDr. Flint Dibble, a well-respected archeologist and science communicator who has headed up 3-D digital mapping projects for a large excavation at Abydos in Egypt andteaches at Cardiff University. “And they appeared legit because of the conflation of peer-reviewed research and the degrees that the scholars hold.”

But as other experts have pointed out, the problem with the lost city hypothesis is that it uses an unproven technology, takes imaginative leaps in its reconstructions, and fails to account for what we know about the archeology of the region.

(Who built the pyramids of Giza?)

To begin with, there are the methods involved in scanning the ground beneath the Giza plateau. As Dibble and public archeologist Milo Rossi haveexplained, these methods have never been confirmed or proven, nor have they been independently verified. Synthetic aperture radar only detects up to two meters underground in similar conditions. It is difficult to imagine that SAR is providing credible information about structures 2,000 meters beneath the surface.

To be clear, Malanga and Biondi have not discovered a new way of detecting structures two kilometers beneath the ground; instead they claim to have a new method of interpreting these synthetic aperture radar signals. If one compares the images of the radar signals published in the report with the reconstructions they generated, it is clear how much artistic license is being taken in the interpretation of the images. The technology does not allow scientists to create an entire 3-D model or produce the kinds of cross-sections envisioned in thereconstructions. As Dibble joked with Rossi inone podcast, thereconstructionappears to be based on the reactor room ofTotal Recall.

Alongside public educators like Dibble and Rossi, other established academics have criticized the discovery. ProfessorLawrence B. Conyers, an expert in ground-penetrating radar at the University of Denver,toldtheDaily Mailthat the claims of a vast city are “a huge exaggeration.” Egyptian archeologist Dr. Zahi Hawass, the former Ministry of Antiquities, called the claims “baseless” andnotedthat the Egyptian Council of Antiquities did not grant permits for this kind of study to take place in the Khafre pyramid.

Summing up the interpretative and practical issues, Dr.Sarah Parcak, an award-winning scholar at the University of Alabama who uses cutting-edge satellite imagery to better improve our understanding of Egyptian archeology,said, “I could get any satellite imagery to look almost any way I wanted with enough manipulation… I think that's what these guys, they've done. They've misinterpreted the data. And the satellite imagery … SAR data can't see through rock, period.”

(The pyramids at Giza were built to last an eternity. But how?)

More problematic, Dibble explained, is the study’s curious avoidance of all the archeological data about Giza plateau that was painstakingly collected over the past two centuries. All these studies, which utilized geochemical analysis, satellite remote sensing, seismic refraction, muon scans, electrical resistivity tomography, ultrasonic testing, ground penetrating radar, and magnetometry, have been carefullycheckedagainst one another and in some instancesconfirmed through excavation and drilling into the bedrock. The cumulative weight of this evidence has led to a robust understanding of what lies beneath the pyramids, how the pyramids were built, and when they were constructed.

The most relevant piece of data here is the water table at Giza. An intensive study performed bySharafeldin et al in 2019revealed that the water table at Giza is only a few dozen meters under the surface of the plateau. The proximity of the groundwater, Dibble said, means that even today theSphinxand other monuments are slowly eroding from water that sometimes “wicks” up from beneath the ground. What this means for this new study is that if there really were megastructures some 2,000 meters underneath the pyramids, they wouldalwayshave been part of an underwater city. Think Aquaman’s Atlantis, not Amsterdam, Venice, or even themythical Atlantisthat fell into the sea.

(Meet the anti-Indiana Jones solving the pyramids’ secrets.)

In general, water is a critical part of understanding the life course of the pyramids. The pyramids were built soon after the end of the African humid period when greater rainfall meant that the Sahara was more like a verdant savannah. A recent study bySheisha et alin 2022 showed that during the period of construction the Kufu branch of the Nile extended right up to the Giza plateau, facilitating the transport of the stones needed for the construction of the pyramids. We do not need aliens when we have water.

84,National Geographic,History & Culture,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/pope-francis-vatican-life,"The pope’s schedule often included time for visiting prisons, hosting audiences in St. Peter’s Square and blessing newlywed couples.

Each morningPope Francisawoke before dawn in his modest accommodation atCasa Santa Marta, the Vatican guest­house. As day broke, Pope Francis prayed and meditated before delivering a homily at morning Mass.

By midday thepopehad undertaken any number of duties, preferring to manage his schedule personally. Phone calls to colleagues and friends, meetings, and other appointments preceded lunch, after which he took a siesta.

His afternoons were often spent visiting prisons and juvenile detention centers, consulting with ambassa­dors to the papacy, or making appointments. Once a week he received a soccer update from a member of the Swiss Guard, a necessity since the pope stopped watching television in 1990. Though Pope Francis may have given up television, he was an active lover of the arts. He enjoyed opera, classical music, and baroque artwork, and he identified Federico Fellini'sLa Stradaas his favorite film.

A few times a month, the pope led Papal Mass and hosted regular audiences in St. Peter’s Square orthe Basilica(and sometimes both on busy days), which allowed tens of thousands of people to be in the pope’s presence. Often these individuals were from all over the world and wept and cheered when they caught a glimpse of the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

His evening meal was again taken among his fellow residents at the Casa Santa Marta. True to form, he never dined alone. Once back in his austere domicile, Pope Francis ended his day as it began—quietly. Each night, the pontiff read before drifting off to sleep.

85,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-your-next-adventure-amsterdam,"Join National Geographic photographer Jonathan Irish on a journey through Amsterdam’s bustling streets, picturesque canals, and top eateries to capture the essence of this vibrant city’s most captivating sights.

To understandAmsterdam, you have to explore the things that make the city one of Europe’s most enchanting: Its canals, its bicycles―and its stunning views. National Geographic photographerJonathan Irishrecently visited Amsterdam to do exactly that, and, in turn, found inspiration in this capital city and cultural hub. “It has more bridges than Paris, more canals than Venice, and more bicycles than anywhere, really,” says Irish. “It’s amazing, and it all makes for really interesting photography.”

DiscoverAmsterdam, Netherlands, through Jonathan’s lens, and see why this city should be your next adventure.

The 165 canals and more than 1,200 bridges that crisscross the capital are behind its nickname, “Venice of the North.” But the city’s real name is also directly tied to them. Amsterdam, founded in the mid-13thcentury, refers to the damming of theAmstel River. Its waterways made it a major port city in the Netherlands, and its canals have been drawing attention ever since.

Among the must-sees is historicDamrak. Once one of Amsterdam’s busiest shipping ports, in the mid-19th century the canal was partially filled, creating an avenue that runs from Central Station to Dam Square. Though you’ll find plenty of 19th-century landmarks alongside restaurants and shops on this popular thoroughfare, it’s the 17th-century jewel-toned, canal-front houses harkening back to the city’s Golden Age that have proved popular with amateur and professional photographers alike. As for when to see it, Irish recommends early mornings and evenings for the best shots. “I find cities are really magical at 4:30 or 5 in the morning, when the light is just popping, and not a lot of people are out,” Irish says. “And then again after everyone’s gone to bed.”

Pro tip: At dusk, head to the corner of Keizersgracht and Leidsegracht streets where the canals meet to capture the homes and the bridges as they light up for the evening. Or venture down to Reguliersgracht street, where you can spot seven of the bridges in a row. Another popular vantage point takes in theZuiderkerk church(the country’s first Protestant church) at the end of the Groenburgwal Canal.

Another canal must-see:Bloemenmarkt, a unique floating flower market—and likely the only one of its kind in the world. Founded in 1862 and set in a series of barges lining the Singel Canal, florals and Dutch souvenirs of all kinds fill the space with color and fragrance.Order your favorite tulip bulbs online, and they’ll be shipped to your home at exactly the right time to plant them.

AtHans Egstorf, the oldest active bakery in Amsterdam, freshly baked sourdoughs and croissants have drawn people in since 1898. But it’s the made-from-scratch stroopwafels―the traditional flat cookies that are filled with caramel―that are the showstoppers. “It’s incredible. They make it right there in the window, and the smell is just wafting out the door,” recalls Irish. “You walk by and you’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, I have to stop!’ And that’s their whole plan!”

Even those with the willpower to resist the baked goods will appreciate the building’s architecture and facade. Renowned architect Gerrit van Arkel put a Dutch Art Nouveau (Nieuwe Kunst) spin on the building, which is evident in an eclectic style that includes an original tiled tableau, towering turrets, and asymmetrical balconies.

The food atNew Dutchin the charming neighborhood of Jordaan is tasty, but Irish also likes to refer to it as a “visual indulgence.” The owners have created a unique space where the menu items are showstoppers. To get a flavor of Amsterdam, don’t miss out on the New Dutch Experience platter, which offers a delightful array of bite-sized Dutch delicacies, such as ossenworst, green bean mash, and herring. And for diners who enjoy a show, the Rose Berry Bavarois—a mousse-like dessert served with liquid nitrogen—creates a fun, cloud-like finale to your meal.

Stopping for a paper cone of perfectly portable Belgian fries atVlaams Friteshuis Vleminckxis another must while in town. Pair the piping hot frites from the hole-in-the-wall location with an assortment of sauces ranging from satay sauce to curry ketchup.

Getting on a bike in Amsterdam is like riding the subway in New York.

It can feel intimidating on your own, though, given there are more bikes in the entire Netherlands than residents. Instead, joinMike’s Bike Tours―a local guide with a passion for the city will show you the sites, and keep you safe. Save time to visit theNEMO Science Museum rooftop. The spot is the highest city square in the Netherlands, and boasts an open-air exhibition, large terrace, and some of the best views of the city.

Walking the city is worthwhile, too. Head toThe 9 Straatjesfor a shopping fix. The historic buildings now offer trendy shops and cafes, and vintage lovers will enjoy the thrifting options and one-of-a kind finds waiting in quirky shops. From here it’s about a five-minute walk to theHouseboat Museum, where you can see firsthand what it’s like to live in one of the approximately 2,500 floating homes that pepper the Amsterdam canals.

And no visit to the city is complete without viewing it from the water. Irish’s cruise withCaptain Davewas memorable for the information offered, the unique boat (which sometimes secretly carried Netherlands royalty), and the lively host, Captain Dave himself. “He was a character. He’d been in Amsterdam all his life. He showed us where his houses were, where he grew up―we even saw his nephew along the way,” laughs Irish. “It’s fun to see the city from water level rather than street level. You get a different viewpoint, different photography, different light that comes through.”

One of the oldest botanical gardens in the world,Hortus Botanicuswas created as a medicinal herb garden in 1638. The plants are still here, but now the stunning Butterfly Greenhouse and the Palm Greenhouse―where you can get a tree-line view from an elevated walkway inside―are among its many draws. “Botanical gardens are always fun to explore,” says Irish of the three-acre city oasis. “I probably could have stayed there another hour taking photos.”

And, of course, you haven’t visited Amsterdam if you can’t say you stopped inMuseumplein(Museum Square). There, you can peek at masterpieces at theRijksmuseumandMocoMuseum. Or head a few miles north to theSTRAATMuseum, where street art is celebrated.

Whether you yearn to cruise the canals, hope to capture the perfect sunset skyscape, or just want to perfect your cycling skills with pit stops for windmills and even Belgian desserts,Amsterdamawaits. Irish suggests you do as he did: Make the most of this captivating city."
86,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/sandy-irvine-body-found-everest,"The discovery, made by a National Geographic team 100 years after the mountaineer vanished with George Mallory, could add new clues to one of the great unsolved adventure mysteries of all time.

When they spotted it, there was no mistaking what they were looking at: a boot melting out of the ice. As they drew closer, they could tell the cracked leather was old and worn, and the sole was studded and bracketed with the diamond-patterned steel hobnails of a bygone era of climbing.

In September, on the broad expanse of the Central Rongbuk Glacier, below the north face of Mount Everest, a National Geographic documentary team that included the photographer and director Jimmy Chin, along with filmmakers and climbers Erich Roepke and Mark Fisher, examined the boot more closely. Inside, they discovered a foot, remains that they instantly recognized as belonging to Andrew Comyn Irvine, or Sandy, as he was known, who vanished 100 years ago with the famed climber George Mallory.

“I lifted up the sock,” Chin says, describing the moment, “and there’s a red label that has A.C. IRVINE stitched into it.” Chin says he and his companions recognized the significance of the moment in unison. “We were all literally running in circles dropping F-bombs.”

Irvine and Mallory were last seen on June 8, 1924, while attempting to become the first people to reach the top of the world’s highest peak. The question of whether they had summited has endured asthe greatest climbing mystery of all time. If Irvine and Mallory succeeded, their feat would have come some 29 years before Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary finally reached the top of Everest.

Mallory’s remains were located in 1999, while the whereabouts of Irvine’s were unknown. “It's the first real evidence of where Sandy ended up,” says Chin of the discovery. “A lot of theories have been put out there.” He hopes the discovery helps explain what happened on the mountain in 1924, and brings some closure to Irvine’s relatives who revere him still. “When someone disappears and there’s no evidence of what happened to them, it can be really challenging for families. And just having some definitive information of where Sandy might’ve ended up is certainly [helpful], and also a big clue for the climbing community as to what happened.”

One of Chin’s first calls to share the news was to Irvine’s great-niece Julie Summers, 64, who wrote a2001 biography of Irvineand has championed his contributions to mountaineering for years. She was grateful for the news. “It’s an object that belonged to him and has a bit of him in it,” she says of the boot. “It tells the whole story about what probably happened.” Summers suspects that the remains were swept down the mountain by avalanches and crushed by the moving glacier. “I'm regarding it as something close to closure.” Members of the family have volunteered to share DNA samples to compare with the remains in order to confirm their identity.

(This team climbed Everest to search fora camera that could rewrite history)

Summers said the discovery brought back memories ofwhen news broke in 1999that Mallory’s body had been found by the alpinist Conrad Anker, as part of the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, which sought to settle the question of whether the pair had indeed reached the summit. An examination of his remains revealed the sort of deep rope marks that might indicate a fall that was caught by a rope wrapped around his waist—evidence that suggested to Anker that Mallory and Irvine were roped together in their final moments. “I knew at once that he’d been tied to his partner, and that he’d taken a long fall,” Anker wrote in The Lost Explorer, which he co-authored with David Roberts. Mallory’s right leg was badly broken and his uninjured left leg was laid delicately over the break, hinting that he didn’t die immediately in the fall. His dark snow goggles were in his pocket, which led to speculation that the fall could have occurred in the evening as the two had been descending. The photograph of his wife that Mallory had planned to leave on the summit wasn’t with him.

Finding Mallory’s remains answered several questions about the fate of the two men, but it left two big questions unanswered. Where was Irvine? And had the pair reached the summit? Climbers and historians long thought that answering the first question might offer clues about the second. After all, it had been Irvine who had carried the Kodak Vest Pocket Camera lent by expedition member Howard Somervell. The undeveloped film inside, it was thought, might contain the only conclusive evidence of their success. And so, the quest to find Irvine’s body acquired more interest—on par, in some circles, with the search for Amelia Earhart or Michael Rockefeller.

In September, several days before they came upon the boot, Chin says, the team was descending the Central Rongbuk Glacier when they found a different artifact that aroused their curiosity. “We discovered an oxygen bottle marked with a date on it that said 1933,” he says. Nine years after Mallory and Irvine had gone missing, the 1933 British Everest expedition was the fourth attempt to climb the mountain. It also ended in failure, but members of the 1933 expedition did find an ice ax that belonged to Sandy Irvine high on the northeast ridge, though well below where Mallory was found.

(Here's why Mount Everest keeps changing its height)

The discovery of the 1933 oxygen cylinder got Chin and his teammates thinking. “If Sandy had fallen down the north face, his remains or his body could be somewhere near here,” says Chin. They started to speculate that if an oxygen canister had fallen off the mountain, “it probably fell down quite a bit farther than a body—more like a missile.”

Chin suspected that Irvine’s remains could be close. “Sandy could potentially be a few hundred yards up the glacier from here toward the mountain,” he told Erich Roepke. In the days that followed, Chin and his team began taking a circuitous route across the folds and crevasses of the glacier. “It was actually Erich who spotted something and was like, ‘Hey, what's that?’,” says Chin. It was the boot, emerging from the ice. “I think it literally melted out a week before we found it.”

In her book about her great-uncle, Julie Summers describes Irvine as “a beautiful young man who died in the flush of youth.” Indeed, at 22 Irvine had been the youngest member of the 1924 expedition—a mission that followed two previous British climbs, one in 1921 to reconnoiter possible climbing routes, and a second in 1922 that marked the first serious attempt at summiting. In those days, simply reaching Everest required a month or more. The ropes were natural fiber, the outerwear consisted of wool and gaberdine, and the boots were leather—purchased for five pounds three shillings from James J. Carter, a London boot maker.

Irvine came from an upper middle-class family in Cheshire, England; he was handsome and athletic, a star rower at Oxford. Still, Irvine has often been the subject of criticism for lacking technical mountaineering experience prior to finding himself on the mountain in 1924. Reportedly, he likely suffered from a learning disability like dyslexia that hampered him as a reader, but he was mechanically gifted and excelled at math and engineering. When he joined the expedition, he was immediately appointed to serve as the oxygen officer, and he helped to improve the design of the team’s oxygen cylinders. He earned his spot on the summit team by dint of his will and athletic prowess. “Irvine,” wrote expedition leader E.F. Norton inThe Fight For Everest, “was big and powerful—with fine shoulders and comparatively light legs.”Summers says that Mallory likely valued Irvine’s deference to the older climber. Irvine was absolutely loyal to Mallory, she says.

Early on the morning of June 8, 1924, the two men set off for the summit under conditions that Mallory is said to have described as ''perfect weather for the job.''  That afternoon, they were last spotted by teammate Noel Odell, who reported briefly noticing two tiny figures near the Second Step during a brief parting of the clouds. Then they were gone.

(Inside the Everest expedition that built the world’s highest weather station)

Over the years, several theories have emerged to explain why Irvine was never found. One notion proposed by Mark Synnott, a writer, climber, and National Geographic contributor in his bookThe Third Pole: Mystery, Obsession, and Deathon Mount Everest suggests that Chinese climbers might have found the body and the camera long ago, and kept it quiet. Summers thinks the discovery of the boot refutes that idea. “I think Jimmy's find has absolutely answered that question,” she says.

An earlier theory suggests that a Chinese climber in 1975 had encountered a body outfitted in vintage clothing, just below the Northeast Ridge. That sighting became the basis for the target area of the 1999 Mallory Irvine Research Expedition. Members of that team, including Anker, expected that if they found a body it would be Irvine’s—which might then lead them to Mallory’s (the expedition’s leader Eric Simonson collected a DNA sample from one of Irvine’s relatives to aid in the identification). After Anker discovered Mallory’s remains— the team performed a burial on the mountain—he spoke with Summers. “Conrad Anker said to me, he was looking for the treasure map and ended up finding the treasure,” remembers Summers.

Several days after Chin and his team found the boot, they noticed ravens disturbing it. At that point, he says, he asked the China-Tibet Mountaineering Association (CTMA), the governmental authority that oversees the north side of Everest, whether the team could move the remains off the mountain. Chin carried the boot and foot off Everest in a cooler and turned it over to the CTMA. His team also took a DNA sample that they are working with the British Consulate on for further identification. “But I mean, dude,” says Chin. “There's a label on it.”

Chin is declining to elaborate on where exactly the remains were found—he says he wants to discourage trophy hunters. But he’s confident that more artifacts and maybe even the camera are nearby: “It certainly reduces the search area.”

87,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-explore-the-vast-wilderness-of-south-central-colorados-rugged-backcountry,"National Geographic Photographer Keith Ladzinski goes off-grid in the Centennial State to rediscover this unique region.

Soaring peaks, sprawling sand dunes, and small ranch towns define the region of south-central Colorado and the San Luis Valley—one of the world’s largest alpine valleys—making it a natural launchpad for outdoor adventures like off-roading, backpacking, rock climbing, and backcountry hiking. The valley's beauty and nature also make it an ideal location for photographers looking for an off-the-beaten-path experience.

Colorad-raised National Geographic PhotographerKeith Ladzinskiwas looking for just that. While his work documenting natural history and adventure sports takes him to the farthest reaches of the world, he loves getting back to his roots to uncover something new in unexpected places. For this assignment, he embarked on a trip from northern Colorado to the San Luis Valley to seek out rich culture, outdoor recreation, and the thrill of the open road.

In order to get out in the backcountry, travelers and photographers should be prepared to bring along all the tools needed, such as a GPS for when there is no cell service, camera equipment with a myriad of lenses, and the right vehicle—like theall-new 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser—which will not only take you on your off-road adventures but will also get you back.

The San Luis Valley encompasses 8,000 square miles spread across six counties bordered by jagged mountains. To the east are theSangre de Cristo Mountains, named in 1719 by a Spanish explorer. To the west are the San Juans, and to the north are the Saguache Mountains.These mountains surround one of the world’s largest high desert valleys at 8,100 feet. The San Luis Valley hosts nearly a dozen “Fourteeners” (14,000-foot mountain peaks) to climb, including Blanca Peak (14,350 feet), the fourth highest in the state, and Culebra Peak (14,047 feet), the highest in the Culebra Range, making it an ideal location for climbers and other adventure-seekers. The area also boasts numerous small-but-hardy towns, like Alamosa and Del Norte. These towns provide a snapshot of the region’s culture, as well as a window into its past.

One of the area’s most breathtaking sights is theGreat Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve, where the tallest dunes in North America showcase Sahara-like sands between alpine lakes, grasslands, wetlands, and forests. Visitors can hike and ""surf"" or sled down miles of dunes while carving out their own trails of the 30-square-mile active dunefield. Hidden Dune and Star Dune are tied for the tallest dunes in North America at 741 feet from base to peak. At night, the Milky Way and a plethora of constellations light up this certified International Dark Sky Park.

While the darkness is a draw for stargazers, the sunrises and sunsets in this region offer unique ambient lighting for photographers. At sunset, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains turn the iconic blood-red hue that gives them their name (“Blood of Christ”). But Ladzinski found beautiful lighting in less obvious places on his recent assignment.Trinchera Ranch, where Ladzinski spent several days, protects over 172,000 acres of protected landscape that includes not only extensive wildlife habitat, but opportunities for a range of outdoor activities. Thanks to the ranch’s conservation efforts, the pristine area features rivers, streams, aspen and conifer forests, and a myriad of hidden spots to photograph.

Some of Ladzinski's most memorable moments involved finding perfectly illuminated landscapes. One early morning, he hiked out around Trinchera Ranch to capture a waterfall with a long exposure because he liked its structure and clean cascades.

“As someone who loves to shoot landscapes, a scene like that is so inviting,” he said. “It was right as the sky started to take on a different color. That compositional opportunity allowed me to riff less, look more.”

Another photo that demanded to be captured: leafless cottonwood trees at twilight, as the sky transitioned from yellow to purple.Ladzinski spent 20 minutes walking beneath a cottonwood grove admiring the twisting structures of leaves and branches.

“I love photographing trees,"" he said. ""It was quite a special moment to me.”

Beyond the incredible landscapes beckoning adventure, there are also vast regions of preserved land for wildlife. The San Luis Valley National Wildlife Refuge Complex comprises the 12,000-acre Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge, the 15,000-acre Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuge, and the 93,000-acre Baca National Wildlife Refuge, each geographically diverse. Over 20,000 migrating sandhill cranes descend into the San Luis Valley from February to March yearly, then again from September through November. Sandhill cranes are just one of the hundreds of bird species enjoying the various wetlands, riparian corridors, grasslands, and rolling uplands of the San Luis Valley National Wildlife Refuge Complex and the Great Sand Dunes National Park, but thanks to their size and majestic manner, they’re a favorite sight among visitors.

Exploring these impressive landmarks requires a vehicle with grit and the ability to conquer rugged terrain. A vehicle like the all-new 2024 Toyota Land Cruiser is an ideal partner for exploration ahead.

There is no shortage of epic adventures and unique experiences in the San Luis Valley and south-central Colorado. From driving through juniper-wooded forests with alpine vibes and mountain views to exploring pastures and wetlands filled with wildlife, this region just might be the perfect place to reconnect with nature—and yourself.

88,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/best-value-for-money-italian-ski,"Reasonable prices coupled with sunshine and Alpine gastronomy make Italy a timeless winter favourite.

Of the key Alpine ski destinations, Italy offers the best value for money. Here, an espresso can cost €1.50 (£1.30) a shot, and a piste-side plate of pasta €10-15 (£9-13), items that are often 70-100% dearer in the A-list ski areas of France. And a peak-week, February half-term holiday in a three-star hotel can come in less than €1,745 (£1,500) per person half board, including flights and transfers. And that’s not taking some back-of-beyond resort as a point of comparison, either: all these prices are available in or around Canazei in Val di Fassa, part of the vast Dolomiti Superski area. On its doorstep, more than 300 miles of perfectly groomed pistes spin off the central Sella Ronda circuit; explore the area’s outer limits and that total hits 745 miles.

But it’s not the value that will spark your passion for the Italian Alps. It’s the look and taste of them, especially if you gravitate towards the Aosta Valley and the Dolomites, two of Italy’s most spectacular areas for both skiing and gastronomy. The former wriggles eastwards beneath the central Alpine Ridge, serving up some of Europe’s most hair-raising landscapes. The fearsome southern face of Monte Cervino (the Matterhorn’s Italian name) is one, so sheer and towering it seems certain to topple as you cower beneath it in Cervinia.

Over in the Dolomites, meanwhile, primordial coral reefs have been left high and dry by retreating oceans to become flat-topped, sheer-sided citadels of rock. You can’t, as a general rule, ski down them; the pistes unfurl across the pastures below. But they provide a mesmerising backdrop to the area and its gastronomic scene. Along with the rich larder of ingredients from the Alps, the Adriatic and the Po Valley, wines from this sunny, southeastern corner of the Alps are also exceptionally varied and surprisingly good: try a glass of twice-fermented Trentodoc Spumante fizz to get the gist. And this season, the region gets direct flights from Stansted, with Sky Alps into Bolzano.

Italy, though, tends to be sunnier and drier than France, Switzerland and Austria. Occasionally, runs of winter storms can provide dramatic exceptions to this rule. But for the most part, don’t come here for knee-deep snow. You will, however, get some of the world’s best snow-making systems, capable of covering hundreds of miles of pistes in good-quality powder.

In a couple of seasons’ time — February 2026 — the Winter Olympics are coming to Italy, with Cortina d’Ampezzo set to be one of the hosts. Once the world gets a taste of its Dolomite scenery and thrilling Olympia Delle Tofane downhill course, it’s bound to come running. So book now: those low-ish prices may not survive the charge.

1. Canazei

Best for: intermediate skiersSome of the Dolomiti Superski’s best intermediate pistes await above Canazei, on the wide Belvedere sector. Mid-season, before spring thaws take hold, it’s the perfect place to warm up your ski legs before spinning off round the Sella Ronda in search of pastures new. Below, the three-star Hotel Italia is five minutes’ walk from lifts, ski hire and nightlife. Seven nights in Canazei starts from £992 per person, half board, including flights from London and transfers.2. Cervinia

Best for:early- and late-season tripsNo wonder Cervinia’s season runs from October until May: its ski area, shared with the resort of Zermatt, rises to a snowsure 3,820m. Plan several cross-border trips: the new Glacier Ride II gondola, which links the area’s two top stations, has made the return journey from Switzerland quicker than ever. Book the Valtur Resort, with its own spa, to insure yourself against the occasional snowstorm. Seven nights in Cervinia starts from £1,128 per person, half board, including flights from London and transfers.

3. Alagna

Best for: heli-skiingHuddling beneath the Monte Rosa Massif, Alagna is served by only a handful of lifts, but ski enthusiasts love it all the same — not least for being home to some of the best heli-skiing in the Alps. Book a package from James Orr Heliski, which provides a local guide on top of two heli-drops; you’ll get plenty of guided skiing even if the weather keeps the choppers grounded. Heliski offers a four-night trip to Alagna from £2,250 per person, B&B, including transfers.

89,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/explorers-of-the-year-2025-bertie-gregory-pablo-garcia-borboroglu,"Pablo “Popi” García Borboroglu and Bertie Gregory have been named the 2025 Rolex National Geographic Explorers of the Year.

As a boy growing up in Argentina’s Buenos Aires Province,Pablo “Popi” García Borborogluwas enchanted by his grandmother’s tales of her youthful visits to the teeming penguin colonies of Argentine Patagonia. He was a 19-year-old tour guide when he first glimpsed one, and it dawned on him then how important it was to share with others his sense of awe, inspiring them to protect penguins and their habitats.

A hemisphere away,Bertie Gregorycame to a similar realization as a teenage wildlife photographer roaming the English countryside. Today, at 31, he’s an accomplished wildlife filmmaker and lead storyteller behind the upcoming National Geographic seriesSecrets of the Penguins—on which he worked with Borboroglu, now a marine biologist and founder and president of the Global Penguin Society. For their efforts, Borboroglu and Gregory have been named the 2025 Rolex National Geographic Explorers of the Year.

“Popi García Borboroglu and Bertie Gregory exemplify the power of collaboration in exploration,” says National Geographic Society CEO Jill Tiefenthaler. “By uniting groundbreaking conservation science with masterful storytelling, they not only deepen our understanding of penguins but galvanize global action to protect them.”

Borboroglu’s initiativesto create protected areas for penguins have helped conserve some 32 million acres of habitat, on land and at sea. Now 55, he takes inspiration from the birds’ resilience—the way they swim hundreds or thousands of miles for food, avoid predators and pollution, and survive in environments increasingly impacted by climate change. “When you see penguins making that big effort,” he reflects, “you say, How can I give up?”

Being recognized as an Explorer of the Year alongside his filmmaker friend, Borboroglu says, is “fantastic … a great combination of different kinds of explorers and expertise.”

At first, Gregory says, he was hesitant to make a documentary about penguins. The Emmy-winning host of the Disney+ seriesAnimals Up Close, who has shot for iconic series likePlanet EarthandFrozen Planet, knew that filming in penguins’ harsh habitats would be tough—and worried the species was already plenty documented. “If you’re going to make a series calledSecrets of the Penguins,” he says, “you’ve got to show people something they’ve never seen before.”

(Bertie Gregory’s filmmaking offers a front-row ticket to wildlife in action.)

But Gregory embraced the challenge. To film one of the series’ three episodes, he camped for more than two months near anemperor penguincolony in Antarctica’s Atka Bay. He was documenting a critical phase in a penguin’s life cycle, when juveniles, abandoned by their parents, are left to figure out how to become a “proper adult penguin,” getting themselves to the ocean to swim and hunt.

Gregory succeeded spectacularly in capturing behaviors never before filmed, including footage of hundreds of young emperor penguins entering the sea by “BASE jumping” off a 50-foot cliff. “I really think it’s going to blow people’s minds,” he says. “I thought I knew what penguins’ limits were. I was wrong.”

90,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-14-best-cultural-experiences-kansai,"Wander the pathways of holy pilgrimages, learn from ancient art forms and savour traditional cuisine in the region of Kansai, Japan’s cultural heartland.

Modern Japan wouldn’t be what it is today without the influence and input of the region of Kansai — and its cities Osaka and Kyoto — which have significantly influenced the country’s political, cultural and economic development. Kyoto served as Japan’s capital for over a millennium and is today known as the nation’s cultural epicentre, attracting millions of travellers to the city’s streets each year.

Beyond Kyoto, visitors will see there is a profound respect for tradition throughout the region found in the theatre, religion, art and cuisine. From classical masked Noh performances to ancient Shinto shrines believed to be the home of local kami (spirits or deities) to traditionalkaisekibanquets — there are myriad experiences and the region reveals new depths with every visit.

1. Mie PrefectureDine with ama divers

Stretching along the rural southeastern coast of Kansai, Mie Prefecture is perfect for an extended trip by road or rail. Most intriguing, however, are theamadivers of the region. Meaning ‘women of the sea’,amawere once common across Japan, but as of 2023, Mie boasts the largest number of activeamatoday, with an impressive 514 located here out of a national total of 1,220.

Theamawomen free-dive to the sea floor using just their bodies and simple tools to source seafood including precious abalone (a unique marine snail). To protect the ocean’s resources, the divers are careful, ensuring they only catch what they need. Visitors are able to dine with the divers atSatoumian’samahut experience. Here, groups gather in a replica of an originalamahut and listen to tales from the divers.

2. Osaka PrefectureExplore ancient temples

The Katsuoji temple lies only 15 miles from the mega-city of Osaka — but in another sense, it’s a universe away. The magnificent grounds are surrounded by serene forests and offer impressive views for each of the four seasons. Since 727 CE, Katsuoji has been associated with its ‘victor’s luck’, after a sick emperor is said to have prayed here and seen his health miraculously restored. The emperor went on to name the temple ‘Katsuoji’, with the initial meaning of ‘victorious king temple’.

Today, the tradition continues, evident in its resident population ofdarumadolls — small red figures of various sizes that act as wish-fulfilling lucky charms. Visitors travelling to the temple write on the bottom of thedarumadolls what victory they would like in their own lives and pray for them.

3. Kyoto CityTaste traditional cuisine

Kyoto was the capital of Japan for a thousand years, and it remains the capital of traditional Japanese gastronomy. Many chefs still look to the city’s rich culinary past for inspiration with their cooking today. To savour the city’s distinctive cuisine, head toManshige Kyoto-style Cuisine— a traditional restaurant with beautifully designed rooms with tatami floors. The restaurant has been operating since 1937 and is now guided by a third-generation master chef. Here, visitors can dine on the signature simmered sea bream — once beloved by successful businessmen of the textile industry — or embark on akaisekibanquet, in which an array of small and intricate dishes are shuttled to your table.

4. Nara PrefectureHike through highlands

Poised midway between the modern metropolises of Osaka and Nagoya sits Soni, one of Japan’s most beautiful rural villages. This picturesque pitstop is home to scenic mountain trails and renowned pampas grass, used in ages past to thatch nearby rooftops. This region is the birthplace ofurushi, a natural lacquer integral to Japanese crafts — a tradition that traces back to the Heian period (795-1185).

Visitors can explore the expansive Soni Highland, home to a sweeping plateau covering 99 acres towards the base of Mt. Kuroso. Expert guides offer tours, sharing tales of local folklore and insights into conservation efforts. Later, visitors can relax atOkame-no-yu, a highland onsen (hot spring), for a rejuvenating retreat.

5. Wakayama PrefectureTaste fresh bluefin tuna

An essential component in many sushi and sashimi dishes, bluefin tuna can be as precious as gold in Japan — a single fish sold for £2.36 million in 2019. To see these tuna as they swim, head to Kushimoto, a town at the farthest end of the Kii Peninsula, with its harbour strung along a natural isthmus. Notably, this town was the first place in the world where Pacific bluefin tuna were successfully fully farmed.

Visitors can feed the bluefin tuna here, weighing between 10kg and 40kg each. Afterwards, travellers can head south to the Shionomisaki Lighthouse, located on Cape Shionomisaki — its blinking light stands sentinel at the southernmost point of Japan’s main island, Honshu.

6. Kyoto PrefectureLearn about age-old crafts

Nothing to do with the Argentine dance of the same name, the Tango Peninsula is a thumb of land jutting out into the sea, crowned by emerald hills and edged by sandy coves. It’s well known for TangoChirimen, an elegant silk crêpe that has been woven here for around three centuries, with the drumming of looms a rare disturbance to the serenity of this rustic nook.

The silk weaves its way to all corners of Japan, with some 70% of the fabric used for all kimonos coming from Tango. The material is highly prized for its finely textured surface and its dye-ability. In the town of Kyotango, visitors can tour the Tayuh factory, which has been in business for almost a century. Here, the diligent work of master craftspeople can be witnessed.

7. Shiga PrefectureKayak to a Torii gate

Lake Biwa is Japan’s largest lake — and a worthy place for visitors to immerse themselves in the country’s spiritual life. Watching over this shimmering body of water is the holy peak of Mount Hiei, measuring 848m. Mount Hiei is known as the ‘mother mountain of Japanese Buddhism’ as many high-ranking monks have trained here.

Monks still visit Mount Hiei to take part in a gruelling 1,000-day pilgrimage where they repeatedly walk around the same route, known askaihogyo(circling the mountain). Perhaps most peaceful of all is Shirahige Shrine on Lake Biwa’s western shore. Here, visitors can kayak up to a vermilion-coloured Torii gate — a structure symbolising a threshold between the material and divine worlds.

8. Tokushima PrefectureJoin a historic pilgrimage

The Shikoku Pilgrimage measures some 745 miles, passes by 88 temples, takes roughly six weeks or more to complete and welcomes 100,000 participants annually. At the same time, it has a magic that cannot be expressed in numbers. Outsiders can join this legendary circular pilgrimage route that traces the coast of the island of Shikoku, passing a rich mosaic of landscapes, from noisy cities to serene forests.

The route follows in the footsteps of Kobo Daishi, the 8th-century monk who spent time here. The defining sight of Shikoku is that of thehenro— pilgrims adorned in the traditional attire, featuring a straw hat, white garments symbolising purity, and akongozuestaff to use as a walking stick representing the companionship of Kobo Daishi.

9. Fukui PrefectureSail to Sotomo Arch

Fairly few outsiders visit Fukui Prefecture — yet those who do discover a coastline of hidden bays and sublime rock formations. None are more spectacular than the Sotomo Arch. Here, aeons of wave action have hewn a natural bridge out of granite cliffs — just wide enough for a small boat to pass beneath.

After a local seafood lunch at Kaikoen restaurant in Obama City, travellers can book onto a boat tour departing from the nearby Wakasa Fisherman’s Wharf. They’ll spend an hour tracking the steep shores of the Uchitomi Peninsula and learning about the history of the area before reaching the rocks, battered by the swells from the Sea of Japan. The arch is part of a beautiful four-mile stretch made up of rugged cliffs and dramatic cave entrances.

10. Osaka CityEnjoy a classical show

Noh is Japan’s traditional masked theatre performance, an art form that has captivated audiences in Kansai since the Middle Ages. The show focuses on actors adorned in elaborate costumes, with their mesmerising movements accompanied by the music of four instruments (a flute, a taiko and a small and large tsuzumi).

It’s said to be the oldest surviving form of stage performance in the world.Ohtsuki Noh Theatreis one of the few of its kind in the Kansai region to have escaped the destruction of the Second World War. Inside, you’ll find an all-cypress wooden stage, fringed by a perimeter of white pebbles. The theatre holds regular productions and there are beginner’s workshops for those wishing to be initiated into this ancient art form.

11. Hyogo PrefectureTour Tamba beanfields

A ring of mountains guard the fertile basin of Tamba-Sasayama, where patchwork fields straddle the banks of a rushing river. This area is the heartland of the Tamba ‘black soybean’ cultivation — a variety of beans prized for their delicate taste, which become particularly prominent around New Year when it symbolises good health.

To see these legendary beanfields up close, visitors can take a guided tour to learn about the growing, harvesting and shipping process. There is also the option to explore Tamba’s many quaint villages, visit local communities and hike in the nearby countryside. During the December harvest season, travellers will see roads alive with bean fans keen to secure some of the crop.

12. Kobe CitySample famous sake

Among gourmands, ‘Kobe’ is synonymous with Japan’s best beef. However, this likeable city is also known for its excellent sake. The Nada district possesses all the requisite ingredients for producing the cherished rice wine: calcium- and potassium-rich spring water, an abundance of rice paddies, and a helpful proximity to Kobe port, allowing colourful sake barrels to be exported far and wide.

A great way to learn about sake is on a guided tour of the Nada district which stretches for almost two miles from east to west. Visitors will be taken along riverside promenades, stopping by storied sake breweries to taste different labels. Some also have museums to provide more information about the history of the sake they produce.

13. Sakai CityStudy an ancient art

Shakyorefers to the art of hand-copying the sutras — a practice that thrived during the 8th century as Buddhism began to take root in Japan. Typically, the activity was undertaken by people as an expression of piety. Fast forward to the 21st century, and some temples now offershakyoclasses for visitors. Students are given the opportunity to experience a sense of mindfulness as they trace the contours of Japanese letters and develop intense focus while guiding the ink.

One of the best places to try shakyo is Myohoji, a temple in the port town of Sakai City, on the southern side of Osaka Bay. In this peaceful sanctuary, students can put calligraphy brush to paper — and, in more ways than one, turn over a new leaf.

14. Tottori PrefectureVisit historic harbours

Tottori is the least populous of Japan’s 47 prefectures, though what it lacks in headcount, it makes up for in scenery. It’s home to the 1,729m mass of Daisen, a mountain that rises from the shore, serving as a talisman for fishermen navigating the lonely leagues of the surrounding sea.

Daisen can be seen from Sakaiminato, a historic port city set on a sandbar at the northwestern end of Tottori Prefecture. Sakaiminato stands as the epicentre of the fishing industry in western Japan, boasting one of the largest catches of tuna and red snow crab in Japan, as well as horse mackerel. Explore its quays as part of an organised tour, observing the freshly caught fish that are being processed, as well as the wholesale market where they are sold."
91,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-the-mystic-side-of-maine-is-found-in-fairies-desert-sands-and-unexpected-boat-tour,"Take a surprising journey with National Geographic Photographer Michael George to the lesser-known corners of Casco Bay.

On my way toMackworth Island, a soft mist settles on the causeway, obscuring my destination from view. This mysterious veil makes sense for an island with a whimsical reputation. Slowly, the trees and coastline appear, and I greet the park ranger at the entry booth. We talk through the highlights: “If you turn right, you’ll reach the fairy houses.” Mackworth has a 1.25-mile perimeter walking trail, and in one small part of the forest, you’ll find dozens of small art projects utilizing the natural resources from the park. Children and families combine twigs, leaves, pieces of shells, and stones to make small homes for the woodland fairies who may or may not visit the island. There’s also a pet cemetery, and I tell the ranger I’ve heard a rumor it’s the one that inspired famous Mainer Stephen King’s novelPet Sematary. The ranger is cryptic in his response, and sends me on my way.

I pass runners, dog walkers, and families on the path. A few children are working on a new fairy house, and its main construction material is pine cones. On one of the trees, a smiley face has been crafted with lichen. There are small hints of creativity everywhere you turn. Maine, known for its kind people and fresh seafood, has a small-town spirit that comes alive in quirky and unexpected corners. Mackworth is only my first stop exploring this side ofMainethrough the veil. Finishing the loop, I pass the ranger station once more. He flags me down with a shout, waving his phone in the air. A diligent researcher, he shares that Stephen King’s inspiration came from a pet cemetery located two hours north and near Bangor. I appreciate him taking the time to report the facts, but I hold onto the myth of the fairies.

Moving from urban legends to local folktales, I head three miles west of Freeport to theDesert of Maine. This geological anomaly dates back to the last ice age. As glaciers retreated, they left behind a deposit of sand-like glacial silt. Unfortunately for William Tuttle, who bought the land in 1797, this is where he decided to start a farm. Overgrazing can destroy land, but this example is a bit extreme: As he let the sheep enjoy themselves, they slowly unearthed not just a few hills of poor soil, but literal sand dunes. Since 1925, the site has operated as a tourist destination, undergoing a massive revitalization in the past few years. The new design falls somewhere between a classic TV game show and a nostalgic roadside attraction. Throughout the 20 acres of rolling sand, families can embark on a scavenger hunt, ride an electric train-themed trolly, or glamp along the river in a variety of structures, including A-frames, full cabins, and picture-worthy tents.

On this day, Maine is experiencing an early summer heatwave, so my experience of the desert feels extra authentic. Sun beating from above and reflecting off the sand below, I am convinced I’ve landed somewhere deep in the Southwest. That is, until I spot Barb and Laurie, two locals sporting visors and sunglasses and making their way through an adventure mini-golf course. “This place has been around since I was little, but it’s really changed. The new owners—you can tell they care.” The 18-hole course is remarkable, with water features and sculptures that tell the story of the desert’s history. A coy sheep sculpture sports a cheeky sign around its neck that says, “This desert is our fault.” As I watch Barb hit a leopard-print ball across hole 13, I thank the sheep for unearthing this hidden gem.

Mainers are proud to share their history, and some might even sell you a piece of it. Nick and Amanda Kent are the owners ofMaine Wicked Goods, an antique shop that can only be described as delightful, cozy chaos. There’s so much to see from floor to ceiling that I need to walk through the store five times before my eyes allow me to process it. Their newest addition, six-week-old Finneas, is unfortunately not for sale. He runs through the space like a bull (puppy) in a china shop (antique store). My grandma owned an antique store for decades, so I feel at home amid the delightful assortment of treasures waiting to be found. I ask Amanda how they decide what to keep for themselves versus what to sell. She alludes to what things may look like at home: “I tell my friends, it’s not hoarding―it’s inventory.” With the Kents’ welcoming personalities, the enthusiasm of Finneas playing with a water bottle, and approximately 9,000 items I have yet to discover, I regret I can’t spend my entire week searching for the perfect wicked good.

Though Icanspend my afternoon having some wicked fun.Old Orchard Beachcan’t escape comparison to my favorite place back home: Coney Island. This seaside resort town has many attractions, including Palace Playland, a beachfront amusement park with rollercoasters, a Ferris wheel, and arcade games aplenty. The pier is unlike any I’ve seen before—a full strip of shops and restaurants suspended above the ocean. There are many places I go to escape crowds, but a lively beach feels like a party. There are sunbathers and families playfully dodging the waves. Older couples reading in beach chairs, and friends playing paddle ball. Orchard Beach is the first place I’ve been in Maine that can only be described as “a vibe.” The sandy beach spans seven miles, and as I squeeze the sand with my toes, I look out into the water, curious how I might go a little deeper.

The answer is not one I could have ever guessed: hitch a ride on a mailboat. TheCasco Bay Mail Runis a unique way to travel between theCasco Bayislands, including Little and Great Diamond, Long, Cliff, and Chebeague. While I could easily mistake this as a scenic cruise, I am onboard a working vessel. Only now this boat is delivering people’s packages, letters, bills, and me. The full tour can last upwards of three hours, but I am only taking a short journey to Great Diamond Island for dinner and drinks atCrown Jewel.This tropical-styled bistro with a neon flamingo on the wall is a vibrant surprise. Their menu is small, and walking by the open-window kitchen I see why. Each dish is a mini artwork using locally sourced ingredients. I indulge in the mussels and fluke crudo, followed by a cocktail called ""famous on the weekend."" It’s only Tuesday, but after being hand-delivered to an unbridged island for a lavish meal, I’m feeling like an ""it boy.""

All illusions of grandeur must come to an end, and I call a water taxi to bring me back to reality. If you don’t want to stick with the ferry schedule, the water taxis are like the Uber of the sea, and will quickly bring you to wherever you need to go. The sun is setting, and I am eager to catch the last light at a lesser-known lighthouse.Spring Point Ledgeis very close to downtown Portland, and is known as a “sparkplug” lighthouse, a cast iron lighthouse built upon a rock formation offshore. Getting out to this lighthouse is an adventure in itself. It sits at the end of a 950-foot rock breakwater, many of which have large gaps that require jumps to make the crossing. When I arrive, the wind whips across the bay, making the golden-hour scene even more dramatic. I can’t say exactly what it is, but lighthouses always fuel my imagination. It might be the countless poetic stories from literature, or the romantic idea of a lonely figure living by the sea. Whatever it is, this last evening on the bay has a touch of magic. I’m not sure who I have to thank: the people of Maine, or maybe it’s the fairies."
92,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-seeking-the-tastes-of-maine-from-sea-to-scone,"National Geographic Photographer Michael George discovers Maine has more to please your palate than fresh seafood.

People usually travel toMaineguided by a sense of adventure. I arrive guided by my stomach, eager to eat and drink my way through theCasco Bayregion’s food scene. To see Mainers' commitment to harvesting and preparing impeccable cuisine, I stop byThe Lobster Shack at Two Lights,where they’ve been serving seafood plates for over a hundred years.

Waiting in line, I overhear the man in front of me ask, “Does your lobster roll come with butter or mayo?” He has a sharp undertone as if there is only one correct answer. “Mayo,” the cashier responds―and the man orders his lobster roll plain. I believe I’ve just witnessed the settling of one of the great food debates of our time. Though I love mayonnaise to an unhealthy degree, I am new here, and that customer is only a few feet away from me. I order mine plain as well, ensuring my first taste of Maine lobster remains pure. It wasn’t a wrong decision. The flavor is like the air along the coast: fresh, crisp. It makes the colors more saturated and the light brighter. I’ve been in Maine for three days already, but with this bite, I’ve finally arrived.

The Lobster Shack is perched above the rocks on the coast, and the view from the outdoor tables features a lighthouse poking above the trees and a sun setting slower than I thought it could. In late June, the days are so long that it feels like an endless summer. Now that I’ve had my first lobster roll, I am curious to see the process from the start, which means getting on the water at 5 a.m. the following morning for first light. When I arrive on the docks atHarraseeket Lunch and Lobster,I meet Tommy Coffin, a third-generation lobster fisherman and son of the current owner. He loads a barrel of bait at the marina that sits directly behind the restaurant.

Visitors can watch boats come and go throughout the day, underlining how quickly their menu items move from the bay to the kitchen. Harraseeket exudes old-school charm with a colorful menu and construction that has been Frankenstein-ed together over the years to accommodate their success. Our trip on Tommy’s boat takes less than half an hour to arrive at the first buoy. Tommy and his team’s routine efficiency is apparent as they measure, band, and toss the lobster into an onboard tank.

Returning to the dock, the morning’s haul is unloaded into one of the more fascinating features of the restaurant—a tank room with a pump that moves thousands of gallons of seawater every hour, ensuring the lobster never leave their natural environment. Tommy, standing on the deck alongside his brother, tells me he’s been on the water as long as he can remember, his family part of Maine’s historical connection to the surrounding waterways. To learn more about this history and the other families in the region, I travel a short drive northeast to theMaine Maritime Museumin Bath.

Housed in the original buildings of the Percy&Small Shipyard, I walk into a vaulted room and learn lobster trap buoys are like family crests. Each fisherman has a specified design to represent them, and a floor-to-ceiling map showcases where they operate. Standing in front of this colorful installation, I began to understand how long locals have been committed to harvesting fresh food from the sea. The museum is part of a 20-acre campus where each building introduces visitors to a different aspect of ship-building history. In addition to this two-story structure dedicated to lobstering, there is a Victorian house that offers insights into the daily life of a shipbuilding family and a Watercraft Restoration Center where volunteers help staff to repair, restore, preserve, and even build boats.

These volunteers are the heart of the operation. Jeff Tarbox, who used to work at Bath Iron Works down the road, is a walking encyclopedia of ship facts. He excitedly describes how theKennebec River, which runs alongside the museum, used to sell and ship their ice because it was so clear you could read a newspaper through it. At its shipbuilding peak, there were 40 shipyards along this small stretch of riverbank. Driving through Bath, I see a sign that proudly proclaims, “Through these gates pass the best shipbuilders in the world.” This declaration has been true for centuries, and shipbuilding in the area dating back to the 1740s. Just thinking about all of that manual labor, I’m hungry again.

While ocean-to-table is the most obvious example of fresh, there are many other culinary corners where that level of commitment to craft is evident. InScarborough, Maine, I drive up toLen Libby Candies, a rare candy store where everything is still handmade. Walking in, I feel my blood sugar rise just from the smell. Delightfully sweet, the air is like a 4D experience of Hansel and Gretel. I look past the endless variety of taffy, brittles, chocolate, and cookies to lock eyes with the real star of the show:Lenny, a life-sized chocolate moose. Lenny, weighing 1,700 pounds, has stood proudly (and somehow uneaten!) for over 25 years. While he is the most well-known attraction, I am delighted to report there are also two dark chocolate bear cubs that kind of steal the show. There’s a whole corner dedicated to blueberries infused with honey, teas, chocolates, and even caramel popcorn.

Maine is the top producer of wild blueberries in the U.S. and the berry creativity doesn’t stop here. Berries can be found in countless baked goods throughout the city of Portland. Bakeries in the area are no joke, receiving James Beard nominations and awards left and right.Standard Baking Co., one of these stars, is inconspicuous and housed in an industrial brick building at the end of a parking lot. You know they’re serving something special when patrons have no problem lining up across hot pavement. Joining the queue, I order a blueberry scone after quickly reaching the friendly cashier. I am curious to know how they infuse the flavor into a classic baked good. The answer: remarkably. The scone has almost a perfume of blueberry before it gives way to a rich and buttery flavor, ending with a satisfying sweetness. I’ve never had a baked good with tasting notes.

All pastry must be followed by coffee; I don’t make the rules. Luckily, I am not far fromBurundi Star Coffee. Walking in, I am intentionally transported to the owner Jocelyne Kamikazi’s home country. Jocelyne grew up as the daughter of a coffee farmer in Burundi. After immigrating to the country with her family, she opened this café to support the coffee farmers in Burundi, and Burundi Star Coffee is directly sourced from that country.

Jocelyne’s intention with her café is to also return that hospitality. In addition to serving high-quality coffee and a small food menu, she opens the space to community organizations like the Alliance Française du Maine, whose members gather to practice their French. When I ask to take her portrait, a few regular customers begin playfully heckling her from behind the camera. Her warm smile spreads throughout the room as she jokes that they better stop or they won’t be allowed back. In that brief moment, the cafe is as playful and relaxed as a good friend’s living room.

Letting the brew buzz through my brain, I look to the wall where there is a carved wooden map of Burundi. Studying the outline, I think of and am grateful for the farmers who handpicked this coffee fruit. The eastern side of the country is jagged, similar to the coast of Maine. My mind drifts then to the lobstermen and women who are up every morning to harvest from the sea. . . the bakers and chocolate makers, and all the people who work with care to provide a moment of wonder through the most indulgent sense of all: taste. My last happy thought before I get up to leave is of the lobster roll I ordered at Harraseeket Lunch&Lobster. It was completely slathered in mayo, and, no, I will not write in print which one I prefer.

93,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-6-of-the-best-seafood-restaurants-in-cape-cod-and-the-islands,"Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are renowned for their excellent seafood. Whether you’re after a buttery lobster roll or a steaming bowl of clam chowder, here's the best restaurants serving up these much-loved classics.

Salt air, a summer breeze and the sound of the Atlantic Ocean crashing onto a rocky shore. Summer on the coast of New England is an entire world unto itself, and the scene is incomplete without tucking into a creamy soft-shell crab sandwich. Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket are all renowned for their seafood restaurants, and the choices are varied and abundant — from high-end dining in historic New England cottages to dockside picnic tables overlooking the sea. Whether visitors choose to dine at traditional lobster shacks or modern oyster bars — it’s a guarantee that they will eat exceptionally well.

1.The HomeportMartha’s Vineyard

This Chilmark-area oyster bar first opened its doors in 1930 and has been serving the freshest and most delectable steamers (softshell clams), steamed mussels and stuffed quahog clams (a New England speciality) in the decades since. From the ‘raw bar’ menu guests can order The Jaws platter to share; the film was famously shot on the island. Set in the 300-year-old fishing village of Menemsha,The Homeportis known for its stunning sunsets, smoked bluefish pate and ‘lobster in the semi-rough’ — served on the waterside patio or beside a roaring fire in the indoor dining room. Guests are encouraged to ‘leave the shells but take the memories’.

2.The Sweet LifeMartha’s Vineyard

Experience a taste of the sweet life in the scenic town of Oak Bluffs, famous for its colourful Victorian architecture, historic lighthouses and 19th-century gingerbread cottages.The Sweet Lifeis a favourite among visitors and residents alike. The restaurant works closely with island fishermen, and the food and drink menus frequently change to reflect what’s seasonal and available. The seafood pasta remains an evergreen classic, however, and every Wednesday is pasta night — the squid ink tagliatelle with local littleneck clams is a must-try, as is the octopus gnocchi.

3.Lobster PotCape Cod

In Cape Cod, the ocean plays an essential part in daily proceedings — both from a culinary and a leisure perspective. A day of clamming and sailing is best capped off with a Dark ’n’ Stormy cocktail and a dinner of freshly caught lobster.Lobster Potis a beloved institution in the vibrant city of Provincetown, its neon sign having beckoned generations of visitors to its waterfront dining room since 1979. Peppered shrimp and sautéed squid are local favourites, but the main event is, of course, the lobster, which is served pan-roasted, baked, stuffed or boiled.

4.Fishermen’s ViewCape Cod

There are few days as perfect as a New England summer, and there are even fewer meals as delectable as piping hot New England clam chowder. Even on a hot August afternoon, there’s always a chill in the air along the Massachusetts coast, and ‘chowda’ (as the locals call it) hits just the spot. The house clam chowder atFishermen’s View, in the bayside town of Sandwich, is among the best on the Cape. The restaurant’s sea-to-table ethos extends beyond just the servings on your plate, as you will catch glimpses of boaters and sailors as they navigate the busy canal and surrounding marina — a fisherman’s view, indeed.

5.Brotherhood of ThievesNantucket

Nantucket is an intoxicating blend of quaint New England charm set against a lively social backdrop — visitors arrive on the island as much for the scene as for the sea. Set on Broad Street in historic downtown Nantucket,Brotherhood of Thievesresembles an 1800s whaling tavern with a bustling bar and cosy, brick-lined interior. Enjoy the salty delights of the Atlantic with an inventive, modern twist — from lobster mac and cheese to tuna tostada and Nantucket sushi rolls (spicy scallops with tempura crunch). In the evening, the outdoor bar becomes a hub for island nightlife and post-dinner cocktails.

6.The Nantucket Lobster TrapNantucket

To toast or not to toast? On Nantucket, that is the question— regarding your lobster roll, of course.The Nantucket Lobster Traphas sidestepped this eternal debate by offering both options. Luckily, whichever way you order it, in the parlance of locals, it’s sure to be ‘wicked good’. The laid-back seafood shack also serves additional New England summer classics, including haddock, Nantucket Bay scallops and steamed mussels. The best part? There’s a takeout window for visitors to pick up their seafood to enjoy back at home or on a nearby beach. In this instance, the world truly is your oyster."
94,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/sandy-irvine-everest-mystery-what-it-means,"Here's why the lost explorer’s remains were hunted for so long—and what finding them now could mean.

Last week’sannouncementthat a boot and partial remains believed to belong to the British explorer Sandy Irvine had been found on Mount Everest by a National Geographic documentary crew supercharged interest in a mystery that has endured since he vanished with George Mallory on the mountain 100 years ago. “It’s the biggest thing that’s happened in mountaineering circles since Mallory’s body was found in 1999,” says Julie Summers, the great niece and biographer of Irvine. Summers says she was brought to tears when she was reached by phone with news of the discovery by Jimmy Chin, the National Geographic director, photographer, and climber who was leading the expedition.

Since June 1924, when the two men vanished into Everest’s swirling clouds while attempting to become the first people to summit the mountain, the tantalizing question has endured: Did they make it to the top before they perished? Now, suddenly, with the apparent emergence of Irvine’s boot historians, authors, and climbers who’ve dedicated a considerable part of their lives to unraveling the mystery are trying to understand what the discovery might actually mean.

“It certainly is a cornerstone in the whole story of Mallory and Irvine,” says Jochen Hemmleb, one of the researchers who’s been searching for Irvine for more than a quarter century and who was on the 1999 team that discovered the body of George Mallory. “One of my first reactions was this great sense of deja vu when I saw the pictures of the boot and the name tag. It was the same for me 25 years ago when the search team, Conrad [Anker] and the others, recovered the boot of Mallory.”

The hunt for Mallory and Irvine commenced as soon as they were recognized as lost. But expedition member Noel Odell, who conducted the initial search, soon recognized the search was futile, he later wrote. “After struggling on for nearly a couple of hours looking in vain for some indication or clue, I realised that the chances of finding the missing ones were indeed small on such a vast expanse of crags and broken slabs.”

Nine years later, in 1933, the first evidence of their presence on the mountain emerged when British climbers found an ice ax that had belonged to Irvine above 8,000 meters. In the years that followed, eyewitness accounts, mostly from Chinese climbers, began to accumulate suggesting a body or maybe two bodies were lying on the mountain, somewhere above 8,000 meters.

At least four stories that described the body of “an old English dead” were documented between 1960 and 1995. These accounts tended to make their way to English-speaking climbing circles without a lot of clarity; often they were shared non-chronologically and marred by language difficulty that made it hard to know who the witness might have glimpsed on the mountain. “Conflation, I think, is the right word there,” says author, climber, and National Geographic contributor Mark Synnott explaining the confusion that surrounds these stories.

On the basis of these circumstantial reports, two amateur researchers plotted out a target area for the 1999 expedition that ultimately located Mallory’s body. Those researchers were Hemmleb and Tom Holzel, who wroteThe Mystery of Mallory and Irvine,the book that had turned Hemmleb into a Mallory and Irvine sleuth. “I closed the book and this feeling washed over me,” Hemmleb recalls. “Hell, this story is going to lead to something in my life.”

Hemmleb joined the expedition and when the search team came across a body, they thought they’d found Irvine—right up until the moment when a name tag revealed they’d found the body of George Mallory.

While Mallory was the more famous of the two climbers, searchers have always been uniquely interested in finding Irvine’s body because of what it might reveal about the lost men’s fate. It has long been thought that Irvine was carrying a Kodak Vest Pocket camera—an artifact that might contain the undeveloped photos taken at the summit.

In the wake of the Mallory discovery, experts traded theories of Irvine’s whereabouts. Maybe his body was high on Everest for a time but was scraped off the mountain by an avalanche. Maybe it was moved. A particularly provocative idea was included in a 2022 postscript to Synnott’s book The Third Pole. Synnott shared a theory relayed by an unnamed British diplomat, that the Chinese—who claimed the first ascent of Everest’s north side in 1960—had found a body in 1975 and quietly removed the prized Kodak Vest Pocket camera and then buried the remains under some stones in order to protect the primacy of their first ascent. “I wish I could say who the source was because instantly everybody would be like, Oh wow, yeah,” says Synnott.

For her part, Julie Summers, the Irvine biographer, never accepted the idea that her great uncle was found, separated from the camera, and then buried. “I felt it was a desperate attempt to explain why this body could never be found.” says Summers.

Hemmleb, who has followed these theories closely and wrote his own book, Ghosts on Everest, thinks last week’s discovery doesn’t rule out many of the prevailing hunches about what could have happened. “I personally feel that, given the nature of the discovery, all the theories pertaining to Irvine are still valid,” says Hemmlab. “Except perhaps for that statement by one Tibetan that Irvine was taken down the mountain and is now in Lhasa. We can definitely rule that one out.”

After Mallory was found, several additional expeditions returned to search for Irvine without success. Hemmleb took part in a 2001 trip, and Synnott led a National Geographic expedition that performed a search flying small drones in a grid pattern across a large search area. They found no sign of Irvine.

Perhaps the most creative attempt to shed light on the mystery came in 2007 when Anker and a young British climber named Leo Houlding attempted to climb the mountain using only period replica gear of the sort that would have been available in 1924.

Dressed as Mallory and Irvine in seven layers of wool and gabardine, Anker and Houlding felt reasonably comfortable at altitude. But they didn’t make it far beyond the North Col before realizing that if they really tried to climb the mountain in leather boots, they were going to lose toes.

In a film calledWildest Dreamthat documents their climb, both Anker and Houlding go to great lengths to leave open the possibility that Mallory and Irvine could have done in leather hobnail boots what these trained professionals struggled to do in modern gear. But today, Anker admits that the climb would have been exceptionally difficult—particularly the scramble up the notoriously steep geological feature known as the Second Step. “It’s the highest altitude free climbing on the planet,” he says.

There’s of course a chance that the conditions or snowpack were different back then and the Second Step—near where they were last spotted—wasn’t as difficult. There’s even a chance that Mallory and Irvine found an as-yet-unknown route that circumvents the Second Step. But when it comes to the fate of Irvine, Anker believes the simplest story probably explains how he ended up in the central Rongbuk Glacier down below. Back in 1924, Mallory’s body came to a stop and Irvine’s kept going: “I think that he was swept off the mountain.”

With the discovery of Irvine’s boot, a new and promising search area has now been established. Could it reveal more remains—or even artifacts like a camera? To Jimmy Chin, who was leading the expedition when the boot was recovered, finding a camera would be “the Holy Grail of discoveries,” he says.(Interestingly, Chin raced back from Everest last week in order to begin promoting his new National Geographic filmEndurance, which takes up the story of another incredible discovery from the annals of adventure).

“I like to think that there's a possibility that it could be found,” Chin says of the camera, “But if you see this glacier, I mean, there are moulins and crevasses everywhere, hundreds of feet deep. You just don’t know if the camera or anything else could have melted out 10 years ago and got washed into a massive crevasse. And then it’s going to be gone for another 200 years. But I also like to think that there’s always a possibility that it could be found.”

Of course, experts, like Jamie Owen, manager of the photo collection at London’s Royal Geographical Society (RGS), are tempering expectations that a 100-year-old camera lost on Everest might still contain unexposed film. “I think it remains so incredibly unlikely that the camera would be found in a state that would actually give us any sort of relevant information,” says Owen. “I mean, if it’s constantly freezing and unfreezing or being exposed to avalanches and then glacier action, then I think it’s very unlikely that there’s anything meaningful you’re going to get from it.”

Hemmleb acknowledges the diminishingly small chance that there might be salvageable images inside any camera that turns up, but he also points to other items that could still provide meaningful insight.

“I mean, there could be notes in his pocket, an oxygen rig, some broken rope on the body,” says Hemmleb. He also raises the possibility that there  may have been more than one camera.

Expedition member Howard Somervell famously loaned Mallory his Kodak Vest Pocket camera for the ill-fated summit attempt, but Irvine was also an experienced photographer and may have carried with him his own camera.

Some of Irvine’s photographs were recently published by the RGS in a collection celebrating the 100th anniversary of the expedition. “Clearly he had a camera and was very accomplished in using it,” says Owen, who curated the photography in the book.

It’s too early to know whether an additional search expedition will be organized for spring of 2025, the next window of opportunity. Chin isn’t disclosing where exactly he found the boot—but he shared that it was located far from where previous searches focused.  “It was miles away from where other people were looking,” says Chin. “People were just off by a long, long way.”

Owen cautions that just because the general location of the remains is now known doesn’t mean they should be recovered.

“We are of the view that any remains should be left in peace,” says the RGS’s Owen. “We believe that they should be left in-situ, undisturbed, and the position of them not be disclosed. I think doing so risks cheapening the memory of these expeditions.”

95,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/devils-thumb-summit-alex-honnold-tommy-caldwell,"Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell are two of the world’s best climbers. Why did they add a 2,600-mile odyssey of biking, boating, rafting, and rowing just to reach one of America’s most formidable mountains?

Not that long ago, the world’s great rock climbers clawed their way up spectacular cliffs in relative obscurity. But two of the sport’s best have changed all that. Over the past decade, Tommy Caldwell and Alex Honnold have pulled off a string of pioneering feats, starred in highly successful documentaries, and pushed climbing into the mainstream, all of which has transformed both men into global celebrities. Caldwell’s breakout came in 2015, when he and a partner completed what was then considered the world’s most difficult climb, a 19-day ascent of Yosemite’s Dawn Wall. Two years later, Honnold put the term “free solo” into general usage when he summited the park’s iconic El Capitan monolith without a rope, which was captured in an Academy Award–winning film.

Though they remain passionately committed to climbing, each has become increasingly vocal about environmental issues. So last summer, they teamed up to try something new. Caldwell had become interested in “ecopointing,” a term popularized by some European climbers to describe a human-powered adventure that produces zero fossil fuel emissions. What, he wondered, would be the ultimate green expedition?

The pair targeted the Devils Thumb—an isolated 9,000-foot Alaska mountain that many consider to be unclimbable. To make things even more epic, the friends set off on bicycles from Caldwell’s Colorado home, plotting a 2,600-mile course through some of North America’s most scenic landscapes. The odyssey that followed involved a sailboat, sea kayaks, pack rafts, and a bushwhacking trek through virgin rainforest, not to mention world-class rock climbing.

The Devil’s Climb,a new National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+, chronicles their journey. Writer Mark Synnott, a professional mountain guide and National Geographic Explorer, spoke with Caldwell, 46, and Honnold, 39, about what they encountered along their route; the hidden challenges of ecopointing; how they balance risk and responsibility as fathers of young children; and the perilous etiquette of picture taking when perched on a summit the size of a pizza box. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Mark Synnott: Where did the idea for this trip come from?

Tommy Caldwell:I’ve always wanted to do a long bike ride, and I was overdue for a huge adventure because I didn’t do any during COVID. But most importantly, I saw this as an opportunity to raise awareness about the Tongass National Forest. The Tongass, which covers almost the entire panhandle of Alaska, is the biggest temperate rainforest in the world, and I’d been trying to conceive of ways to make its protection a higher-profile issue. I knew about the Devils Thumb from reading [Jon] Krakauer’s account of trying to climb it, and I was also inspired by the road trip to Patagonia that Doug Tompkins and Yvon Chouinard did back in the day. Originally, I wanted to ride my bike to Alaska solo, but then I realized that it would be way more fun to do it with a friend, so I called Alex. At first, he said no.



Alex Honnold:To be clear, I said no because Tommy’s original idea included sea kayaking the entire coast of Alaska. It was a two-and-a-half-month trip, which was too long to be away from my family. At first, I was considering joining for some of the rock climbing along the way, but it seemed silly to miss the main thrust of the expedition. I’ve done a couple of cool biking adventures, and I’ve always felt that it’s a great way to immerse yourself in the landscape. So I was kind of hopeful that this adventure would be sort of like a personal transformation or something.

Synnott: Did that pan out?

Honnold:Not really. It was an incredible adventure, and we did a lot of cool climbs. But honestly, the biking across the West felt like a grind, and what I saw kind of made me sad. We got to see the human impact on nature in a way that I just haven’t been exposed to before. We biked 2,400 miles, and basically the only places that felt untrammeled were the national parks. Everything else felt like it had been logged or mined or somehow extracted. And a lot of the communities we biked through just didn’t seem like they were thriving. The town gets big when they’re cutting down all the trees, and then the trees are all cut down, and the place collapses.

Caldwell:Witnessing all this human impact, which is kind of why we were doing the trip in the first place, only reinforced how much [of the world] we’ve already destroyed. And it really showed how important our national parks are because they were the only places that were super pristine.

Honnold:I went into the trip with no real knowledge of interior British Columbia, and I just kind of assumed that as we got farther north, there would be more and more wild and virgin forest. It turns out that it’s all been clear-cut over the last hundred years. Sure, there’s a little screen of trees along the road, and when you’re whizzing by at 75 miles an hour in a car, that’s all you see. But when you’re biking, you have time to see past the screen, and it’s like, “Oh, wow, there’s no trees out there.” As rock climbers, we spend so much time in wild nature, on mountaintops, and in the most remote, obscure places, so I think I had this false perception that there was still a lot of untouched nature out there. And so I guess the takeaway is that the only places on Earth that have not had massive human impact are the places that are just too difficult to get to or have nothing of economic value.

Caldwell:Totally. The extraction companies always justify it by saying that it’s going to bring economic prosperity, but it never lasts. And the communities suffer. In interior B.C. we witnessed people smoking crack, crazy domestic abuse, and an active shooter situation. We rode along a road they call the Highway of Tears, where a lot of Indigenous people have been abducted. I think it all comes down to the fact that we’ve raped the landscape, and the communities are just following suit. It was a good reminder that we have to figure out how to rein things in, because if we keep going the way we are, eventually even the most remote places are going to be extracted too.

Synnott: Please tell me you also had some positive experiences.

Honnold:Of course. One day I was biking along, and I looked up and saw an eagle flying over me carrying a prairie dog, and I was like, “Welcome to Wyoming.” There were so many sunrises and sunsets, and I remember biking over the Icefields Parkway in Alberta in a storm and having it hit me that we were truly living outdoors in nature. And isn’t that kind of the point of adventure?

Caldwell:In southern Wyoming the landscape just came to life for me. There were rainbows and rain squalls sweeping across the landscape and wild horses that would run up to meet us. When the road ran out, we sailed the final leg to the Devils Thumb up the Inside Passage. On stormy days, we’d park the boat in little coves and go sea kayaking. There’d be otters cracking shells open with little rocks. One day I paddled up on an island with like 50 seals on it that all slipped into the ocean when I approached. And we came across this phenomenon called bubble-net feeding, where humpback whales, hunting in a pack, swim around in a circle and put up a net of bubbles that corral the fish, and then the whales all breach at once and you see like 10 open mouths. On the hike into the mountain, there was a salmon run where it seemed like the river had more fish than water. There were thousands of carcasses all over the place, and the bears were going to town.

Synnott: You guys climbed the Devils Thumb, a notoriously hard-core mountain. Now that you’re both parents, does having children change your risk calculus at all?

Honnold:Ha! I know you would probably bet against me making it to 40, but as Tommy often says, I didn’t want to die before I had kids, and I still don’t want to die now that I do. The bigger change has been with the way I spend my time. My kids are getting to the age where they’re fun, and I want to hang out with my daughters and do cool things. And so I suspect that as I spend more time at home, I’ll probably take less risk. But I could also just as easily see it going the other way, where every once in a while I go extra hard because, man, I just love soloing walls. And, you know, road biking 2,400 miles on the side of a highway is probably more dangerous than a lot of the climbing I do.

Synnott: More dangerous than free soloing El Capitan?

Honnold:(chuckling) Well, maybe not that.

Caldwell:When I was a young climber, my dad always told me that I should stay away from ice climbing and free soloing … I don’t want to go die in the Himalayas. I’ve been around so many people that have gone to climb the biggest mountains in the world and gotten themselves divorced or killed. Still, I suppose I have a relatively high risk tolerance, but I don’t crave risk the way Alex does. I’m willing to put up with it at times, but I try to make sure that I stay below the line that is acceptable for me. If anything, though, I’ve probably loosened it slightly over the years as I’ve become more confident in my abilities.

Synnott: What is it about climbing that you find so compelling?

Caldwell:It’s the relationships you form, the community, the immersion in nature, the need for adventure. It’s so many things that it’s hard to pin it on just one.

Honnold:I just freaking love the movement of climbing and how it offers so many op-portunities to try to improve and to take on new challenges.

Synnott: What stands out about this particular climb?

Honnold:We did the Diablo Traverse, which is the five summits of the Devils Thumb massif. We did it free, in a day—by no means cutting-edge, but it was cool.

Caldwell:The Cats Ears Spire might have been the most insane summit I’ve ever been on. The landscape is so menacing. The mountains are really pointy. There are big icefalls and avalanches coming down the northwest face all the time, so you hear this rumbling.

Honnold:One summit was like the size of a pizza box—the kind of summit where it’s hard to take pictures of each other because you’re just like standing on this tiny thing, and you’re like, “Back up; I can’t get you in the frame,” and then you both fall to your death. (Laughs)

Synnott: Why did you want to try to make the trip using only human power?

Caldwell:European climbers are into this idea of ecopointing, which is basically getting to the crags without cars. Then this Belgian friend, Sébastien Berthe, wanted to repeat the Dawn Wall, but he doesn’t fly on airplanes. So he decided to sail across the Atlantic. What would’ve been a month-long trip became an epic six-month journey. I met him and his crew in Yosemite, and I could tell the experience really bonded them. When you put up these guardrails around your adventure for an environmental reason, it just makes the trip way bigger and cooler.

Synnott: Your production team’s trip wasn’t as green. How did you square that?

Caldwell:I thought about it a lot. It’s one of those things where you have to decide between doing something that’s totally green or you can tell a compelling story. I felt that spreading the word [about what’s happening in the Tongass National Forest] was worth compromising on the greenness of the trip.

Honnold:It’s tough to do a green expedition in a fossil fuel–soaked world. We tried to sail part of it, but the wind and the tides weren’t right, so we were just moving under diesel the whole time. If we’d flown in a small plane, it almost certainly would’ve used less fuel. A lot of the expedition felt that way, like, This is an amazing adventure, but is this really the way?

Caldwell:I see what Alex is saying. Ecopointing is not the environmental solution to the world, but thinking about environmental solutions turned this into an immersive two-month-long expedition that was honestly one of the best experiences of my life.

96,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-maine-the-escape-to-nature-is-more-than-a-getaway-its-a-lifestyle,"Less than an hour from downtown Portland, National Geographic Photographer Michael George finds surfing, river sanctuaries, and a Civil War-era fort.

It is a bold choice to make your state’s motto “Vacationland.” InMaine, the phrase is spotted on license plates, welcome signs, and t-shirts. It is an open-arms invitation for visitors, but also a mantra for the year-round Mainers who live a more laid-back lifestyle compared to their neighbors in the Northeast (New Yorkers and vacationland?Fuhgeddaboudit.) In a small stretch of coastline fromScarboroughtoFreeport, there are countless examples of Maine’s commitment to building cities in harmony with nature, not against it. This interlacing of waterfalls and river sanctuaries with urban delights is one of many ways life here is designed to remind you to slow down and take a walk. It may only be your hour-long lunch break, but that’s enough for a short vacation.

Less than 20 minutes from downtown Portland, I set out to experience three distinct beaches.Two Lights State Parkhas the classic cascading cliffside of rocks where ocean waves crash along the unique formations. I do feel the need to write a quick PSA: despite the name, the park harbors no lighthouses within its borders–its namesake lighthouses are located just down the road. But what the park does offer are colorful tide pools and many benches hidden among its pathways to relax and take it all in. As a Floridian with the irrational and entrenched belief that the ocean should be the temperature of bathwater, I prefer to stay dry and watch the Atlantic smash against the rocks.

However, for those of youwitha backbone,Scarborough Beach, with its long stretch of white sandy beach, is a popular spot for surfers and swimmers. Walking along the cool edge of the water, I am excited to see surfers of all ages and genders tackling the waves. No surf rage in sight here. Nestled in between Scarborough and Two Lights, I stop atHiggins Beach, an inviting small town with classic houses right along the shore. At this early hour, dogs are comingling, and a fly fisherman tells me this is a special spot to catch striped bass. Regardless of how you like to enjoy the ocean, every option is within a short drive.

Back in Portland, I travel from the Old Port toBack Cove, a 3.6-mile loop around an estuary basin with a picturesque view of the city skyline. Driving the cobblestone streets, Portland feels like someone took the small port from another city and hit it with a growth ray. The charming neighborhoods here are the whole thing. I continue past brick industrial buildings and elegant Queen Anne-style homes to arrive atPresumpscot River Preserve Trail. Walking from the Presumpscot Falls Bridge, after a half-mile it feels like I am hours from the city. Large herons and other birds sit along the waterfront, and a low fog settles in the forest. I climb over a few trees that fell after a recent storm. It feels wild despite being steps from civilization.

This reaction is echoed when I exploreFore River Sanctuarylater in the day. Hiking by train tracks into a thick wooded area, I find Jewel Falls, Portland’s only natural waterfall. Local families are walking with their kids and dogs. One charismatic pup with an endearing limp approaches me for a scratch. Her owner is excited to share, “We walk here every day. It’s her favorite place, though she shouldn’t drink from the falls.” I look down. She’s drinking from the falls. But who am I to deny this indulgence? After all, she’s on vacation too.

One of the unexpected sights from the East End of Portland isFort Gorges, a historic military fort dating back to the mid-1800s and built on a small island not far from the piers. I want a closer look, and Zack Anchors, co-founder and owner ofPortland Paddle, is just the person to get me there. I hold back a joke about his fitting last name as we climb into our kayaks. Zack, like many Mainers I talk with, left the state for a while but eventually came home. With easy access to the water, he guides day trips and multi-day excursions around the surrounding archipelago. “There aren’t many places where you can explore thousands of islands, many of which are uninhabited,” he says.

Even with the tide and wind against us, it doesn’t take long to arrive at Fort Gorges. Pulling our kayaks up on the shore, I feel a mythical sense of discovery. The architecture of the fort looms overhead, and native plants sprout along the top. Though nature has worked hard to take it back, the nonprofit Friends of Fort Gorges is committed to preserving and invigorating the space with arts and culture. They’ve hosted events like live opera singers and scavenger hunts. It is a stunning location for a show, a wedding, or, you know, to reenact a gladiator showdown. There are spiral stone staircases, and I marvel at the hand-carved granite slabs that were somehow transported out across the bay. Maintaining this space for the public is a never-ending battle with the elements. Storms wear away at the wharf and large tides shift the sand. Regardless, the Friends of Fort Gorges are committed and has grand visions to continue reimagining the fort for years to come.

Eager to learn more about the strength of the tides, I head toWolfe’s Neck Woods State Park, a dynamic peninsula just southeast of Freeport. I approach park manager Andrew Hutchinson, or “Ranger Andy,” who has worked for the park service for 40 years. At low tide, a massive expanse of mud is exposed, and he takes out a few tools to harvest a clam. Visitors at Wolfe's Neck can legally clam here without a license. In a few hours, the park will be unrecognizable. Islands become islands again, and water fills in the gaps between large slabs of rock. We amble across a bridge, and Andy stops me, pointing through a small break in the trees. An osprey nest is perfectly positioned atop a withered tree. As if on cue, an osprey chick pops its head above the edge of the nest. “They’ve nested here as long as we have recorded history,” Andy observes. I rave about how everywhere I’ve been is next door to neighborhoods and restaurants, but here the nature is pristine. It’s like traveling through portals into the natural world.

Mainers also take care of their land, acting as careful stewards of the bountiful nature that surrounds them. Experiencing this commitment so thoroughly, I’ve grown a connection to these serene oases in a matter of days. My time is wrapping up, and I think, “You can’t be on vacation ALL the time.” Isn’t that the point of vacation? It’s special because it’s temporary, fleeting: Magic found in a finite suspension of reality. Driving south out of Portland, I spot two neighbors talking over a white picket fence, laughing in the soon-to-be summer twilight. These folks have found a way to make a state of mind usually found only on vacation a part of their everyday lives. The speed limit increases from 30 to 45 to 60. My foot is hesitant to press the gas pedal down farther, life in the fast lane is coming back too quickly. It’s always hard when a vacation ends, but it’s even harder when you’re leaving Vacationland."
97,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-autumnal-adventures-campbell-river,"The islands and inlets of Campbell River, on the eastern coast of Vancouver Island, can provide plenty of exhilarating wilderness experiences — if you know where to look.

Ethereal old-growth rainforests. Vast, empty beaches strewn with driftwood. Dramatic cliffs and secluded coves. This is the scenery synonymous with Canada’s Vancouver Island. Located off the Pacific coast of British Columbia, this wild island is one and a half times the size of Wales. The Indigenous First Nations, who have called the island home for around 14,000 years, believe that by respecting nature, visitors grow closer to the temperate rainforest and its creatures.

The city of Campbell River, located on the island’s eastern shore, is a particular standout for its wildlife experiences— especially in autumn, when vibrant fall foliage colours the landscape in gold and crimson hues and nature is on the move. Bears forage in old-growth rainforests, salmon leap from the water and breaching humpbacks greet the morning light. Here are five of the best wildlife adventures to enjoy the region.

Located on the doorstep of one of the world’s most impressive salmon migrations, Campbell River proudly claims to be the ‘Salmon Capital of the World’ — a title supported by the unique opportunity to don a wetsuit, mask and fins to float among thousands of pink, chinook, chum and coho salmon. These hook-nosed natives return to the gravel beds at the upper reaches of the Campbell River to spawn every June to November, highlighting the vibrant life of this landscape. This abundant salmon population, and the namesake town’s resulting success as a commercial fishing hub, can be credited to Discovery Passage, which acts as a natural funnel, guiding migrating fish right to Campbell River’s doorstep.

Since 1985,Ocean Fix Dive Centrehas monitored this remarkable migration and offers self-guided River Run tours, a unique Canadian experience that’s hard to find elsewhere. Starting from a logging bridge on the Gold River Highway and ending at Maple Street in Campbell River town, the float down the river takes around 30–40 minutes, weaving beneath bridges and under the watchful eye of bald eagles nesting in the surrounding Douglas firs. Spot curious harbour seals around the exit point — they will often congregate to suss out the new visitors to their waters. To snorkel like a pro, relax your breathing and float gently on your stomach with your legs straight and arms in front of you, trying to keep as still as possible.

Campbell River is the best access point to the Bute and Toba Inlets, which are home to packs of hulking grizzly bears who, during the autumn months, can often be spotted on the shoreline dredging up fat, unsuspecting salmon from the powerful currents. Grizzlies can be spotted in this area from August to October, with September and October being prime viewing season. For the best chances of spotting the bears from a safe distance in their natural habitat, embark on aguided excursionwith the Homalco First Nation. Known as the ‘people of the fast-running waters’, they have been navigating these lands and waters since time immemorial.

Their half- and full-day tours take visitors to a variety of hotspots, including Algard Creek and Orford River, where the omnivores can be found foraging for berries and bivalves as they wait for the salmon run. Motor across the Bute Inlet, one of British Columbia’s premier whale-spotting channels, then join Indigenous guides on camouflaged platforms and towers to watch nature hard at work.

Alternatively, the Homalco’s sister tribe, the Klahoose First Nation, offers expeditions to nearby Toba Inlet, north of Desolation Sound. Here, travellers can cruise one of British Columbia’s most spectacular fjords to see waterfalls and untouched rainforest.

Many companies offer whale-watching excursions throughout British Columbia, but few have a history as distinguished asEagle Eye Adventures. This carbon-neutral Campbell River wildlife tour operator was one of the first to be certified as a responsible whale watcher and its conservation initiatives actively support cetacean research efforts, including those of the World Cetacean Alliance and Marine Education and Research Society (MERS).

Eagle Eye Adventures offers two options for its six-hour tours: an exhilarating, pulse-quickening Zodiac tour, or a more relaxed covered-boat excursion, both of which plumb the depths of the Johnstone Strait for marine activity. Both are led by knowledgeable naturalists and marine biologists, offering the chance to spot orcas, humpbacks, porpoises, dolphins, sea lions and seals. Travellers might even catch sight of a bear cracking mussels and molluscs along the rugged shorelines of the islets surrounding Quadra Island.

While the names of the archipelagos and channels off Vancouver Island have changed on maps over the years, one thing remains constant: the narrow passages offer unrivalled spots to witness unforgettable marine life. This includes orcas, Pacific white-sided dolphins, sea lions and humpback whales. There are various tricks for seeking out the latter, including the use of onboard hydrophones to eavesdrop on whale calls.

For the best chances of spotting humpbacks, embark on a guided excursion withCampbell River Whale Watching Toursto visit the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait, where the sheltered coves of the Inside Passage act as harbours for marine life. Both six-hour and full-day tours are available on either covered vessel or Zodiac, and they offer nature experiences that are worlds apart from the touristy trips of Vancouver. Highlights abound, but Quadra and Cortes Islands, fringed by wild sandy beaches, are as worthy of telephoto camera shots as any tail fluke or flipper.

The Tyee Spit is a narrow strip of land that juts out into the waters off Campbell River. The rising sea fog may remind you of the Hebrides or the Irish coast, but the horizon of lofty, snow-polished mountains is unmistakably Canadian. Visitors can embark on various walking trails, such as the scenic three-mile route to Dick Murphy Park between the Discovery Passage and Campbell River estuary, but the main draw of the Tyee Spit is undeniably its fishing.

Named after thetyee— an Indigenous term for 'chief' or 'leader' that is used in the region to refer to a chinook salmon that weighs more than 30lbs — the Tyee Spit is a haven for anglers and sport fishing under the rules of theTyee Club. Established in 1924, it’s one of British Columbia’s true, lesser-known treasures. Bait and barbed hooks are not allowed, and anglers must fish from a traditional rowboat, handling the nine-foot rod and reel on their own. Success relies on skill and finesse, but those who manage to land a 30-pounder will earn a place in the exclusive Tyee Club of British Columbia.

98,National Geographic,Adventure,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/paid-content-your-next-adventure-london-england,"Join National Geographic photographer Jonathan Irish as he explores London’s iconic landmarks, lush green spaces, and cultural hot spots in search of new ways to enjoy this captivating city.

From Big Ben—the massive, 15-ton bell that sits within the Great Clock of Elizabeth Tower, Westminster—to the gothic facade of the Houses of Parliament,Londonis awash in iconic buildings that feel instantly familiar. Though for National Geographic photographerJonathan Irish, even return trips can feel new if you take the time to explore beyond the tried and true. “London is such a big city, but you can get into spaces where it doesn’t feel that way at all,” says Irish. “The way I do it is to go slow. Because the slower you go, the more you see.”

DiscoverLondon, England, through Irish’s lens, and see why this city should be your next adventure.

Immersing oneself in London’s culture is essential for a memorable trip, and for Irish, this meant stopping byLock&Co. Hatters.

The history of hats in London reflects the city’s rich cultural evolution, from the iconicbowler hatsof the Victorian era to the fashionablecouture hatsseen at royal events, showcasing centuries of style and social significance.Lock&Co. Hatters, established in 1676, represents the pinnacle of British heritage and craftsmanship.

The 19th-century wooden hatmaker’s tools and mechanical sizing instruments scattered throughout the store create an atmosphere that makes you feel as if you’re stepping back in time. Visitors will also find the walls adorned with framed andsigned headshapes of notable figures who have worn their handiwork, and the amiable shopkeepers are also a wealth of knowledge on all things related to London history and culture. While there, Irish learned that in Victorian London, it was a mark of respect and formality to wear a hat on Sundays to church and for other social occasions.

As for style and fits, the shop boasts something for every occasion, but it was thetraditional bowlerhat that caught Irish’s eye. “I’m not sure yet when or where I’ll wear it,” Irish says of his new prize. “But it fits me perfectly, and is a classic.”

Another must-do when trying to embrace British culture? A traditional Sunday roast. “In the U.S., we have Sunday dinner; in England, they have Sunday roast. It’s a time-honored tradition, andThe Dickens Innis the perfect place for it,” says Irish.

The meal typically includes roasted meats, potatoes, and a selection of root vegetables, with gravy and Yorkshire pudding on the side. Hearty eaters can round all that out with the 18th-century inn’s selection of appetizers (don’t miss the pork and sage Scotch egg) and desserts (sticky toffee pudding is a must).

And no cultural adventure through London would be complete without a stop at theLondon Review Bookshop. Opened in the heart of Bloomsbury in 2003, the shop quickly established itself as an essential part of the capital’s cultural life. Today, you’ll find about 20,000 titles on the shop’s shelves, along with a space where people can gather, meet authors, and discuss big ideas.

With more than 3,000 parks dotting the city, it’s likely that visitors could overlook a few. But one to add to your list:Saint Dunstan in the East Church Garden​.

This enchanting urban green oasis sits among the ruins of an old church that was severely damaged in both the 1666 Great Fire of London and the Blitz of 1941. In 1970, the space opened as a garden, and well-placed benches now encourage guests to pause and take it all in. The natural vines and greenery running among the gray-stone ruins create a woodland feel, allowing tourists and locals alike to enjoy moments of calm right in the heart of a bustling city.

For those willing to trek a bit farther out, be sure to take a “ramble” (as Londoners call it) toHampstead Heath. Less than four miles from London’s city center, this free, public park offers more than 800 acres of woodlands, meadows, and breathtaking English gardens, and beckons those who enjoy quiet, green spaces and people watching. For epic views of the city, pop up to theParliament Hillviewpoint, where the hubbub of central London feels a world away.

Other must-sees include theViaduct Bridge, a striking example of Victorian engineering set amid lush greenery, andThe Hill Garden and Pergola, a hidden gem with stunning terraced gardens and charming, overgrown pergolas that offer a tranquil retreat.

If you’re hungry after your stroll, be sure to check out nearbyGinger&Whitefor a caffeine boost and a bite to eat. “It’s a very quaint neighborhood, and where we had one of the best meals of the entire trip,” says Irish. He recommends the coffee (“some of the best I’ve ever had”) and the Blythburgh bacon sandwich (a seemingly simple concoction topped with arugula, avocado, and chili mayo that packs a punch).

While the returning tourist might scoff at suggestions to embrace some of London’s classic landmarks, the truth is that no trip to London would be complete without them. Places like theLondon Eye,Westminster Abbey, andSt. James’s Parkare popular for a reason. On your next trip, consider seeing them in new ways.

To start, board the elevator for a 41-second trip to the 833-foot top ofHorizon 22. There, almost scraping the clouds, London’s highest free viewing platform offers floor-to-ceiling panoramic views of the city and its iconic landmarks. “It’s always good to get a bird’s-eye view of a place when you’re experiencing it, and this provides probably the best one,” says Irish. “You’re in the heart of the city while looking out over it.”

Another great way to take in the London skyscape is from the water. A cruise on theRiver Thameswith an operator likeCity Experiencesis a chance to snap photos of theTower Bridge,London Bridge, andBig Benwhile relaxing on a two-hour cruise, drink in hand and enjoying live jazz music on deck. For photographers, the shift in perspective is a chance to see things anew.

And, of course, packing a good pair of walking shoes for your visit is a no-brainer. The city’s neighborhoods make it easy to craft your own route, discoverself-guidedtours, or rely on local experts throughguided walking tours.

When approached with time and patience, London reveals itself. Gems are hidden in plain sight, and wandering is often the best way to spot them. Irish discovered the city’s eclectic personality in spots likeNeal’s Yard―a colorful alleyway chockablock with shops and cafes inCovent Garden. “It feels like a secret,” Irish says. “Like you’ve stumbled upon a really special place.”

Over near the River Thames in Southwark, Irish found theRuins of Winchester Palace. The 12th-century buildings were once palatial in stature and home to the city’s powerful bishops. Today, you’ll find the ruins, including a gorgeous medieval rose window, still stand tall.

For a different peek at history, visitthe Golden Hinde, a full-size reconstruction of the famous Elizabethan galleon, or get lost in the historicBorough Market, where you can chat with food purveyors and local traders as Londoners have since 1756.

Londonis calling: Whether this is your first visit or your 100th, you’ll find a city brimming with unique and captivating wonders, especially if you take the time to soak it all in.

99,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/impact/article/sandesh-kadur-explorer-story,"The photographer, filmmaker and author wields his iconic imagery as a means of conservation.

“As we’re sitting there, legs dangling down from a tree, 15 feet below us a leopard walks in the beautiful moonlight. It was one of the most extraordinary sightings of a leopard I’ve ever had.”

In 25 years of wildlife storytelling,National Geographic ExplorerSandesh Kadur has seen and documented more rare moments in nature than most people experience in a lifetime.

“Then, the leopard goes to the tree next to us and puts its paws up. It scratches the tree, puts its paws down, saws and disappears into the darkness,” Kadur recalls of the moment that set him on the course of his life’s work.

He was a 15-year-old boy in Bangalore, India who had buried himself in books about big cats, mostly books by hunter-turned-conservationistJim Corbett. Inspired, Kadur and a friend rode their bikes into the jungle one night and pedaled toward a particular tree that sat above a watering hole, one frequented by the “man-eating tigers or leopards” described in Cobertt’s literature. Kadur had, in his imagination, camped out with Corbett in moonlit trees several times before, waiting for big cats. This time it was real.

“In that beautiful dappled moonlight and shadow, that’s when I realized that this was what I wanted to do when I grew up. Experience moments like this, capture them and share them with the world.”

As an acclaimed wildlife filmmaker and photographer, Kadur has dedicated his life to illuminating endangered species and their fragile habitats. He shares them with the world through his visual storytelling, which offers his audiences first-time glimpses into rarely-seen phenomena in the natural world, and urges viewers to protect its vulnerable inhabitants.

He’s tracked Indonesian birds to their breeding grounds, trailed sea turtles in Mexico and scoured the remote Himalayas looking for elusiveclouded leopardswith his camera in hand. HisSecrets of the King Cobra documentary (2009) shows the seldom-observed behaviors of the longest venomous snakes in the world — their courting, fighting, mating, nest building, even cannibalism — and he unveiled the vital ecosystems of theWestern Ghats

on film.

“To me storytelling is about transcending all barriers, influencing, and making impact.”

Right now, Kadur is following a century-old scientific trail through the eastern Himalayas. He is leading a team — wildlife biologists, ecologists, botanists, herpetologists, an ecohydrologist, an entomologist, a lepidopterist, a malacologist, professional researchers,birders and climbers and one medic — in the second phase of their quest to bridge the gap between science and storytelling as they discover and classify new species to academic science across India’s Siang Valley. The Expedition is a collaboration betweenConservania, a nature and education non-profit co-founded by Kadur, the National Geographic Society, Kadur’s Felis Creations production house and theAshoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment(ATREE). Kadur is at the helm of the endeavor, leading the team across the Siang Gorge, following a path made by British explorers who once combed the same forested valleys for new flora and fauna.

“A hundred years ago, they compiled this amazing book called the “Zoological Results of the Abor Expedition.” Very few places on the planet have such a detailed, comprehensive report. So I thought, ‘wouldn’t it be amazing to go back 100 years later with new technology, new science?’”

The 1911-1912 Abor Expedition was conducted during a single winter as part of aninfamous colonial expeditionthat led Europeans through the Siang Valley’s forests. Thezoological surveyrevealed a fraction of the region’s biodiversity, from worms, frogs, insects and plants never before documented in South Asia.

Over the course of two years, Kadur’s Expedition team has identified at least 15 new species to academic science, and rediscovered others that were once presumed lost.

“There is a four-horned beetle, never seen before. I counted. Four horns,” Kadur exclaims. The entomologist was so stumped, he lost sleep for two days trying to classify it. “It turned out to be a whole new genus. Not just a species, a whole new genus.”

“There’s a brand new parasitoid wasp. A tiny, microscopic species. One of the scientists named that one after me,” he laughs.

But the most significant finding so far is not a new species, but the sighting of a particular velvet worm that caught the eye of the Abor scientists a century ago.Typhloperipatus williamsoniwas described first in 1911, but remained an enigma until Kadur’s team spotted a few again more than 100 years later.

“It’s referred to as a living fossil. It is one of the most ancient biological creatures on the planet.” Kadur explains. The animal is a brownish-red color, has no eyes and more than a dozen legs.

And its mysterious distribution between India and the Andes suggests an ancient migration that likely occurred before the split of a supercontinent, Kadur explains.

The Siang Rivertranslates to “the river that flows through our heart” in Adi, explains Kadur. It is derived from the language of theAdi peoplewho inhabit the state of Arunachal Pradesh. “Its sanctity is reflected in its name alone,” says Kadur, and the water flow supports more than 500 million people — but it is not fully protected. The boom inhydroelectric damconstruction is threatening supply and local livelihoods.

“Our hope is that some of these urgent studies that we are doing shows the significance of the findings, and the importance of conserving this system, which is important to all life,” says Kadur.

Kadur has risen through the ranks as an avid advocate for global conservation efforts, known for his up close and at times cheeky storytelling. His films have appeared worldwide on the National Geographic Channel, the BBC, Netflix’s Our Planet and more. He’s also been named the BBC’s Photographer of the Year, and Environmental Photographer of the Year by The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEN). He was twice nominated for Green Oscar nominations at Wildscreen Festival.

“I believe people forget what’s not seen. So my job is to uncover the unseen and really bring the significance of those unseen species to life.”

His love for nature, particularly birds, oozed out of him since he was a kid. He remembers his first camera, borrowed from his father when he was 12 or 13 years old.

“Oh it was this magic box. You could freeze a moment and then see it again later. A “technological marvel” at the time.

His entomologist father got him looking at the small things. He began intentionally focusing his lens from species to species, from small insects to enormous elephants, trying to understand what he was looking at. “My primary interest has always been to figure out what things are. Basic, fundamental science.” He would develop the camera film weeks later, annotating the settings he had and reattempting the shots. “The learning process was slow and tedious but also fun and deep-rooted.”

As he got older, his love for nature grew, but his studies suffered. “I continued to go out and sit in a tree on full moon nights, but it didn’t really help with finishing school,” Kadur says. “When you fail in high school in India, that’s the end of the road.”

In an attempt to rebound from his deviation, he set out to study hotel management thousands of miles from his childhood exploration grounds in Bangalore, and relocated to Brownsville, Texas.

It would prove an unlikely catalyst for his eventual return to storytelling.

Along the United States coastline and straddling national borders, Brownsville gave Kadur easy access to Mexico’s cloud forests. His fame as the “bird guy” landed him a job as a jungle tour guide for Audubon Sierra Club groups. He mingled with other nature lovers, including Belgian filmmaker John Bax, who had just wrapped a project in the Mexican cloud forests. Kadur introduced Bax to the same cloud forest systems of western India. They prepared to embark on a documentary project together, with Kadur as Bax’s apprentice, but Bax had to drop out just before they set out.

If 19-year-old Kadur, who until this point had never worked in film, wanted to still pursue the project, he was on his own.

One of his college professors covered Kadur’s costs on a personal credit card. “Bless his heart … he buys me my first camcorder and tripod and sends me off.

Kadur read the equipment manuals on the plane and wound up spending three years back in India, refining his skill on this single piece of work. When he returned to Brownsville, his community college had become The University of Texas. The institution, which does not have a filmmaking department, awarded him a degree in biology.

“Sahyadris: Mountains of the Monsoon”(2008), Kadur’s first-ever film, premiered the mountain jungles that house some of India’s most iconic wildlife to the world: lion-tailed macaque monkeys, king cobras, and other species caught for the first time on film, like the Pogeyan, known as the “smoke cat” in Sanskrit language.

Recognized as one of the world’s hottest hotspots of biological diversity, theWestern Ghats were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Sitein 2012, with help from Kadur’s film, which continued to win awards globally. More and more films followed.

“Karma,” he laughs.

In 2013, Kadur became a National Geographic Explorer. He’s since had dozens of photography features in National Geographic magazine and other print publications, becoming known as an avid advocate for wildlife protection through his work.

He says he stuck with visual storytelling because of its universality. Across cultures and generations, humanity has used pictures to share experiences, emotions, ideas and traditions. In his own quest to unearth narratives about the planet’s delicate and rare life, he’s come across the fingerprints of human storytelling across ages.

“In Nagaland, northeast India on huge wooden panels, they had carved pangolins, elephants, king cobras. Several hundred years old. In the monasteries of Bhutan, the monks have painted raptors carrying away a serpent in this beautiful fantasy,” Kadur says. “Visual art has conveyed stories for millennia. Now we’re doing that with technology, and it will continue to advance.”

“I think that the kind of impact storytelling can have can last a lifetime. It can last generations.”

He thinks back to the stories he would disappear into with Corbett. What prompted him to chase the leopard that night. What set off his trajectory and sent him a whirling rush that has carried him to now.

“Even now I still get the same rush, 25 years later. It’s extraordinary how being out in the wild never gets old because everything is new every time. I think that’s what keeps it fresh and that’s what keeps it original, is the feeling that it's never the same.”

100,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/emperor-penguins-behavior-adaptation-diving,"From diving off cliffs to starving for months, emperor penguins are continuing to surprise scientists with their ability to adapt to one of the world’s most extreme environments.

“Oh my god,this thing’s going to die.” That was the thought running through the mind of wildlife filmmakerBertie Gregorywhen he saw the first juvenileemperor penguinjump off a 50-foot cliff. The bird plummeted downward, splashing into the frigid Southern Ocean. After a few suspenseful seconds, it bobbed to the surface and then swam off toward the horizon. TheNational Geographic Explorercouldn’t believe it.

What came next was even more shocking: More penguins from the crowd of several hundred huddled at the edge of the towering ice shelf plunged one by one into the sea. “There was a moment when it was just raining penguins off this cliff,” says Gregory, who captured rare footage of the event with a drone camera in Antarctica’s Atka Bay last year while filmingSecrets of the Penguins,a new National Geographic documentary series. “It was one of the most extraordinary things I’ve ever seen.” Some did graceful swan dives; others slipped and tumbled headlong into the waves. Miraculously, nearly all survived the leap.

Normally, young penguins jump only a couple of feet from floating sea ice into the water when they fledge, says Michelle LaRue, a conservation biologist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. The cliff-diving chicks that Gregory observed may have been raised on the permanent ice shelf and likely took a wrong turn, finding themselves in a tricky location for a water entry while simultaneously motivated by hunger and an ocean brimming with fish beckoning below.

The scene was a true demonstration of the penguins’ fortitude. These fascinating birds have evolved over millions of years to survive on the coldest, windiest, driest continent on Earth.

Many of their most incredible traits can be seen during nesting season, which runs through the most challenging time of year. Female emperor penguins lay a single pear-shaped egg early in the Antarctic winter when temperatures can dip to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit and winds can reach hurricane force. Needing to replenish their energy reserves, they quickly shuffle the eggs to their mates to assume caretaking while they trek out to the ocean to feed.

Male emperor penguins spend the next two months incubating the eggs balanced atop their webbed feet and shielded from the cold by a flap of the penguin’s abdominal skin that forms a pocket, or brood pouch. The soon-to-be fathers will go nearly four months without food, losing roughly half their weight during breeding season. Eggs typically hatch by August, just as the females are returning to provide their young with a first meal. Then the chicks will be fed and warmed by their parents over the next five months.

By mid-December, as the Antarctic summer approaches, the chicks have started to shed their fluffy down for waterproof plumage. Soon they leave their colony and find food on their own. Juveniles like those Gregory filmed take a literal leap of faith into the sea. It is a pivotal moment when they begin their life in the ocean, where they’ll spend an average of five years before returning to breed.

Scientists do not think the cliff-jumping incident was directly related to climate change, but at least one expert speculates thatwarming temperatures may force more emperors to breedon permanent ice shelves instead of sea ice, increasing the chances of juveniles fledging from tall heights. This incident underscores a stark reality: Under some climate scenarios, scientists predict, 80 percent of Antarctica’s emperor penguin colonies will disappear by the turn of the century.

But LaRue remains hopeful about the emperors’ ability to adapt, and she considers the recent high dive a testament to the penguins’ hardiness. “They’re incredibly resilient,” she says. “They have been around for millions of years; they’ve seen lots of different changes in their environment. It’s a question of how rapidly they’re able to deal with the changes that are happening—and how far they can be pushed.”

101,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/hittite-ancient-empire-disappear-mystery,"They fought the Egyptians, sacked Babylon, and built elaborate cities. Then the Hittites vanished. Today, new discoveries are restoring the legend of a forgotten superpower.

At its height,the ancient city of Hattuşa, capital of the Hittite civilization, must have been awe-inspiring. Built into a steep hillside in what is today central Türkiye, the city was ringed by tall brick walls. It was home to as many as 7,000 people, vast temple complexes, and an imposing stone rampart visible from miles away. Today the hillside is home to a mystery.

No pillars or high walls mark the ruins of the palace and temples that once stood—just stone foundations half-covered by dry grass. Some of the city’s gates still stand, guarded by statues of lions, sphinxes, and an axe-wielding god. But much is gone. The mud-brick walls have crumbled over the centuries; floods and snowmelt have eroded the original hillside, sending buildings full of clay tablets cascading down the slopes. Fainter still are the clues that might explain what happened to the powerful Hittite people—a lost empire that researchers are now beginning to understand with greater clarity.

The disappearance of the Hittites, around 1180 B.C., was a vanishing act with few parallels in history. For at least 450 years, the Hittites controlled much of modern-day Türkiye and beyond—from close to the shores of the Black Sea to the rivers of Mesopotamia and the waters of the Mediterranean. They built sophisticated cities, impressive temples, and an elaborate palace in the rugged countryside of Anatolia. They authored massive archives of cuneiform tablets containing numerous ancient languages and sacred rituals. Their kings benefited from trade routes that reached far beyond the Hittite homeland.Their armies once even penetrated deep into Mesopotamia. Their tangle with Egypt’s Ramses the Great at the Battle of Kadesh resulted in the world’s first peace treaty.

(3,200-year-old trees reveal the collapse of an ancient empire.)

“They were able to fight the Egyptians, and the Babylonians and Assyrians had to treat them as equals,” said Andreas Schachner of the German Archaeological Institute, which has been carrying out digs at the Hattuşa site for nearly a century. Yet “the Egyptians, the Assyrians—they were all part of historical memory. The Hittites were extinguished completely.”

Scholars didn’t register the Hittites’ existence until 3,000 years later, when carvings at ancient Egyptian temples and diplomatic correspondence discovered on clay tablets set off an international hunt for the location of their capital. Little remained at the suspected site besides monumental foundations, but digs there in the early 1900s unearthed a trove of clay cuneiform tablets confirming suspicions that Hattuşa was the lost Hittite capital.

From what they’ve continued to unearth at Hattuşa—a once vibrant center of commerce, culture, and conquest—researchers have compiled an eloquent record of life in the empire. They have assembled details on everything from royal squabbles and religious ceremonies to the proper punishment for killing a dog. Yet the causes for the empire’s collapse remain mysterious. How did the mighty Hittites vanish without a trace—and what can their sudden end teach us today?

Between early Juneand late October, Schachner spends seven days a week crisscrossing Hattuşa and overseeing a team of Turkish and German archaeologists, as well as scores of local workers. He traverses the city’s hills in a battered passenger van, his black dog, Nox, routinely at his side. As director of the German Archaeological Institute’s excavations, he’s been making sense of the site’s jumbled ruins since 2006. “Nothing is in its original place,” Schachner said with a sigh. “There’s so much destruction.”

One day not long ago, I joined him at the city’s Great Temple complex, a hub of ritual spaces, courtyards, storerooms, and secret chambers not far from what were Hattuşa’s northern gates. I followed him as he wound his way through waist-high stone blocks, gesturing upward now and again to refer to the plastered and possibly painted walls that would have towered 30 feet above our heads. He took me to a space once considered the center of the Hittite universe: the Great Temple, dedicated to the storm god Tarhunna and his partner, the sun goddess of Arinna. Foundations surrounding the temple preserve the outlines of 80 storerooms that previously contained vessels full of wine, water, and grain. Researchers have discovered inventories hinting at the riches stored in the temple’s treasury. “When the king came back from a campaign, all the booty was for the storm god,” Schachner told me. “He would have brought it here.”

One question that Schachner hopes to resolve is why the Hittites situated their capital here. There are worse places than central Anatolia to base an empire, but not many. Halfway between the Black Sea and the deserts of Syria, Hattuşa sits in a land of unlikely extremes. Freshwater springs are abundant in the rocky, virtually unfarmable mountains nearby. The region’s few plains, on the other hand, are bone-dry most of the year—unless they’re submerged by seasonal floods.

Close reading of Hittite texts, combined with environmental data, shows that droughts gripped the region every few decades, regularly pushing populations to the brink of starvation and beyond. Archaeologist Bülent Genç, who works with Schachner at Hattuşa, frames the mystery of why the city was built here with bemused admiration. “Considering the climate and surroundings, it’s mind-blowing that they had all this here,” said Genç, who teaches at Türkiye’s Mardin Artuklu University. “The real question is, how did they build an empire in the middle of this central Anatolian hell?”

The answer: a combination of resilience, adaptation, and planning. For the centuries that they reigned, the lords of Hattuşa managed to squeeze just a little more out of the land than anyone before or since. Based on what we know of herding practices—and the myriad animal bones found at Hattuşa—Schachner thinks the surrounding hills supported tens of thousands of sheep and goats, providing a four-footed alternative to the irrigation-dependent farms that supported Egypt and Mesopotamia.

To supply water for industrial and agricultural uses, the Hittites cut storage ponds into Hattuşa’s hillsides. Dug into clay soil to be filled by groundwater, some were longer than an Olympic swimming pool and up to 26 feet deep. Immense, airtight underground pits, meanwhile, contained enough grain to feed their animals in periods of drought.

All of this infrastructure was surrounded by strong walls that ran for an astonishing four miles along the city perimeter, engineered to contend with the hilly terrain’s steep slopes and deep ravines. Between 2003 and 2006, a 71-yard-long segment of it was reconstructed using only materials that would have been available to the Hittites, including wood, rock, and 3,000 tons of mud brick. Based on this experiment, researchers calculated that building just a half mile of wall would have taken a thousand men a year, a stunning feat of logistics.

Touring the site with Schachner, I rode along as he piloted his van up a twisting, one-lane road to reach Hattuşa’s highest spot. Here, the city’s most impressive building project survives: Yerkapı, an elongated rampart standing 130 feet high and 820 feet long. The white stone embankment features a narrow gate decorated with sphinx statues. Adding to its imposing visual impact, a portion of the city’s protective wall ran across the top.

On a clear day this monumental structure is visible from 12 miles away, gleaming white amid the green and gray mountaintops. “Imagine the ambassador of Babylonia, who’s seen everything,” said Schachner, “and then he turns this corner and sees this building that’s as spectacular as anything in Mesopotamia or Egypt. I’ve seen a lot of sites and can’t think of any that are as spectacular from a long way away as this one. This is how they executed control over the landscape.”

Amazingly, Hattuşa isstill yielding new discoveries. The day after my trip up the mountain with Schachner, I returned to the summit to meet Genç at Yerkapı and found him at the mouth of a tunnel that passes underneath the rampart. He stood in an arched passageway that’s about nine feet tall, 230 feet long, and wide enough to accommodate two people walking side by side.

As I entered the unlit tunnel, I became acutely aware of the hundreds of tons of dirt and rock above our heads. Genç, the grandson of a stonemason, wasn’t worried. “This all interconnects, like a tapestry made of stone,” he said, gesturing to the tunnel walls. “It takes really fine masons to make this.”

Halfway down the passageway, we stopped. Bending low, Genç showed me a pinkish, palm-size painting on the stone wall—a symbol, one of 249 that he discovered in the tunnel in 2022. With each glyph representing a word, the symbols had somehow gone unnoticed by the hundreds of archaeologists—and hundreds of thousands of curious tourists—who have passed through the tunnel since it was rediscovered in 1834.

Since Genç’s find, made with the light of his cell phone, Schachner has worked with imaging specialists to scan the tunnel’s interior, creating a 3D model that might help scientists fathom the symbols’ significance. For example, some marks appear in threes, like the glyphs for “mountain” and “path” and the symbol representing the holy mountain Tudhaliya, as well as the god by the same name. “Maybe it’s meant to say ‘the path through Mount Tudhaliya,’ ” Schachner said.

Far from the tunnel, symbols on a very different wall have provided critical information on the reach and power of the Hittites. When archaeologists in Egypt uncovered the funeral temple of Pharaoh Ramses II—also known as Ramses the Great—they found references to a battle that remains perhaps the Hittites’ most enduring contribution to history.

In his temple complex along the Nile River, Ramses, one of Egypt’s strongest rulers, documented the most memorable moments of his reign, including his 1274 B.C. battle with the forces of Hittite king Muwatallis II at Kadesh, an ancient city not far from modern-day Damascus. A floor-to-ceiling relief depicts the pharaoh’s heroics in the face of what he claimed were nearly 50,000 Hittite warriors. Egyptian and Hittite chariots wheel and charge as a larger-than-life Ramses surveys the bloody chaos.

(The Hittites' fast war chariots threatened mighty Egypt.)

Today many historians consider the Battle of Kadesh the biggest chariot battle ever fought. Rather than a resounding victory for Ramses, though, the clash was probably more of a stalemate: In the aftermath, the frontier separating the two empires barely shifted.

Relations between the two powers remained unresolved for 15 years, until Ramses and Muwatallis’s successor worked out the world’s oldest known parity treaty. Inscribed on tablets of silver, with copies made in clay, the 1259 B.C. accord promised mutual assistance against invaders and “a good peace and a good fraternity between the land of Egypt and the land of Hatti forever.”

The agreement marked a pivotal shift in the annals of statecraft. “Up until that moment, the rule was winner take all. Peace treaties were the winner dictating to the losers,” Schachner pointed out. “The Hittites and the Egyptians decided not to continue that way.” The Treaty of Kadesh describes the two rulers as equals and peace as an end in itself. It’s the beginning of modern diplomacy—one reason a copy of the agreement hangs at the United Nations headquarters in New York City. (A fragmented clay original, found at Hattuşa in 1906, is on display at the Istanbul Airport Museum.)

Diplomacy and religion were crucial tools for the Hittites, who referred to their empire as the Land of a Thousand Gods. When they conquered or took control of a group of people, they permitted the subjugated to keep their religious practices. Rather than wiping out local deities, they folded them into the Hittite Empire and pantheon. Holy statues from temples, thought to embody the gods themselves, were transported to Hattuşa’s temple district and worshipped there the way they were at home.

(These pharaohs' private letters expose how politics worked 3,300 years ago.)

Temple archives record the problems with this approach, like gods who didn’t speak Hittite. In one example, after a new god was brought from the island of Lesbos, the Hittites realized that no one knew how to talk to it. A sheep was sacrificed, and its innards were examined to determine if the new god could accept being worshipped Hittite style (yes, was the answer discerned in the sheep’s intestines). “They didn’t want to anger the gods,” Willemijn Waal, a Hittitologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told me. “But at the same time, they’re very pragmatic. It’s kind of adorable.”

It was also a key to their success. “They were able to bring people together not by brutal despotism but by persuasion, using religion and beliefs,” Schachner said. “That is unique. That is what makes them so special.”

What we know about the Hittites is, by the standards of ancient history, incredibly new. Hittite writing wasn’t unlocked until 1915, when a linguist in Prague named Bedřich Hrozný realized that the unearthed tablets were written in an Indo-European language—the earliest known example of a family that today includes everything from English to Sanskrit. Over the past century, more than 30,000 remnants of clay tablets have been recovered from Hattuşa and other Hittite cities. More are found every year. That constant flow of brand-new information makes Hittitology one of the most dynamic, fast-moving fields of ancient history.

Late one afternoon, I found Daniel Schwemer, a researcher from Germany’s University of Würzburg, seated at a table in the German Archaeological Institute’s “dig house” in Boğazkale, the village next to Hattuşa’s ruins. Schwemer is part of a small community of scholars who specialize in reading and translating Hittite texts. Every autumn he comes to Hattuşa to see what’s been found during the summer’s excavations. “It’s a bit like unpacking Christmas presents,” Schwemer said. “You really never know what you’ll get.”

Each new find has the potential to change what we know about Bronze Age empires. It’s “an area where history is still in the process of being written,” Schwemer said. “Documents are coming out of the ground nobody has seen for thousands of years.”

Of course, answers to a question at the heart of Hittite research remain elusive: What happened to them? Theories abound, from political unrest to climate change, but a lone explanation seems unlikely to be found. “There’s no single reason why such a complex society disintegrates and completely disappears from history,” Schachner said. Instead, a “perfect storm” of factors probably pushed the Hittites to the limits and then beyond.

Raiders were a constant threat, for example. Tribes known as the Kaska living along the Black Sea coast show up in tablets, destroying temples and desecrating statues before dividing up “the priests, the holy priests, the priestesses, the anointed ones, the musicians, the singers, the cooks, the bakers, the plowmen, and the gardeners, and [making] them their servants.”

Natural disasters, too, strained the Hittite Empire from time to time. Recent finds from a site called Şapinuva suggest powerful earthquakes regularly rocked the Hittite heartland. About 40 miles northeast of Hattușa, at Şapinuva’s palace and temple complex, excavations revealed walls and floors that rippled like waves. Archaeologists discovered buildings and storehouses consumed in a huge fire—all clues the city was hit by a devastating quake.

The Hittites successfully handled these and different challenges for years—until, suddenly, they didn’t. By about 1250 B.C., the tablets begin to show the strains of the empire’s final century. Palace infighting and royal assassination attempts grew rampant, making it hard for Hattuşa’s leaders to maintain control over their subjects. Epidemic diseases were a problem too: The tablets contain prayers to ward off plagues. And changes in language and writing styles in the empire’s final decades may be signs of social strife or upheaval, signs their multiethnic state was under strain.

The latest findings suggest climate change and a series of natural disasters helped accelerate the empire’s decline. In a 2023 study, researchers analyzed preserved wood recovered from Gordion, a city on the western outskirts of the Hittite Empire. By measuring tree rings, they could tell nearby forests were unusually stressed between 1198 and 1196 B.C., evidence of a punishing, three-year drought right around the time the Hittite Empire was ending.

The drought may have sparked famine. Archaeologists found empty grain depots at Hattuşa, Şapinuva, and other abandoned Hittite cities. Letters reflect the desperation of Hittite kings, who begged foreign leaders to send barley and wheat as “a matter of life and death.” And invaders referred to as Sea Peoples in Egyptian chronicles caused chaos that rippled all across the Mediterranean, weakening old alliances and prompting mass migrations. “That was the salt and pepper on the dish,” said Genç.

Around 1180 B.C., the Hittites methodically abandoned their capital. There are no signs of battle or conquest; no mass graves, no toppled towers or buildings. Temple storehouses full of gold and silver vessels, gilded spears, and booty from successful military campaigns—elaborately described in festival instructions and inventory lists but missing today—must have been packed up and evacuated.

Afterward, the city burned. But in a final irony, the flames that destroyed Hattuşa preserved its story: Too heavy to move from their archives, the thousands of clay tablets the Hittites amassed over the course of roughly four centuries were left behind. Fire baked them into hard bricks, helping them survive the ensuing centuries intact. “The advantage—for us—is that all these clay tablets were left behind when everyone fled the capital,” Schwemer said. “What remained was the paperwork.”

Until a tablet emerges inscribed with an account of Hattuşa’s last days, the mystery abides. The Hittites managed to adapt to a harsh environment and grow into a mighty empire despite their surroundings, until circumstances beyond their control upset their delicate balancing act. The Hittites’ collapse, and their recent rediscovery, is a testament to the importance of resilience—and good recordkeeping.

102,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/impact/article/bertie-gregory-explorer-story,"The wildlife filmmaker brings his audience along for every insightful and amusing moment of his storytelling

As Bertie Gregory remembers it, the seeds of his passion might have been sown in the fields of English farmers, near his childhood home, where an endless wildlife drama unfolded.

He recalls spending countless hours exploring, often missing family gatherings while wandering through stories written in nature. This deep fascination, and a need for an explanation to where he disappeared, eventually led him to photography.

“I found that if I took pictures of these animals I was obsessed with, it was a great way to channel my passion. I also realized photography was a great way of getting other people excited about the natural world.”

Now, as a renowned wildlife filmmaker, photographer and presenter, theNational Geographic Explorerand2025 Rolex National Geographic Explorer of the Yearalongside fellow ExplorerPablo “Popi” Garcia Borborogluhas taken viewers with him through his candid and engaging storytelling for over a decade.

For his most recent project, he’ll leadNational Geographic’s three-part documentary series, “Secrets of the Penguins,” premiering on National Geographic Channel on April 20 and available on Disney+ on April 21.

Executive-produced by National Geographic Explorer at Large and award-winning filmmakerJames Cameron, and featuring fellow Explorer, scientist and conservationistBorboroglu, the series unveils thefascinating behaviorsof penguins, from emperor penguins’ revelatory bonds of friendship to the gritty resolve of gentoos and rockhoppers and the astonishing ingenuity of the migrant penguins that reached deserts and far beyond. Through below zero temperatures, hurricane-like winds and encounters with apex predators,these birdsshow remarkablesurvival techniques. Gregory has been along to witness it all.

“I spend my entire life trying to sneak up on shy animals,” Gregory narrates in the series trailer. “These penguins are definitely different.”

It’s far from his first time filming in extreme conditions, with eight Antarctic expeditions under his belt. In 2021, he led a team to Antarctica’s Elephant Island. The remote location, infamous for theEndurance’s tragic fate, was rumored to host a massive gathering offin whales. The species was decimated during the whaling era, but Gregory and his team uncovered a story of possibility.

After six weeks of brutal weather — with only six days suitable for filming (even calm days saw 25-knot winds) — they documented an unprecedented sight:300 fin whales, the largest gathering ever filmed, feeding on krill within a few football fields expanse. “This particular day, all I could see on the horizon were just hundreds of cannons going off. It looked like an old sea battle, and it was the 20-foot-high blows of the whales,” Gregory recalls.

“Towering blows that were backlit by the rising sun. The horizon was just like party poppers.”

The resurgence is a testament to the 1980s whaling moratorium, explains Gregory, and offers a rare story of hope. New science has underscored whales’ vital role incarbon sequestration, with a single whale equaling 30,000 trees.

“It’s perfectly possible that some of the whales I was diving with were alive when our species was trying to hunt them to extinction,” says Gregory. “Everywhere wildlife is on the back foot but with these fin whales it’s one of the only places in the world where it hasn’t been better in 100 years. The sighting was caught on camera for National Geographic’s “Epic Adventures with Bertie Gregory.”

Gregory is clear on his perspective about facing danger in his work: “It’s not about being reckless or an adrenaline junkie, it’s just about expanding your comfort zone.” Yes, he’s dived alongside one of the biggest schools ofhammerhead sharksever recorded, and stood feet away frompacks of wolves, but it’s not the animals he’s worried about.

“On a shoot the most dangerous species we encounter is always humans. Whether directly dangerous or a human misinterpreting wild animal behavior and putting us and the animal in a difficult situation. You’ve got to be so unlucky to have an unsolicited attack by a wild animal.”

“Controlled suffering” is how he describes wildlife filmmaking. “You just need to be good at being cold and miserable,” and he emphasizes the value of failure. “The failures are just as important as the successes. Sometimes we just fail and we make a show about that.”

This resilience, he believes, was partly honed through his family’s love of water sports. “I think when you spend the amount of time I did bobbing up and down on a surfboard off the coast of Cornwall, being cold and having waves break on your head, you gain an appreciation for the outdoors.”

Early photography eventually led Gregory to National Geographic photographerSteve Winter,who offered him an assistant role. At 20, Gregory joined Winter documenting leopards in South Africa, Mumbai and Sri Lanka which resulted in aNat Geo WILD special.

Gregory recalls that at the time, Winter flashed his iconic photo of amountain lionin front of the Hollywood sign to him one night, before it was published. It further fueled his interest in urban wildlife, particularly the peregrine falcon, his favorite animal.

He sees the potential of urban wildlife as a way to reconnect people with nature. “I discovered that if you look hard enough, you can have a wildlife experience in a city that’s just as wild as anywhere else.”

In 2015, Gregory became an Explorer. His 16-part online wildlife series, National Geographic’s first-ever of its kind, documented elusive coastal wolves of Vancouver Island. He went on to work for the BBC’s Natural History Unit, shooting for David Attenborough’s “Seven Worlds, One Planet,” and later returned to produce and host subsequent seasons of the online series before developing the streaming shows “Epic Adventures with Bertie Gregory,” and “Animals up Close with Bertie Gregory.”

The award-winning filmmaker is motivated by storytelling’s conservation impact. Hisdrone imagery of batsand their habitat loss in Zambia’s Kasanka National Park, for example, was used in courts to push back against destructive agriculture projects.

“One thing I’m really keen on now is making sure that every project, in addition to contributing towards the general public’s appreciation for nature and their awareness of environmental issues, also has some quantifiable impact alongside that,” says Gregory.

He hopes his work entertains and inspires, encouraging viewers to engage with and protect nature.

“Wildlife will come back on an unbelievable scale if you give it the chance, and that’s great news for wildlife and great news for us as well.”

103,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/dinosaur-fossils-amateur-paleontologists-france,"The French countryside is rich in fossilized eggs, footprints, and bones. A battle is raging over who is allowed to hunt for them.

One scorching daylast September, Annie Méchin crouched over a slab of red clay on a remote patch of farmland near Marseille, on France’s Mediterranean coast. Méchin was scraping away at the clay when she unearthed what looked like a tiny bone fragment. Sensing the familiar jolt of adrenaline that surged anytime she came across a fossil, she called out to her husband, Patrick, who was digging nearby. Carefully, the two amateur paleontologists, both retired and in their 60s, cleared the surface area, dug a small trench around the bone, and fashioned a plaster mold for the scientific record.

By the time night fell, the Méchins had two more molds and a growing sense of excitement that they might be onto something big. It was “a consecration of the work we do,” says Patrick. Indeed, leading experts would soon tout the potential significance of their find. But the discovery came at a tricky time for paleontology in France, where there are efforts to keep the couple—and all other amateurs—out of the digging game.

Once simmering, the debate over who gets to hunt for dinosaur fossils has become a roiling fight over credentials. On one side: French officials and scientists fed up with looting and an international black market where fossils can fetch top dollar. On the other: hobbyists working with professionals to protect and catalog the country’s geologic patrimony, filling museums with specimens that only hordes of enthusiasts could possibly collect. Each side accuses the other of being anti-science. Both sides have evidence to back themselves up. And it’s a conflict that is becoming only more urgent as the country’s paleontological wealth is increasingly understood.

France was oncefilled with dinosaurs. Today it has one of the most extensive fossil records in Europe, ranging from the late Triassic period to the late Cretaceous, roughly 200 million to 75 million years ago. Fossils were first discovered in the country in the 18th century, but interest in paleontology was turbocharged in the 1950s, when researchers found a large cache of dinosaur eggs in the stony southern foothills of Montagne Sainte-Victoire.



A raft of scientific and newspaper articles followed, and within months people swarmed the area around the city of Aix-en-Provence (soon nicknamed Eggs-en-Provence) in search of their own scaly orb, roughly the size and shape of a football. A clandestine market emerged. A single specimen might sell for a few thousand francs, the equivalent of several hundred euros today. In response, authorities cracked down and in 1994 turned Sainte-Victoire into a nature reserve. But dinosaur eggs kept cropping up. Between 2000 and 2004, researchers in Aix uncovered 500 or so at a plot that would become a Monoprix retail store and more than 400 eggs were found underneath the Grand Théâtre de Provence.

Professional paleontologists, many busy with research, were unable to constantly look for new fossils; amateurs increasingly filled the void. In the 1980s, the Méchins dug up a massive jawbone of an abelisaurid, a dinosaur that until then had only been found in South America. In 2022, an amateur digger discovered what turned out to be a nearly complete titanosaur in a wooded area by the town of Cruzy in southern France.

Many of those hobbyists, including the Méchins, follow paleontological methods when they dig and then share their discoveries with the scientific community. A scholarly paper published last year described the discovery of several hundred noteworthy fossils from the Ordovician period, some 470 million years ago; their finds quickly became the subject of an academic study among scientists at the University of Lausanne, in Switzerland. But there’s big money to be made in the fossil trade, and some diggers are less scrupulous.

Thierry Tortosa, curator and paleontologist at the Sainte-Victoire National Nature Reserve, has helped a few hobbyists authenticate their finds, only to discover later that the items were sold on the black market. A specialist in vertebrates of the Upper Cretaceous period, he says he is aware of private collections that have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but there are surely some that have sold for much more.

In November 2024, anApatosaurusskeleton found in Wyoming was sold to an anonymous bidder for six million dollars at an auction in a Paris suburb. In 2023, a T. rex known as Trinity was sold in Zurich for $5.4 million. Museums can’t afford these price tags. Even if they could, purchasing the finds “would open a Pandora’s box,” Tortosa says. “If we start buying fossils, everyone will say, Well, we won’t give it away because someone will buy it.”

More often, fossils disappear from the public record with much less fanfare than a public auction. One particularly valuable site in Roquefort-la-Bédoule, on France’s southern coast, has been repeatedly pillaged by looters. “It’s a ruin now,” laments Tortosa. Ninety percent of private collections, he says, are sold, lost to fire, or simply abandoned. In one report, the French National Council for the Protection of Nature found France’s geologic patrimony had been “heavily impacted by the collection of fossils.”

In Normandy, the situation is especially tense. For centuries, locals have been collecting 160-million-year-old, Jurassic-period fossils, ammonites, and other treasures from the beaches below the sheer cliffs of Calvados, where some of the first dinosaur remains in France were found. For the time being, they still can. But the French government has plans to transform the area into a 23-mile nature reserve, a measure designed in part to place restrictions on who is allowed to dig at the site.

If the proposed regulations are enacted, anyone caught collecting fossils without permission could incur a 750-euro fine. Karine Boutillier, director of the local natural history museum, Paleospace, has described the government’s efforts as “the assassination of paleontology in Normandy.” In protest, her team placed red flags on every dinosaur specimen that had been collected by an amateur. Virtually the entire collection, some 27,000 fossils, was flagged.

Laurent Puglisi, a doctor from Paris and an ardent amateur collector himself, argues that the Calvados cliffs represent a unique challenge. “It’s a seafront area, so if the fossils aren’t collected right away, they’ll be turned into sand in a matter of hours,” he fumes. “Collecting them is preserving them.” Puglisi has been spearheading an effort to persuade local and national authorities to relent, to little effect so far.

Éric Buffetaut, a paleontologist at France’s National Center for Scientific Research, echoes Puglisi’s concerns. “If we prevent amateurs from collecting fossils, well, there won’t be any new fossils.” Already, he says, parts of Provence have become a “research wasteland” because of overly strict regulations.

Meanwhile, theMéchinshave been fortunate. Their discovery in Provence, near Marseille, last September took place on a tract of private land whose owner had given them permission to continue their research. After their initial find, the couple returned to the site four times and eventually uncovered several more fossils belonging to the same dinosaur. The collection of rust-colored bones could answer a mystery that has been bubbling in French paleontological circles for more than 30 years.

In the late 1980s, the Méchins had discovered a similar set of bones in another region of Provence. Buffetaut studied the fossils and concluded that they belonged to a raptor with a hooked talon, perhaps a few feet tall, that lived at the tail end of the Cretaceous period, just a few million years before dinosaurs went extinct, roughly 66 million years ago. Buffetaut co-authored a paper about the discovery and declared a new raptor species, naming itVariraptor mechinorumin honor of the Méchins.

Soon a team of scientists from Paris disputed the new designation, claiming the bones likely belonged to a different raptor species, andVariraptor mechinorumhas been shrouded in ambiguity ever since. The Méchins’ new find could provide the missing pieces to help resolve the mystery, says Tortosa, who has examined the discovery. Yet, despite his collaboration with amateurs, Tortosa favors better enforcement of existing rules over who is authorized to dig. “Regulation doesn’t necessarily mean prohibition,” he says. But France also shouldn’t be a Wild West, where anything goes, he adds.

One day recently, the Méchins opened the door to a small room in an undisclosed location that houses their collection, the fruits of four decades of digging. Passing shelves that hold crocodile and alligator craniums, a giant turtle carapace, dozens of dinosaur teeth, anAnkylosauruspelvis, and numerous fragments ofTitanosaurus,Patrick and Annie paused next to a table covered by a half dozen fossils.

No entire skeleton ofVariraptor mechinorumhas ever been found, but the specimens laid out on the table—that included a tibia, a piece of a cranium, teeth, an arm fragment, and portions of a vertebra—represented perhaps the most complete collection to date.

“We’re not religious,” said Patrick, as he looked around the room. “But this is like our church.”

104,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/titanic-wreck-3d-scanning-mapping,"Fresh advances in 3D scanning technology are making it possible to explore some of the hardest-to-reach and most fragile sites on Earth.

Last year, Parks Stephensonstood next to theTitanicand walked slowly around it, gazing up at the massive ship. He paused to look inside one of the boiler rooms and at the position of the controls on the engines. He noticed the number 401, the ship’s ID, etched on the propeller blades. Rusticles hung from the steel shell. Twisted metal and personal trinkets from those long dead littered the ground.

Stephenson, a retired naval officer andTitanichistorian, wasn’t 12,500 feet below the surface of the North Atlantic, of course. He was in London, inspecting the ship’s digital twin: a one-for-one computer model made possible by advances in remote 3D scanning and mapping technology. The model is so densely detailed, a video rendering of it can be projected to life-size in a warehouse, where researchers can walk alongside it and zoom in and out on individual features, like a steam valve from the boiler room, which the scan revealed was left open, possibly to keep an emergency generator running as the ship sank. TheTitanictwin adds to a growing list of similar models made of archaeological and cultural sites around the world that both preserve these fragile places and provide a new means of exploring them.

Stephenson has seen the actualTitanicwreck twice since his first dive in 2005, but he didn’t catch so many details on his trips. “You can only see what’s immediately in front of you,” he says of peering through a submersible’s roughly six-inch viewport and camera views. “It’s like being in a dark room and you have a flashlight that’s not very powerful.” The digital twin, on the other hand, gave him an unobstructed, 360-degree view of every gnarled nook and cranny.

(What we’ve learned—and lost—since the Titanic wreck was found.)

The scan of the storied ship was carried out over three weeks in 2022 by Magellan, a deep-sea mapping company based in the Channel Islands.Titanic: The Digital Resurrection,a new National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+, tells the story of the effort. It is the largest underwater 3D scan ever made, amounting to 16 terabytes of data (equivalent to the hard drive footprint of six million e-books). To create it, two remote-operated robots romantically named Romeo and Juliet traveled down to the wreck and systematically canvassed the site, taking some 715,000 photos and millions of laser measurements.

For Stephenson, the quality of detail in the scan opens new lines of inquiry into the sinking of theTitanic.The ship lies broken in two pieces, with the bow and stern about 2,600 feet apart. The hull descended in a straight line and is largely still intact—the scan shows it neatly wedged into the ocean floor. The stern, on the other hand, is shattered, and researchers have never been able to definitively say how that happened. When Stephenson looked at the scan, though, he could immediately envision the back half of the ship spiraling as it sank and disintegrating into rubble. “At a first glance,” he says, “it just made sense.”

In the past, a full, grand scale of the wreck could be depicted only through artistic renditions or photomosaics created by humans. Neither method conveyed precise verisimilitude. The machine-run 3D model, however, is exact. “As soon as I saw theTitanicdigital twin images,” Stephenson says, “I could tell. Number one, I’d never seenTitaniclike this before. And number two, it felt right.”

(Inside theTitanicwreck's lucrative tourism industry.)

The quest to createexact models for more accessible surveying started over a century ago. The technology that makes digital twinning possible dates back to at least 1858, when a German engineer named Albrecht Meydenbauer was tasked with surveying a church and nearly fell to his death while measuring the facade. To avoid another dangerous climb, he worked out a way to mathematically calculate the measurements of large objects from photos—a technique he called photogrammetry. Today photogrammetry combined with lidar, which uses lasers to measure distances, as well as advanced computing power, produces models that can accurately replicate the most minute details of enormous structures likeMount Rushmoreor the aesthetic proportions ofMichelangelo’s “David.”

The Italian Renaissance master’s sculpture was one of the first major artifacts to be digitally modeled, in 2000, by Stanford University. Though not as massive as theTitanic,the statue’s relatively large size—17 feet tall and 12,500 pounds—and finely chiseled details made it a good test for how accurately 3D technology might reproduce objects on a grand scale. Today the tech is so precise that in 2020 a team at the University of Florence produced a 3D-printed copy, accurate down to David’s resolute expression and every defect of the original stone.

People travel to see masterpieces of human creativity because they want to feel the presence of something awesome or genius. But too much of our presence can destroy places that are irreplaceable. Hundreds have visited theTitanic,most of them at enormous expense, including five on the ill-fatedTitansubmersible. These explorers are the source of significant damage suffered by the wreck; human-piloted submersibles have inadvertently stripped a mast and gashed the bow.

Beyond tourism, sites may be unpredictably damaged by natural disasters, climate change, or war. In 2019, 3D documentation company CyArk created models of Nigeria’s Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove, just before the sculpture-laden forest shrines were destroyed in a flood. Chance Coughenour, a program manager for Google Arts&Culture, which supported CyArk in these efforts and hosts these models online, hopes the shrines can be rebuilt from the scans. Coughenour’s group supported similar efforts to create digital twins of a cathedral and a historic government landmark in Ukraine that are nowdamaged by the war.

On an even grander scale, digital twins can be made of not only buildings, statues, and shipwrecks but also entire cities—living or dead. Allison Emmerson, an archaeologist at Tulane University, is making a digital twin of parts of Pompeii, a famously fragile site where she’s spent the past 16 years digging through layers of soil to uncover the city’s earliest history. Emmerson says digital twinning is the biggest leap forward for archaeology since photography. “Our process is inherently destructive,” she says of excavating a site. “We can never redo it. We can dig the site once. And so the focus in modern archaeology has been on recording as well as we possibly can.”

(Pompeii still has many secrets to uncover—but should we keep digging?)

Her team’s twin of a block in the southeast of the city was made with just a few handheld cameras. The model allows them to visualize the site with the walls of a room taken away, or a roof added, or how the land looked before the building was constructed. They can call up the model back in the lab and continue conversations that previously would happen only in the field. Emmerson’s work has revealed how one building at the site was both a restaurant and a workshop where people manufactured reed baskets and mats—details that help her understand the city’s economy and the daily life of its working class.

For her part,Emmerson plans to make her model of Pompeii and the accompanying findings available to the public, avoiding a common outcome for these projects. Because digital twins are expensive to create, many ambitious projects end up locked way in the private archives of universities or governments. “I did not want the model to live on a team member’s laptop,” she says.

While Magellan has not announced any plans to make itsTitanicscans free to the public, the documentary itself shows what’s possible. Much of the existing research on the shipwreck has been conducted by private expeditions that guard findings, an ongoing source of concern for scientists and citizen enthusiasts alike. Stephenson remains concerned the wreck is not being treated as an archaeological site. “It’s one of the most famous sites in the world, and we don’t even have the basic baseline information needed to establish what’s there at any particular time, because you’ve had different explorers who don’t share information,” he says. The digital twin has the potential to allow more visitors to experience it in a less destructive and more collaborative way.

It’s unlikely people will stop going to theTitanicwreck site. Its draw has proven irresistible for those with enough money and motivation. In 2001, for example, a couple exchanged vows crouched in a submersible perched on the bow. A digital twin “certainly doesn’t replace sitting on the deck of theTitanic,”says Robert Ballard, an oceanographer and National Geographic Explorer at Large who discovered the wreck in 1985 along with Jean-Louis Michel. But he thinks it will help preserve the wreck. For those who cannot resist going themselves, he offers two warnings: “Don’t touch it. Don’t get married on it.”

(Despite the warning ‘Iceberg, Right Ahead!’ the Titanic was doomed.)

105,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/northern-forest-canoe-trail-ancient-native-waterway,"A season on the Northern Forest Canoe Trail—stretching from the Adirondacks to northern Maine—reveals fresh possibilities for an ancient route.

The rain came downin sheets, roiling the surface of Fourth Lake, an oblong crescent in the heart of New York’sAdirondack Mountainsand the largest of eight lakes in the Fulton chain. I laid my paddle on my knees and looked around. Our small flotilla of canoes and kayaks, containing a dozen or so paddlers, was spread out over a half mile, though the downpour obscured many of my companions. We were hustling toward the closest takeout, a mile away on Fifth Lake.

Only a few hours earlier, I had shoved off from the tiny hamlet of Old Forge, in upstate New York, pushing east with a group of Native American paddlers along a portion of an ancient route that runs for 740 miles to Maine. The Northern Forest Canoe Trail (NFCT) is made up of a network of more than 80 lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams that snake from Old Forge across the heart of the Northeast, throughVermont,Québec, andNew Hampshire, before finally ending with more than 300 miles of travel deep in the woods ofMaine. Unlike a lot of canoe trips, this is not a strictly downstream affair but an overland journey too. Many of these waterways are not connected, and so extensive portaging—of one’s canoe, camping gear, and food—is mandatory.

Lucky for us, when we hauled the boats out at Fifth Lake, our first carry was short, just a half mile, and a gas station along the way offered a dry spot to regroup. We left our canoes in a corner of the parking lot. Most of the team huddled inside around hot drinks, while a few smoked cigarettes under an awning out front. Spirits were not high. But there was no easy way to bail.

In 2000 a group of paddlers from New England established this long stretch of waterways as the NFCT and began to formally map it. An eponymous nonprofit has spent the 25 years since helping people of all stripes discover one of North America’s greatest canoeing adventures. Of course, the designation doesn’t mean the waterways are just now being utilized for the first time. The communities within the Haudenosaunee Confederacy and Algonquin people, among others, have plied these waters for millennia. Beginning in the 1600s, the same network of rivers and lakes proved vital toEuropean settlersfor transportation and expansion of the fur-trapping and timber industries. And in the decades after theCivil War, the very beginnings of the American outdoor recreation ethos began to take root in the area. All for one reason: In this part of the world, it’s easier to travel by water than by land.

(See New England’s vibrant fall foliage on an epic canoe trail.)

I’ve lived in New England my whole life, but I’m a mountain guide and had virtually no canoeing experience. Still, when a friend first told me about the NFCT, it felt like a chance to hike theAppalachian Trailin the 1960s: to experience something wild before it was overrun by weekend warriors and “influencers.” Fewer than 300 people have paddled the trail in one go, and while I never planned to join their ranks, over the course of four months, I traversed hundreds of the trail’s miles on trips led by members of several Indigenous nations.

At the gas station, the hot coffee, cigarettes, and energy drinks kicked in, and our spirits began to rebound. The downpour let up just enough for us to talk each other into heading for the first available campsite—a lean-to three miles away on Sixth Lake at a place called Goff Point. “It’s easier to keep going when you don’t have a choice,” someone said with a shrug.

By the time we arrived, the rain had nearly stopped. We started a fire and sat in a circle roasting hot dogs and drying out our drenched gear. The blaze crackled, sending beams of firelight glittering across the now still surface of the darkened lake. On the opposite shore, we could see headlights weaving along Route 28.

Growing up, Jeremiah Pointlearned about how his grandparents survived the residential schools—institutions deployed by the U.S. and Canadian governments that took Indigenous children away from their communities to eradicate their cultures, often by violent and abusive means. He also knew that his parents had survived the Indian Day Schools, another assimilative effort. “My generation is the first to not be under an active policy to assimilate and colonize,” he told me. “People think that it happened a long time ago, and it didn’t.”

(They were taken from their families as children. Can that trauma be healed?)

Point did not know the region’s rivers the way his Akwesasne Mohawk ancestors did. That started to change in 2013, when he paddled on theHudson Riverin New York State as part of the Two Row Wampum Paddle, an event that commemorated the 400-year anniversary of the original treaty between the Haudenosaunee people and the Dutch. Despite it being his first time on a canoe journey, Point felt a strange sense of déjà vu. Every time he encountered somebody new—whether from the Cayuga, Seneca, or Oneida nations—he had a sense as though they’d met before. The campsites they stopped at along the Hudson’s banks felt like home. “It’s in our DNA,” an elder told him. “Our ancestors did this trip. They were here for thousands of years. That’s why the monarch butterfly can go from Canada to Mexico over multiple generations. They’re not taught that—it’s in their blood.”

On our trip, Point shared an 18-foot canoe with Ionawiienhawi Sargent, an Akwesasne Mohawk artist on their first canoe journey. Each morning, the pair were the first out of their tents, prepping breakfast and starting the long process of breaking down camp. Ionawiienhawi shared Point’s sense of unity on the water. “It’s a place of connection and prayer,” they told me.

Most of our crew, like Neil Benedict, an Oneida welder, were hoping to make the full two-week trip to Vermont. Others, like Lenny Printup and his then 12-year-old son, Thunder, citizens of the Onondaga Nation, were merely tagging along for the long weekend. And some heard about the trip just 30 minutes before our departure; one fellow was so excited to tag along, he nearly forgot to bring his paddle.

“It is wonderful how well wateredthis country is,”Henry David Thoreauwrote inThe Maine Woods,which was published in 1864 and contains chronicles of three canoe journeys through the Northern Forest, on some of the same passageways that now make up the NFCT. “Generally, you may go in any direction in a canoe, by making frequent but not very long portages.”

An understatement if ever there was one. As the Saranac River ran down out of theeastern Adirondacksin New York, just some 20 miles west of Lake Champlain, whitewater gushing through a gorge forced us to pull off the river and start yet another portage. Although most carries on the NFCT are a mile or less and portage wheels take the bite out of many of them, the carries are often the most challenging part of any canoe journey. Trails can get tight and hilly, and navigating roots, rocks, and foliage while lugging your gear takes as much mental fortitude as it does physical endurance.

For nearly the entire day we trudged in the hot sun down Casey Road. It had hardly rained since the first days of our journey, and the river was unusually low. We were forced to follow the road for eight miles, rather than the more typical five, most of the way to Clayburg, a small village in the already small town of Saranac. For the first few miles, the road was nothing more than a narrow gravel track tunneling through a dense emerald patchwork of June leaves. The river faintly rushed somewhere in the distance. We were beat, and what little conversation we could muster tapered off as we labored along, descending into the first stifling heat wave of summer.

Four miles into the march, the road changed to cracked pavement, and a call broke our trance: “Would you like a lemonade?”

To our right, on a sturdy wraparound porch, sat Holly and Lee Plumadore, a cheerful middle-age couple. The walls were adorned with a collection of vintage signs: lee tires; nasa; our happy place. It was the first house we had seen all morning. We would indeed like some lemonade, we said, grateful for the excuse to set down our canoes and get out of the sun.

The Plumadores both had roots in Clayburg. Lee was born and raised there, while Holly’s grandparents called the village home. She found her way back for good once she married Lee, and the couple settled down near the Saranac. Recently, they’d noticed an increase in boaters journeying down their road. “In the last two or three years is when it’s really picked up,” Lee said, noting that the passersby varied from the occasional adventurer to an almost daily parade of people at the height of summer. The couple started offering refreshments; it just seemed like the neighborly thing to do.

“Some people stop; some don’t,” Lee said, nodding toward the road, simmering in the noon heat. “This can be daunting.”

Later that afternoon, while we were still plodding down the road, an NFCT steward and volunteer named Craig Von Bargen pulled up alongside us with a tractor and a wagon long enough to accommodate all our canoes. He shepherded us downriver and deposited us at a campsite he maintains a short distance from the Saranac.

A few days later, when we trudged into the village of Swanton, Vermont, I said goodbye to Point, Ionawiienhawi, and the rest of my companions. I kept paddling, against the current up the Missisquoi River. The lower water allowed me and Clayton Francis, a lone paddler the group had befriended, to make our way up several easy rapids, wading across pools and dragging our canoes behind us with short sections of rope. As the river wound through farm country and the smell of manure filled the air, the effects of the summer’sdroughtbecame obvious: Water levels plunged, and river-bottom rocks, covered in slippery algae, were exposed to foot and canoe alike. Just before the border with Canada, I said farewell to Francis and then quit the river myself.

After several weeksat home, I thought I would return to the NFCT refreshed, ready to take on the last 300-some miles that awaited me in Maine. But the trail’s final miles hold hurdles that have bedeviled paddlers for centuries.

One morning in the summer of 1857, Joe Polis set out across the Mud Pond carry, a nearly two-mile stretch of land connecting Maine’s Umbazooksus Lake to Mud Pond. A guide from the Penobscot Nation, Polis was leading Thoreau and his friend, Ed Hoar. As immortalized inThe Maine Woods,at some point, Polis, hauling the group’s canoe, hustled ahead while the pair of Americans dawdled through the forest. Guideless, Thoreau and Hoar missed a turn and soon found themselves wandering a maze of overgrown logging roads. After reaching Mud Pond, Polis, guessing at what must have happened, doubled back and saved the men from an uncomfortable night lost in the woods.

(These Native American-led tours connect travelers to living history.)

The Mud Pond carry is no less humbling today. It’s far too narrow for portage wheels, so I had to relay my equipment in two loads, turning almost two miles into more than five. It was a theme of theMainestretch of the NFCT, which took me two trips to complete. On my second, frustrated and a little desperate, I enlisted the company of someone with as intimate a knowledge of these waters as there is.

Jason Pardilla is a river guide and elected Penobscot council member—he is also Polis’s great-grandnephew. As I set out on the Allagash River with Pardilla, I found he would rather talk about currents than his ancestors. “I’m related to a bunch of cool Penobscots, but I always feel weird” telling their stories, he said. “I don’t mind being recognized for my skills, but I don’t want to be out there being that guy.” Yet, for Pardilla, reading rivers has always been second nature. “I didn’t realize how much I knew until I started guiding, and other people just didn’t see the things that I saw.”

Pardilla and I were joined by James Eric Francis, Sr., the Penobscot historian, and river guides Jennifer Neptune and Ryan Ranco-Kelley, also members of the Penobscot Nation. Where many tribes faced removal and disconnection from their lands and waters, the Penobscot have held on to their place along theirnamesake riverand continued their legacy of canoe guiding.

“Water is freedom,” Neptune said. “We weren’t removed; we were just pushed onto the islands in our river as our territory shrunk down. But in a way it was perfect because it allowed us that freedom to still have our culture. To get in a canoe and take off. That’s what our people did: We just took off.”

That summer, the Allagash’s water table had been reduced to a trickle by themonths-long drought, and in shallow water a paddle loses its efficiency. To compensate, the river people of the Northeast use longsprucepoles to guide themselves through“skinnywater.”Poling makes upstream travel vastly more efficient, a necessary skillfor a community thathad to think in terms ofround-tripcanoejourneys, not simply downstreamtravel.

Soon after we started down the river, Pardilla stowed his paddle, picked upa 14-foot spruce pole—skinned free of bark and fitted with a copper end cap—stood up, and began easing his canoe around rocks and strainers, downed trees that can be hazardous to boaters. “It’s the original stand-up paddleboard,”he said with a chuckle.

We later portaged around Allagash Falls, and the landscape started to change once again. The frisky brook trout disappeared; the spruce thinned. And then, quite suddenly, there was a paved road running alongside the river: the first we had seen in a hundred miles. As we pushed on, the Allagash unceremoniously emptied us into the Saint John River. That night, finally, it rained. The next morning, with Pardilla, Francis Sr., and Neptune bowing out due to the weather, Ranco-Kelley and I put down an extra cup of coffee before departing for my final day on the water.

The end ofthe Northern Forest Canoe Trail can feel strangely abrupt for all the effort one puts in to get there. We glided down riffles of swift water, the current rushing us across great gravel bars. Then we rounded a corner and spied the “friendship bridge” between Maine and Québec—and just beyond it, the boat ramp at Fort Kent, the eastern terminus of the trail. I might have missed the cobblestone landing altogether if not for our friends standing in the rain waiting for us to complete our journey.

The cumulative fatigue from days spent canoeing against gravity and hauling my boat and gear, sometimes for miles, had taken its toll. Most evenings, I fell asleep shortly after nightfall, and I’d come to savor peanut butter by the spoonful, direct from the jar. At some point during my many trips that summer, I had begun to think of the trail not as a series of twists and turns one might expect from a river but a series of steps. Some long and smooth, some short and steep, but always either rising or falling, fighting the current upstream or flowing downhill. Our path on the NFCT followed the water, and the water flowed according to the shape of the land. As Thoreau wrote inThe Maine Woods,“Wherever there is a channel for water, there is a road for the canoe.”

On the beach, Ranco-Kelley and I paused for a couple of quick photos, then pulled our canoe ashore and drained the rainwater from its belly. We sloshed up the muddy track, past the old Fort Kent blockhouse to the parking lot beyond, carrying our canoe together.

106,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/american-burying-beetle-human-health,"Scientists are studying the American burying beetle's death-defying resilience to benefit human health.

Among the latest contenders in the fight against drug-resistant infections is a striking, black beetle with fiery red spots and orange-tipped antennae. Known for spending much of its life underground, the little-known American burying beetle could hold the key to developing the next generation of antibiotic treatments.

For the past two decades, researchers have investigated how the beetle preserves meat at room temperature, seeking to harness its antibacterial, antifungal, and food preservation properties for human use. Now, scientists have discovered a new super power: These beetles are even resistant to powerful deadly insecticides, a finding that raises even more excitement about studying the beetle to discover new life-saving drugs.

The soil-dwelling American burying beetle traffics in death, a lifestyle that regularly exposes it to a myriad of pathogens.

For example, to feed its young, it scavenges small pathogen-laden dead animals like mice, prairie dogs, and birds. After sniffing out a carcass from up to two miles away, the beetle joins a mate in burying the dead animal, removing its fur or feathers, rolling it into a ball, and covering it in oral and anal secretions that keep it fresh for weeks or more. The brood ball serves as a shelter and food source for future young that the pair raises together, a unique example of biparental care in the insect world.

But as crafty and resilient against germs as they are, the beetles are threatened by habitat loss and environmental change.A recent study in PLOS One, sought to figure out how neonicotinoids, the most common type of insecticide in the United States, impact the beetle. Derived from nicotine, this class of insecticides, which is prohibited in the European Union, helps control pest populations by disrupting their neurotransmitters but can also have the same effects on other non-pest insects like burying beetles.

(Cicadas are back—and this time it’s the ‘mother of all broods’)

The study’s scientists had previously studied and documented how adult dung beetles usually die from exposure to neonicotinoids, and were curious to see if another type of burying beetle would face the same fate.

To their surprise, the research revealed that beetles exposed to neonicotinoids recover surprisingly quickly, suggesting they possess unique detoxification abilities.

“They roll over on their back, they twitch, they're hyperactive, they extend their wings without flying,” says study co-authorWyatt Hoback, an entomologist at OSU. They squirm but they don’t die like most other insects would. “Most of the time, that set of symptoms leads to the death of the insect. But interestingly, with the American burying beetle, they act intoxicated and like they're going to die for a day, and then the next day, they're back to normal.”

The scientists had two big takeaways from the findings. First, it’s not all good news. Sure, the beetles can survive the poison. But the altered behavior it causes leaves them vulnerable to predator attacks and reduces the time they spend feeding, pointing to theneed to reduce their exposure to neonicotinoids in the wild. Federally listed as endangered in 1989, conservation and reintroduction efforts have increased the beetle’s numbers across parts of its historic range in the northeastern and midwestern U.S., leading to itsdownlisting to threatened in 2020. Reducing exposure to pesticides will help maintain their recovery.

Second, the researchers were surprised by the beetle's impressive ability to bounce back after being poisoned. Hoback who has been studying the beetle for more than 25 years, says the findings further his belief that the beetle’s holds exciting medical promise for humans.

Since the beetles they were testing had never encountered insecticides before, the researchers believe the beetles evolved biological detoxifiers due to their unique lifestyle. They suspect that frequent exposure to meat-eating bacteria and other pathogens may have led the species to develop a natural defense system to shield itself from harmful substances.

Now, the researchers are studying the genome and microbiome of the beetle, including its oral and anal secretions, to pinpoint the unique genes and bacteria that help the beetle detoxify neonicotinoids and preserve meat at room temperature. So far, the scientists havecultured 11 different species of bacteriafrom the beetle, one of which is a species completely new to science. Molecular sequencing can identify the bacteria but then the scientists must study how the bacteria work.

These questions could, one day, yield treatments for stubborn and deadly problems. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, orMRSA, is a type of staph that can be resistant to several antibiotics. A concerning problem in hospitals and with pro-athletes, the aggressive pathogen can eat away at living flesh.

“If we could find the way that the beetles deal with everything from gangrene to staph aureus in the environment, then we have the possibility of being able to sequence the specific proteins that are involved and make that into a medication,” Hoback says.

The researchers are interested to keep studying the beetles that were exposed to the insecticide and then recovered, looking at how the exposure may have triggered lifesaving genes to turn on. This “upregulation” process could leads to the production of more proteins that can help address environmental threats like toxins or meet other cellular demands.

Immo Hansen, a molecular biology professorat New Mexico State University who has collaborated on American burying beetle studies with Hoback, believes that based on these new findings and past ones that the beetles and their microbes could hold the key to the next generation of antibiotics. “They must have antibacterial properties that could be used to fight bacterial infections in humans,” he says.

Whether the beetles are exposed to insecticides or rotting flesh, their physiology comes to their rescue, most likely in the form of gene upregulation that protects and keeps them healthy, an ability that could greatly improve human health if better understood.

“We have to identify which parts of that are of most interest for human benefit,” says Hoback.

“Is it the bacteria or the beetle itself expressing enzymes that allows recovery,” asks Hoback.

107,National Geographic,Video,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/impact/article/pablo-popi-garcia-borboroglu-explorer-story,"The Argentinian marine biologist and conservationist has spent the past 36 years championing the world’s penguins and their habitats. The penguins in turn fuel his passion anew each day.

The first timeNational Geographic ExplorerPablo “Popi” Garcia Borboroglu set foot in a penguin colony, he felt the world fall into place. Swept up in the overwhelming energy of half a million black-and-white, flightless seabirds surrounding him on the Patagonian coastline, Borboroglu experienced his own eureka moment.

“I felt that they were so vulnerable and that I needed to help them. It's not something that I can easily describe, but I felt like I needed to dedicate my life to them.”

He was only 19 years old during that life-changing visit, but Borboroglu had actually been hearing about penguins for almost as long as he could remember. Growing up in Argentine Patagonia, he was enraptured by his grandmother’s stories of traveling by horse and wagon to visit penguin colonies during the 1920s and 30s. “She was participating in ecotourism a hundred years ago!” he marvels.

These stories nurtured a budding appreciation for the birds that would later blossom into full-blown career ambitions when the window of opportunity came.

In his early 20s, after putting his original plans to become an ambassador on hold, Borboroglu was back in Patagonia working as a tour guide. “During those years in the province I live in, 40,000 penguins died annually due to oil spills,” he recalls. “I would come to the beach and see penguins dying or dead, covered by oil.”

Heart stirred by the aftermath, he set up a rehabilitation center to nurse affected penguins back to health and soon came to a realization: “I couldn’t dedicate my life to washing penguins. I need to be more useful to them.” Borboroglu returned to university, focusing this time on a doctorate degree in marine biology with a specialization in seabirds, particularly penguins.

He hasn’t looked back since. In a career spanning over three decades and counting, Borboroglu cofounded the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN)Penguin Specialist Groupand conducts research at theNational Scientific and Technical Research Council(CONICET) of Argentina. He heads up theGlobal Penguin Society, an international organization advancing the conservation of all penguin species and their ecosystems through scientific research, protection of penguin habitats and education. Through their continual efforts, the Global Penguin Society has been able to protect a cumulative 32 million acres of penguin habitat and 2.5 million penguins worldwide.

Recognized numerous times for his impact in penguin conservation, Borboroglu received theWhitley Gold AwardandRolex Award for Enterprisein 2018, and theIndianapolis Prizein 2023. This year, the National Geographic Society has named Borboroglu aRolex National Geographic Explorer of the Year recipientalongside fellow ExplorerBertie Gregoryfor their joint contributions to wildlife conservation.

Borboroglu firmly believes there’s still more to be done, and that urges him into the field day in and day out with various Global Penguin Society project teams. “We have actions in different countries going at the same time. Depending on the time of year, I’ll go to New Zealand, to Chile, to Argentina to help out the teams that are operating there.”

At the time of this writing, it’s summer in the Southern Hemisphere — breeding season for almost all penguins. Borboroglu is currently working atMagellanic penguincolonies near his home in Patagonia.

“It’s a big moment for them right now,” he says. After three months of staying in their nests and being fed by their parents, the chicks have grown large enough to venture into the ocean for the first time.

For the Global Penguin Society, breeding season means an abundance of data to collect. They conduct censuses on colonies to estimate population size over time, an indicator of colony success. Marking hundreds of nests at the beginning of summer, they follow each egg and chick to quantify breeding performance.

“Every nest is a different series, a different story, and we’ve studied so many penguins for so long. In one of the colonies, one pair has been together breeding and meeting for at least 17 years.”

To understand penguins’ ocean activity, Borboroglu and his team attach waterproof tracking devices on adults to learn where in the ocean they search for food, how far they must swim and how deep they dive.

Certain penguins are outfitted with water-activated critter cameras on their backs. When they enter the ocean, the cameras start rolling, filming up to 10 hours in high definition. “We see how penguins get together with other penguins, how they chase the fish, and how they collaborate with each other to get more food. Sometimes you can see how the species compete with their prey, and sometimes they dive so deep that it goes completely dark.”

Interacting with the penguins has always been a highlight in Borboroglu’s work. He carefully steps around the small birds and their nest entrances, offering greetings as he makes his way through the colony.

“Going back to a penguin colony is always a party, so I say, ‘Hola, chicos,’ like with friends. Every time we measure them or we deploy a track, I like to thank them because they're making a contribution: ‘Thank you for carrying this. Thank you for bringing the information.’”

Using all this data, the Global Penguin Society creates maps that visualize penguin movement in the ocean. Currently followingthe swimming routes of eight Magellanic penguin coloniesin Patagonia, they’ve affectionately given each of the tracked penguins a name and profile. Many are named after celebrities — there’s a Taylor Swift and a Messi that penguin enthusiasts can follow along on their ocean journeys ontheir website.

While the names are all in good fun, Borboroglu shares, “all this tracking information is important because it allows us to justify if there is a need for protection in certain regions of the ocean.”

For most of their existence, penguins have adapted extraordinarily well to changes in their environment, he explains.

From their origins in New Zealand over 60 million years ago, they swam across ancient waters to take up residence in thetropical and desertic climes of South America, South Africa and Australia, and put down roots in theinhospitable, icy conditions of Antarctica. “People get disappointed in my talks when I say, ‘I’m sorry, penguins are not originally from Antarctica,’” he laughs.

Dubbed the “perfect explorer” by Borboroglu, some penguin species like the Magellanic swim an estimated 10,000 miles (160 kilometers) per year between swims for food and their seasonal migration according to the Global Penguin Society’s tracking data. In perspective, that’s the equivalent of swimming around the planet 12 times in one penguin’s lifetime, around 35 years.

Other species like Antarctica’semperor penguinsdon’t migrate, but they brave temperatures of minus-60 degrees Fahrenheit (-51 degrees Celsius) and winds gusting over 100 miles an hour (160 kilometers per hour) while incubating eggs. They dive 1,500 feet (457 meters) deep in frigid waters and can stay there for about 23 minutes.

Today, however, penguins havethe lowest adaptation speedof all birds. Over half of all penguin species are listed as threatened by the IUCN.

Borboroglu and his colleagues considered the effects of factors like ocean temperature or animal size on adaptation speed, but he’s not confident in any explanation for the stark decline in penguin adaptation yet. “This only makes the need to protect penguins more urgent than ever,” he emphasizes, “or the current pace of climate change will exceed the adaptive capability of penguins.”

The Global Penguin Society keeps a watchful eye on how warming seas are causing shifts in prey distribution, leading to penguinstraveling even longer distancesand expending more energy to hunt. Intensifying heatwaves bringlethal temperaturesfor penguins, and trigger wildfires. “That’s a big problem because penguins do not seem to recognize the fire as a threat,” Borboroglu explains. “In contrast with other species, they don’t escape, they don’t run away. They just stay in their nests and die.”

With such global phenomena in mind, their goal is to minimize the impact of human-related threats as much as possible so penguins might be better able to cope with the effects of climate change.

Offshore oil developments and spills contaminate or destroy marine environments that penguins rely on, harming both them and their prey. Fisheries — especially those that are mismanaged and located near existing colonies — compete with penguins for food. It’s not uncommon for Borboroglu to receive reports of penguins entangled in nets during fishing operations.

In cases like these, the Global Penguin Society’s faithful data collection on penguin range in the ocean becomes powerful leverage in the push for conservation measures. “We can say, ‘Okay, there’s a problem here,’ because penguins overlap with fisheries at sea, and then we see if we can create a marine protected area there or improve the management of their activities.”

Borboroglu estimates that penguins spend 80% of their lives in the ocean — that’s why Global Penguin Society has focused heavily on the creation of marine protected areas to protect pristine ocean habitat. “We only see them on land because they need a dry place to build a nest and incubate the eggs. Otherwise we wouldn't be seeing them,” he jokes.

Lately, however, Borboroglu’s become increasingly concerned with human disturbance on land.

In 2022, he was alarmed to find a landowner had bulldozed over 22,000 square feet  (2044 square meters) of a colony in Patagonia during the summer breeding season and constructed a mile-long road, destroying an area dense with burrow nests that harbored chicks and eggs.

Borboroglu’s team collected evidence of the destruction and brought it to court — thefirst environmental caseto receive an oral trial in Argentina’s history. “It was devastating, it was exhausting,” he recalls.

After a three-year legal battle, the landowner was found guilty, and a proposal to expand the protected area of the land from 210 to 1,600 hectares was approved, safeguarding 180,000 penguin pairs among other wildlife. A provincial law to protect all wildlife is in progress, alongside proposals to include environmental crimes in the national penal code.

“We need to be able to protect the most fragile place, the colonies where the penguins are for months, protecting their chicks and eggs with their partners. [This case] highlighted the need for more legislation to protect and prevent future harm to the environment. And I think more is needed everywhere, globally.”

It’s Borboroglu’s longstanding hope that one day, penguins and humans will reach a harmonious coexistence. While the landowner case ended in litigation, the Global Penguin Society usually opts to negotiate through colony management plans in conversation with governments, landowners and other interested parties.

“You kind of design the use of the colony. Say this area is very fragile, so people cannot get close to this space. But this other area can be used for science; this one can be open for visitors and photos.”

The Global Penguin Society encourages well-managed ecotourism, creating jobs that incentivize the community in a positive feedback loop. “As soon as the community sees that it’s much better to protect, that’s a home run, because then you don't need to be there policing people. They become the wardens. I think that's the great success when people really buy into what conservation means.”

To Borboroglu, it’s about creating a holistic culture of conservation. He sees it as a slow, educative process, sharing values that become part of a cultural inheritance transmitted from generation to generation. He connects the idea back to his own origins, of his grandmother telling him stories and implanting an early love for the animals.

Now 36 years into the job, Borboroglu’s tireless passion is clear as he talks about penguins. “How can we quit if we see these little guys? They face incredible challenges — storms, predators, climate change — and yet they keep going, focused and determined. Being surrounded by these penguins, it fuels my conservation energy tank somehow.”

Hard won victories also give him hope. Seventeen years ago, Borboroglu’s team discovered a new colony ofonly 12 penguinsin an area impacted by heavy human disturbance: hunting, fishing, setting bushfires and trash disposal. Working together with the landowner to establish protections, the colony began to grow. Today, that colony is over 8,000 breeders strong.

“I'm positive because I see the effects of action. They weren’t useless. I see a lot of areas that are now protected and there are hundreds of species thriving there because we did something. When you do something, you fight the anxiety.”

Right now, Borborolgu is preparing for the premiere of National Geographic’s “Secrets of the Penguins,” the latest documentary series in the Emmy-award winning “Secrets of” franchise, executive-produced byNational Geographic Explorer at Large James Cameron.

While it won’t be his first on-screen appearance, it will be the first show that challenged him to share the magnitude of never-before-seen penguin behaviors with an audience.

In one scene, Borboroglu is nestled on the rocky Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) coast, witnessing two different species of penguin — a rockhopper and a macaroni — breed successfully and raise viable “rockaroni” offspring. “That was unbelievable, like witnessing evolution with your own eyes.”

He hopes the wonder of such moments permeates through the screen, instilling within viewers a sense of awe that morphs into deeper empathy.

“Facts are amazing as long as they are shaped in a way that can reach the emotions of people. I’m hopeful that people will learn more, but more so that they will feel that penguins and their oceans deserve our attention and action.”

With “Secrets of the Penguins” shining a light on all the astonishing ways these small seabirds carve out their survival across the Southern Hemisphere, the world draws one step closer to the culture of conservation that Borboroglu believes in.

“We are all so connected on this planet. It gives us everything, so there are many things we can do to thank it, to change its trajectory. It’s up to us.”

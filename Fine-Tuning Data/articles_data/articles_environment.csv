But then something unusual appeared on his screen: A beaver dam so huge, it was more than twice the length of theHoover Dam. Locatedin Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta, Canada, the world’s largest beaver dam is at least 2790 feet long. It likely contains thousands of trees and appears to have required the handiwork of at least two beaver families. It’s believed the beavers began the construction project up to three decades ago. While it’s an impressive feat of animal engineering, the dam is not very scenic. “The hodgepodge of mud, branches, stones, and twigs is cloaked in a layer of grass, meaning it’s been there for a while,”Atlas Obscurareports. “The dam stretches across a remote wetland area, which provides the creatures with both plenty of fresh water and bountiful building materials.” In fact, the dam is located in such an inhospitable area of Canadian swampland that it isn’t known to have been visited by humans until2014, when Rob Mark, a member of the Explorers Club in New York City, made the trek. He began his journey in Fort Chipewyan, more than 120 miles away, and it took him five hours to cover the final mile (the ground wasthatboggy). “It was the only hard ground around for miles so I was happy to stand on it,” hesaidabout reaching the dam. Beaversbuild dams for a slew of reasons—take food storage. The critters will hidecachesof food at the bottom of ponds and will build dams to increase the water’s depth, ensuring their stockpile of goodies won’t freeze over. Dams also function as a security system. “They create a habitat with lots of water like a moat around their lodges so they can swim and [dive] and keep one step ahead of predators such as coyotes and bears,” biologist Sharon BrowntoldThe Telegraph. This isn’t the only record-breaking beaver home in Canada, either. Thie also discovered that Pakwaw Lake, Saskatchewan, has what is likely the highest density of beaver dams in that country, and possibly the world—more than 20 dams and lodges per square kilometer (or about 247 acres).

1,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653645/how-to-dispose-of-wrapping-paper,,"As the pile of wrapping paper grows on the living room floor, the annual holiday-morning question inevitably arises: What do wedowith all this? Does it all have to go straight into the trash? Canwrapping paper be recycled? What about this sparkly stuff? Does it matter that it has tape on it? This year, your holiday doesn’t need to be interrupted by a disposal debate. We’re here with the answers. It’s tempting to assume the answer to therecyclingquestion is in the name itself: It’s wrapping paper, after all. Surely it can join the rest of your cardboard boxes and junk mail in the recycling bin? As you may have guessed, however, it’s a bit more complicated than that. The truth is, a lot of wrapping “paper” on the market isn’t actually paper at all. Metallic, glittery, and see-through papers are all at least partially plastic, meaning they can’t be remade into other paper products. Even somewrapping paperthatispure paper isn’t worth putting in the bin. Super thin wrapping paper, for example, doesn’t contain enough of the quality fibers extracted during the recycling process. But it’s not all bad news! Regular matte paper (even if it’s colorful) can be recycled, no problem. If you want to make sure your wrapping paper is recyclable, just put it through the scrunch test, which works just the way you’d think it would: Crumple a piece ofthe wrapping paperin question. If it stays scrunched, it’s good to recycle. If it springs back flat, it has to go in the trash. What about the rest of the pile ofdiscarded wrapping materials? Tissue paper is best placed in the compost, while you can approach gift bags the same way you would paper (just make sure you take off the handles). Bows, ribbons, and tape should all stay out of the recycling bin. The best thing to do with your discarded wrapping paper and assorted accoutrements is to reuse whatever you can! Sturdy wrapping paper that hasn’t been ripped can be folded up and used again next year. Bows and nice ribbons, too, are easily stowed and reused. Alternatively, you can turn to moresustainable wrapping alternativeslikenewspapers, fabric, boxes, and reusable bags. Whatever you do, don’t fall into the trap of “wishcycling”—a.k.a. erring on the side of assuming things are recyclable because you figure it’s worth a try. Despite our best intentions, this kind of pitch-and-hope mentality can cause headaches for your recycling company and interfere with the process. Brent Bell, the VP of recycling operations at Waste Management,told Mother Jonesin 2019 that a quarter of the material they receive is garbage that has to be extracted and thrown away. So, if you’re not sure whether a sheet ofwrapping papercan be recycled, do the (admittedly counter-intuitive) ecologically safe thing: Put it in the trash.

2,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/518726/great-smog-descended-london-65-years-ago-and-took-almost-long-solve,,"Heavy fogs have long been a part of life in London. In his novelBleak House,Charles Dickenswrote: “Fog everywhere. Fog up the river where it flows among green airs and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping, and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city ... Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds.” Yet a full 100 years after the celebrated author wrote those words, the city would become enveloped in a dangerous mix of fog and smoke—the likes of which they had never experienced, and were not prepared for. When the smog finally lifted, thousands of people were dead. And it would take nearly 65 years for scientists to pinpoint the reason for what has become known asThe Great Smog of 1952, one of the deadliest environmental disasters in thehistoryof the world. December 5, 1952 started out just like any other day in London, albeit a tremendously foggy one. But as the day wore on, it became clear that there was something different about the darkness that had descended on the city, which would hang there until December 9. People who were caught outside in the weather found themselves gasping for air, barely able to open their eyes from the sting the smoky atmosphere was delivering. Those who could see couldn’t see very far; as visibility dwindled to practically zero, pedestrians had trouble seeing their own feet while motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles. For several days, the city was essentially shut down. It all began with a cold front, which led more and more Londoners to crank up their coal stoves and gather around them for warmth. While the smoke from the city’s chimneys would normally disperse into the atmosphere, a lack of wind and an unfortunately timedanticyclonepositioned over the city ended up trapping the smoke, which mixed with the fog and other pollutants, creating a lethal atmosphere. “You had this swirling,” funeral director Stan Cribbtold NPRin 2002, “like somebody had set a load of car tires on fire.” Cribb, who at the time was working as a mortician’s assistant, was on his way to a wake with his uncle—who was also his boss—with a line of mourners behind them. According to NPR: ""Neither man knew a catastrophe was brewing. They didn't know that a mass of stagnant air had just clamped a lid over London, trapping the smoke from millions of residential coal fires at ground level. Cribb remembers being stunned by the blackness of the gathering fog. After a few minutes he couldn't see the curb from his spot behind the wheel. After a few more minutes, Tom Cribb got out and started walking in front of the hearse, to keep his nephew on the road. He carried a powerful hurricane lantern in one hand, but it was useless. 'It's like you were blind,' says Cribb."" When the fog finally lifted, reports estimated that at least 4000 people had been killed and 150,000 were hospitalized, though in the years since the total death toll has risen to approximately 12,000. Fans of the Netflix seriesThe Crownwill likely remember the season 1 episode in whichQueen Elizabeth(played by Claire Foy) and then-Prime MinisterWinston Churchill(portrayed by John Lithgow) were forced to contend with the deadly event. Always aiming for accuracy, directorStephen Daldry toldEntertainment Weeklythat they weren’t about to use CGI to recreate the Great Smog. “We had to get a great, huge warehouse and fill it full of fog to create the great pea soup of 1952,” Daldry said. “We did it for real—CG didn’t look good enough for us.” Amazingly, it wasn't until 2016 that a global team of scientists announced that they may have finally solved the mystery of the Great Smog, and published theirfindingsin the November 2016 issue ofProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences(PNAS). “People have known that sulfate was a big contributor to the fog, and sulfuric acid particles were formed from sulfur dioxide released by coal burning for residential use and power plants, and other means,” Dr. Renyi Zhang, a professor at Texas A&M University and one of the paper’s lead authors, said in a statement. “But how sulfur dioxide was turned into sulfuric acid was unclear. Our results showed that this process was facilitated by nitrogen dioxide, another co-product of coal burning, and occurred initially on natural fog. Another key aspect in the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfate is that it produces acidic particles, which subsequently inhibits this process. Natural fog contained larger particles of several tens of micrometers in size, and the acid formed was sufficiently diluted. Evaporation of those fog particles then left smaller acidic haze particles that covered the city.” In addition to helping to solve a troubling environmental disaster that had confounded scientists for decades, Zhang and his colleagues’ research also helped to determine how to best deal with similar air pollution problems today, including those faced by several cities in China, which is home to some of the world’s most polluted cities. “The difference in China is that the haze starts from much smaller nanoparticles, and the sulfate formation process is only possible with ammonia to neutralize the particles,” Zhang said. “In China, sulfur dioxide is mainly emitted by power plants, nitrogen dioxide is from power plants and automobiles, and ammonia comes from fertilizer use and automobiles. Again, the right chemical processes have to interplay for the deadly haze to occur in China. Interestingly, while the London fog was highly acidic, contemporary Chinese haze is basically neutral.” “The government has pledged to do all it can to reduce emissions going forward, but it will take time,” he added. “We think we have helped solve the 1952 London fog mystery and also have given China some ideas of how to improve its air quality. Reduction in emissions for nitrogen oxides and ammonia is likely effective in disrupting this sulfate formation process.” Though it would be hard to call it a silver lining, the Great Smog of 1952 did have one positive effect: It forced the country’s government, and its people, to become more aware of the impact their actions had on their environment. On July 5, 1956, less than four years after London was enveloped in a lethal darkness, Parliament enacted theClean Air Act 1956, which banned the burning of pollutants across the UK.

Those red, orange, and gold leaves may be visible outside your window sooner than you think, and this interactive map fromSmokyMountains.comshows you exactly when to expect them. Fall foliage normally peaks some time after theautumnal equinox, which falls on September 22 in 2024; but exactly when depends on variables like rainfall and temperature. Each year, the SmokyMountains.com tourism website looks at weather forecasts and historical trends from NOAA and puts together an interactive map showing when foliage is predicted to peak across the contiguous United States. According to the map, the northernmost parts of the northern states—like Montana, Maine, and North Dakota—should already see minimal autumn foliage by early September. Fall colors at these latitudes will peak between late September and early October. Meanwhile, mid-Atlantic states like Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia won’t be treated to the best of the season’s offerings until the middle of October. By the end of that month, most of the northern half of the country will have already had its share of fall colors. Peak foliage won’t arrive in southern states like Georgia, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana until early November. By sliding the scale beneath the map atSmokyMountains.com, you can see when foliage is expected to peak in your part of the country.

4,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71769/5-environmentally-smart-ways-dispose-your-christmas-tree,,"What’s the environmentally safest way to dispose of yourChristmas tree? It’s hard to say. If it’s grown, managed, transported, and recycled efficiently, a real Christmas tree’s environmental impact should be near neutral. Unfortunately, not all Christmas tree farms are equal in their environmental impact. The most eco-friendly way totreat a Christmas treewould be to leave the tree in the ground, where it belongs, so that you never have to dispose of it. Of course, then you wouldn’t have one in your house to bring festive cheer. One thing youcando is be environmentally smart when it comes to the tree's disposal. When it's time to say goodbye to this year’s Christmas tree, why not try one of these eco-friendly methods? If you’re lucky enough to have access to a large wood chipper, you may be able to chip the entire tree.Woodchipsmake a great decorative landscaping material (giving you a head start on spring). If your tree hasn’t yet let go of its needles—and you haven’t yet let go of Christmas—get craftywith it. Cut off small branches and bind them around a circle of wire to make an attractive wreath. This looks even better if some of the cones are still attached. If you’re feeling really adventurous, you could set up an essential oil extractor to get a supercharged Christmas scent. If you are already distilling alcohol, you have everything you need (here's howto do it). With a little less effort and equipment, you can make a weaker liquid calledhydrosol, which is a fragrant condensate water containing water-soluble parts of the needles—all of which is much easier to do than it probably sounds. Many legumes, such as garden peas, are thigmotropic, meaning they respond to objects they touch, growing in coils along or up them. Needle-free Christmas tree branches have lots of twigs, texture, and knobby protrusions for peas and beans to get a grip on. This allows them to grow upwards strongly toward light. Simply stick asmall tree branchin the soil next to each new shoot for a free, effective legume-climbing frame. Another advantage of this technique is that it makes grazing animals less likely to munch those tender green shoots, as they tend to avoid getting Christmas tree twigs spiked up their noses. You can also strip the branches off your tree and use them to protect delicate plants from snow. Come January, it’s cold, the festivities are over, work looms, and you’ve got too much on your mind to be thinking about dead Christmas tree horticulture or crafts. Fortunately, a simple solution is at hand: Remove all of the ornaments and lights and take it to the curb. Many municipal trash collection services will pick up your tree and mulch it to be used for landscaping public spaces and parks. If your city or county doesn’t provide curbside pickup, it may operateChristmas tree recycling pointswhere you can take your tree for chipping. Some “TreeCycle” points will even exchange your tree for a bag of wood chips or chip mulch. OK, this probably means that you’ll have to jam that Christmas tree into your car once more, but Christmas tree recycling is a quick and easy, environmentally friendly option. After you’ve had your Christmas cheer, why shouldn’t fish have some fun? Several communities have programs in place where they’ll take your old Christmas tree, drill a hole in the base, tie a brick to it, and throw it into a lake to create a newfish habitat. When humans create artificial lakes, they tend to be relatively featureless on the bottom for easy dredging. That’s great for us, but it means baby fish have nowhere to escape predators. Christmas trees provide a nice, temporary place for the fish to hide out and explore. If, on the other hand, you’d like to see your Christmas tree mauled by a pride of lions, that’s OK too! Some zoos around the world takeChristmas tree donations(but please remove all thetinselandtinsel alternativesfirst) and allow the animals to play with them. Some Christmas trees are edible (not cypress, yew, and cedar—those are poisonous). If you have a chemical and pesticide-free tree, though, you can chow down on your holiday decor.How to Eat Your Christmas Tree, a 2020 cookbook by Julia Georgallis, is full of both sweet and savory recipes.

5,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/55994/7-fascinating-facts-about-narwhals,,"Thememesums it up: Narwhals, swimming in the ocean and causing a commotion, really are awesome. The “unicorns of the sea” have fascinated mariners and royalty for centuries, yet scientists still don’t understand some keys details about the Arctic whales’ life cycle, habits, and unique tusks. Here’s what we do know. Like their cousins,beluga whales, narwhals spend their whole lives incold Arctic seas. Most arefoundin the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay area between Canada and Greenland, as well as in the Greenland Sea between Greenland and Svalbard. Thesemedium-size whaleshave stubby pectoral flippers and lack a dorsal fin, which allows them to swim underneath ice floes and access the surface for air; adults narwhals’ white coloring with gray and black mottling camouflages them among the sea ice. The narwhal’s scientific name,Monodon monoceros, refers to their singular characteristic and means “one tooth, one horn.” The narwhal’s tusk appears to be situated in the center of its head, but it is really an exaggerated left front tooth that protrudes from the whale’s upper jaw. The right front tooth remains small and inside the mouth. Though narwhals are classified as odontocetes (toothed whales), they literally have only thesetwo teeth in their mouths. Most males sport tusks, but only about 15 percent of females do. Narwhals feed on rather largefish, such as cod, halibut, squid, and shrimp, but they don’t grab at the prey with their teeth. Instead, they create a vacuum with their mouths and suck in the fish—though this process, often taking place thousands of feet below the ocean’s surface in total darkness, hasnever been directly observedor filmed. Scientistshavewitnessed narwhals using their tusks to stun cod before capturing and eating them. Narwhal tusks (or teeth) are unique in the animal kingdom: they are the only straight tusks and the only teeth known to grow in a spiral. Stranger still, while most teeth (including human teeth) have a hard exterior and a soft, sensitive interior, narwhal teeth are the opposite. “To find a tooth that is soft on the outside and has its most dense part around the pulp was completely odd,” narwhal expert Martin Nweeia, a dental surgeon and lecturer at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, told NPR after making thisdiscoveryin 2005. Its tough core and soft outer layer result in atuskthat is both strong andflexible. It can bend significantly without breaking, which is important for one as long as the narwhal’s. Male narwhalsaverage 15 feetin length and weigh 3500 pounds, not including their tusks, which begin protruding from their mouths at age 3 and continue growing throughout the whales’ lives. Tusks measuring 9 or 10 feet are not uncommon. Female narwhals are smaller than males, averaging 13 feet long and 2000 pounds. One theory is that the tusk can be used as a weapon (and not just on cod), though this claim lacks sufficient evidence. Another is that it’s an accessory for finding mates and asserting dominance, much like peacock feathers or deer antlers. Nweeia and his team have proposed that it acts as a sensor for picking up environmental cues. Nweeia’sresearchhas found that the tusk is porous and full of nerves. It may sense external stimuli like water pressure, temperature, and salinity, and send those signals to the brain. To test this theory, Nweeia fitted narwhals with a “tusk jacket” that insulated the tusk from environmental factors. Then, researchers pumped the jacket full of water samples of varying salinity levels to mimic variations in seawater. They found that different levels of salinity caused the narwhals’ heart rates to fluctuate, indicating they could sense the change and had a physical reaction to it. That suggests narwhal tusks aresensory organsthat can measure salt concentrations, and perhaps many more conditions in its environment. However, if the narwhal tusk is a mechanism for sensing the environment, why wouldn’t more females have evolved to have them as well? The lack of tusks among female narwhals seems to support the theory that the tusk is mainly an accessory for garnering attention and establishing dominance among males. Scientists are still looking for the answer. Narwhalis likelyderivedfrom the Old Norsenahvalr, combining the wordsna(“corpse”) andhvalr(“whale”). It may be a reference to the whale’s speckled gray and white skin and its resemblance to dead bodies that had been floating in the ocean for a while. Or,nahvalrmay derive from West Norse and mean “whale distinguished by a long narrow projection.” One ounce of narwhal skin containsas much vitamin Cas one ounce of an orange—about 15 milligrams. According to a 1930ssurvey, narwhal skin and eyes were important sources of the vitamin among Inuit in East Greenland, whose traditional diet was primarily meat. The researchers concluded that this foodstuff, along with algae, preventedscurvyamong the population. Unlikebeluga whales, narwhals do not thrive in captivity. In the 1960s, the Vancouver Aquarium launched aprogramto capture or obtain narwhals from the Arctic and display them in the world’s first (and only) permanent exhibit. Eventually, the museum caught or purchased six wild narwhals, which arrived in Vancouver with much fanfare and interest from the public. Unfortunately, all six died months after their arrival. (A young narwhal sent to the New York Aquarium alsodiedwithin a month). Likegreat white sharks, narwhals apparently aren’t meant to be tamed. In the Middle Ages, the narwhal’s long, straight, pearly-white tusk was thought to be aunicornhorn with the power to purify water and do other kinds of magic. Numerous tusks were given toroyalty. In the 16th century,Queen Elizabeth Ireceived oneworth £10,000; she also sipped water from a goblet made from a portion of a tusk. English monarchs were known tochip off a bit of the tuskand imbibe it as a therapeutic drink or in a potion believed to prevent poisoning. The Hapsburg rulers had a tusk made into a scepter and adorned with precious gems, but Denmark really went all out: the Danish monarchs’anointing thronewas built in 1660 and incorporated several “unicorn horns” in its design, which were easily sourced from the Danish territories of Iceland and the Faroe Islands.

6,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30820/how-smokey-bear-helped-win-world-war-ii,,"Forest fires posed a terrifying threat duringWorld War II. Fighting wildfires required huge amounts of precious manpower that otherwise could have been put toward building tanks or guns. Infernos also swallowed up thousands of acres of wood, a crucial ingredient in everything from warships to gunstocks. To curb forest fires, the U.S. Forest Service and the WarAdvertisingCouncil teamed up on a propaganda campaign.Walt Disneyloaned the government the use of forest-dwellingBambifor a year to get things rolling, but the Forest Service wanted its own anti-fire mascot. Commercial illustrator Albert Staehle drafted an image of a shovel-toting bear. It took a few drafts, but after some government-mandated tweaks—including making the bear wear pants—Smokey was born. When Smokey debuted in 1944, his first posters bore the slogan “Smokey says—Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires!” Although the words weren’t as catchy as the venerable “Only YOU can prevent forest fires”— a line he picked up in 1947—the character resonated with the public. Soon, Smokey was showing up on billboards and in magazines, and Americans became a bit more careful with their campfires and cigarette butts. When forestry workers rescued an injuredbear cubfrom a New Mexico wildfire in 1950, veterinarians managed to nurse him back to health, and the Forest Service adopted the cub as the living version of Smokey. He eventually came to live at the Smithsonian’s National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., where he became abeloved advocatefor forest fire prevention. The bear received so much fan mail that in 1964 he got his own ZIP code (20252). Today, the Smokey Bear wildfire prevention drive is thelongest-runningpublic service announcement campaign in Americanhistory.According tothe Smithsonian Institution Archives, the number of forest fires in the U.S. dropped from 201,511 in 1942 to fewer than 145,868 in 1974, despite the midcentury boom in population and development. The areas of burned forest fell from 31 million acres to under 3 million acres in that period, while officials estimated that Smokey’s influence preserved 16 million dollars’ worth of timber, watersheds, and public recreation areas. Even now, the Department of Agriculture, of which the Forest Service is a part, pulls in more than $1 million a year licensing Smokey’s likeness, all of which goes to—you guessed it—fire prevention programs.

7,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71885/floridas-radioactive-fountain-youth,,"The fountain of youth that Ponce de León is said to havesearched for 500 years agocould be a radioactive well beneath an abandonedFloridalot. At least that’s what somePunta Gorda localsclaim. There, residents of the southwestern Florida city have been drinking the legendarywatersince the late 19th century. Back in 1926, the people of Punta Gorda raised money to construct agreen-tiled fountainfor the aquifer that still stands today. Many people swore by the water’s mystical properties; at the peak of its popularity in the mid-20th century the spigot’s handle was used so often it reportedly needed to bereplaced every six months. The frenzy surrounding the Punta Gorda fountain has since died down, largely thanks to the Clean Water Act of 1972, which requires that all public water sources be tested for a number of contaminants. The Punta Gorda fountain’s tests yielded somealarming results. The water was shown to contain 9.2 picoCuries of radium-226 isotope per liter, far exceeding the EPA’s recommended radium limit of 5 picoCuries per liter. Over the years, there has been some talk about plugging up the well for good and instead supplying it with city water, but public opposition eventually won out. Despite the well’s concerning—though not fatal—levels ofradiation, people are still placing faith in its life-extending properties. It turns out there could be somesciencesupporting this century-old superstition. In addition to radium, the fountain’s water was shown to contain high amounts of magnesium, a beneficial mineral that most people are deficient in. The water also contains magnesium sulfate, a.k.a. Epsom salt, a compound frequently added to bath water in order to ease stress and pain. The fountain may not be as popular as it was in its heyday, but there are still plenty of believers who are not deterred by the “Use Water at Your Own Risk” notice posted beside it. Some visitors show up with large jugs to fill up with water and take home with them. One gentleman was known to use the water to wash his car, while another elderly woman claimed to use it to brew her tea. When asked about the water’s health risks, Punta Gorda resident Donna Sanford told NBC2, “Well, I’m not necessarily glowing.” The Punta Gorda water spigot isn’t the only Florida landmark that claims to be the original fountain of youth. St. Augustine, theoldest city in America, is home to theFountain of Youth Archaeological Park, which memorializes the spot where Ponce de León supposedly found the fabled water source. There is no historical orarchaeological evidencesupporting this, however. There’s also no reason to believe the water from the park’s spring has life-extending properties, but at least it falls within the legal radioactivity limit. Visitors to the attraction can try the water and judge it for themselves. The Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park offers more activities beyond sipping water; historical exhibits, reenactments, and excavations—not to mention the colorful peacocks that roam the property freely—are all on the calendar at this Sunshine State landmark."
8,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501845/13-powerful-facts-about-hurricanes,,"Hurricanes are among the largest and most intense stormsnaturecan produce. Today, we know more about thesesystemsand have an easier time measuring and predicting them than ever before. But there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to hurricanes. As hurricane season kicks off (it runs from June 1 through November 30 each year), here are some things you might not know about these dangerous storms. A tropical cyclone is a compact, low-pressure system fueled by thunderstorms that draws energy from the heat generated by warm ocean waters. These tropical cyclones acquire different names depending on how strong they are and where in the world they form. A mature tropical cyclone is called ahurricanein the Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans. The same storm is called a “typhoon” near Asia and simply a “cyclone” everywhere else in the world. Not all hurricanes are picture-perfect. Some storms can look so disorganized that it takes an expert eye and advanced technology to spot them. A full-fledged hurricane can be as small as a few dozen miles across or as large as one-half of the United States, as was the case with Typhoon Tip in the western Pacific Ocean in 1979. The smallest tropical cyclone on record was 2008’s Tropical Storm Marco, a tiny storm in the Gulf of Mexico that almost made it to hurricane strength. Marco’s strong winds only extended 12 miles from the eye of the storm—a distance smaller than the length of Manhattan. The spiraling bands of wind and rain that radiate from the center of a hurricane are what give these storms their distinctive buzzsaw shape. These bands can cause damage, flooding, and eventornadoes, but the worst part of a hurricane is the eyewall, or the tight group of thunderstorms that rage around the center of the storm. The most severe winds in a hurricane usually occupy a small part of the eyewall just to the right of the storm’s forward motion, an area known as the right-front quadrant. The worst damage is usually found where this part of the storm comes ashore. The core of a hurricane is very warm—they are tropical, after all. The eye of a hurricane is formed by air rushing down from the upper levels of the atmosphere to fill the void left by the low air pressure at the surface. Air dries out and warms up as it rapidly descends through the eye toward the surface. This allows temperatures in the eye of a strong hurricane to exceed 80°F thousands of feet above theEarth's surface, where it’s typically much colder. Like humans, you can tell a lot about a hurricane by looking it in the eye. A ragged, asymmetrical eye means that the storm is struggling to strengthen. A smooth, round eye means that the storm is both stable and quite strong. A tiny eye—sometimes called a pinhole or pinpoint eye—is usually indicative of a very intense storm. An eye doesn’t last forever. Storms frequently encounter an “eyewall replacement cycle,” which is where a storm develops a new eyewall to replace the old one. A storm weakens during one of these cycles, but it can quickly grow even more intense than it originally was once the replacement cycle is completed. When Hurricane Matthew scraped the Florida coast in October 2016, the storm’s impacts were slightly less severe because the storm underwent an eyewall replacement cycle just as it made its closest approach to land. While strong winds get the most coverage on the news, wind isn’t always the most dangerous part of the storm. More than half of all deaths that result from a landfalling hurricane are due to thestorm surge, or the sea water that gets pushed inland by a storm’s winds. Most storm surges are relatively small and only impact the immediate coast, but in a larger storm likeKatrinaorSandy, the wind can push deep water so far inland that it completely submerges homes many miles from the coast. It can seem odd that California occupies hundreds of miles of coastline but always seems to evade the hurricane threat faced by the East Coast. California almost never sees tropical cyclones because the ocean is simply too cold to sustain a storm. Only a handful of tropical cyclones have ever reached California in recorded history—the worst hit San Diego in 1858. TheSan Diego Hurricanewas an oddity that’s estimated to have reached category 1 intensity as it brushed the southern half of the Golden State. Aside from satellite and radar imagery, it’s pretty hard to know exactly what a hurricane is doing unless it passes directly over a buoy or aship. This is where theHurricane Hunterscome in, a brave group of scientists with the United States Air Force and NOAA that flies specially outfitted airplanes directly into the worst of a storm to measure its winds and report back their findings. This practice began during World War II and has become a mainstay of hurricane forecasting in the decades since. The Hurricane Hunters assess the storm with all sorts of tools that measure temperature, pressure, wind, and moisture, and have weather radar onboard to give them a detailed view of the entire storm. They regularly release dropsondes to ""read"" the inside of the storm. Dropsondes are like weather balloons in reverse: instead of launching weather sensors from the ground into the sky, they drop them down through the sky to the ground. The Hurricane Hunters also have innovative sensors that measure waves andsea foamand use the data to accurately estimate how strong the winds are at the surface. Meteorologists in the United States officially startednamingtropical storms and hurricanes in the 1950s to make it easier to keep track in forecasts and news reports. Since then, naming tropical cyclones has become a worldwide effort coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization, the United Nations agency responsible for maintaining meteorological standards. Today, theAtlantic Oceanandeastern Pacific Oceaneach receive a list of alternating masculine and feminine names that are reused every six years. If a storm is particularly destructive or deadly, the WMO will “retire” the name from official lists so it’s never used again out of respect for the families of the storm’s victims and survivors. When a name is retired, another name starting with the same letter takes its place. More than 80 names have been retired from the Atlantic Ocean’s list of names since 1954. For example, the namesFlorenceandMichaelhave been retired as a result of the damage they caused during the 2018 hurricane season; they have been replaced with Francine and Milton in the 2024 list.

But, according to plant expert Peter D’Amato, they’re actually among theeasiestcarnivorousplantsto grow. Indigenous to South Africa, the Cape sundew is a favorite of carnivorous plant aficionados the world over. Not only do they grow year-round and thrive in a variety of climates, but they “hunt” their prey in a pretty spectacular manner. In the video above, watch up close as one Cape sundew plant uses its tentacles to trap and entomb an insect. Simultaneously fascinating and unsettling, the Cape sundew is just one of the many amazing carnivorous plants out there. According to London’s Natural History Museum, there are about630 carnivorous plant speciesknown toscience, and all wonderfully adapted to consume meat. Smaller carnivorous species eat microscopic prey, such as bacteria; medium-sized plants subsist on insects and their larvae, crustaceans, or even little fish. The largest meat-eating species in the plant kingdom can down vertebrates. Nepenthes rajah, a species of pitcher plant native to Borneo, is the world’sbiggest flesh-eating plant. Its bulbous, crimson-toned pitcher can hold about3 liters(0.79 gallons) of water and 2.5 liters (0.66 gallons) of digestive juices, in which it traps any prey that happens to fall in, including lizards, frogs, birds, small mammals, and insects. This spectacular species is classified asendangereddue to its need for very specific growing conditions in Borneo’s subalpine forests. American plant enthusiasts are probably most familiar with the diminutiveVenus flytrap(Dionaea muscipula), which is endemic to the coastallongleaf pine forestsof the Carolinas. In recent decades, habitat loss and poaching havethreatenedthe adorable meat-eaters’ survival. North Carolina outlawed collection of the plants from the wild in 2014, but the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declined to add the Venus flytrap to the Endangered Species List in July 2023, claiming that it didn’t meet the requirements for designation.

10,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/527175/10-clever-facts-about-raccoons,,"Whether your home is surrounded by trees or skyscrapers (which they’ve been known toscale), raccoons are likely part of your local wildlife population. They are some of the most adaptable creatures in the Americas, occupying both rural and urban areas in diverse climates. Here are some more things you might not know about the little masked bandits. Raccoons have some of the most dexterous hands in nature, as anyone who’s had a garden, cooler, or garbage can broken into by one of them knows. Native Americans were the first to note their unusual paws. The English wordraccooncomes from the Powhatan wordaroughcun, which means “animal that scratches with its hands.” The Aztecs went in a similar direction when naming the raccoonmapachitli, or “one who takes everything in its hands.” Todaymapachemeans “raccoon” in Spanish. There arethreeliving raccoon species in the genusProcyonaround the world. The most recognizable isProcyon lotor, or the common raccoon that lives in the United States. The other varieties of the animal can be found farther south, often inhabiting tropical areas. Thanks to the black markings that fall across their eyes, raccoons have been typecast as the conniving thief or trickster figure in stories for centuries. But their famous black masks do more than make them look like adorable outlaws—they also help themsee clearly. The black fur works just like the black stickersathleteswear under their eyes: The dark color absorbs incoming light, reducing glare that would otherwise bounce into their eyes and obstruct their vision. At night, when raccoons are most active, less peripheral light makes it easier for them to perceive contrast in the objects of their focus, which is essential for seeing inthe dark. It’s unusual for White House pets to start asThanksgivingdinner, but that was the case withRebecca, the raccoon that lived withCalvin Coolidgefor part of hispresidency. At the time, raccoon meat wasn’t a terribly uncommon sight on dinner tables in America. But once he met the live critter, Coolidge decided he was more interested in adopting her than having her for supper. Rebecca soon became part of the family, receiving an engraved collar for Christmas, taking part in the annual Easter Egg Roll, and frequently accompanying the president on walks around the White House grounds. Having a wild animal in the White House may sound absurd by today’s standards, but consideringCoolidge’s petsat the time also included abobcat, a goose, a donkey, two lion cubs, an antelope, and awallaby, Rebecca fit right in. The first raccoons were exported to Europe in the 1920s to stockfur farms. By way of an accidental bombing and some bored farmers just wanting to spice up the local wildlife, many raccoons escaped and founded a new population in the wild. Today, raccoons in Europe are considered aninvasive species. The animals even ended up inJapan. Their journey there had more wholesome beginnings: In the 1970s, Japanese children were obsessed with thecuddly starof the anime cartoonRascal the Raccoon. Kids demanded pet raccoons of their own, and at one point Japan was importing roughly 1500 of them a month. Naturally, many of these pets ended up back in the wild when they grew too big for families to take care of them properly. Japan has since prohibited importing and owning raccoons, but the descendants of that initial boom have spread to 42 of the country’s 47 prefectures. Raccoons are among the rare species that have actually benefited from the spread of humans. Populations in North America haveskyrocketedin the past several decades, and this is despite the destruction of much of the animals’ natural environment. Raccoons are adaptable enough to thrive in rural, urban, and suburban environments. In the forests, raccoons willeatbirds, insects, fruits, nuts, and seeds, while in residential areas they’ll scavenge for garbage and pet food. Some raccoons do their foraging in human-populated areas, then retreat into the woods during the day to sleep. Others make buildings—both abandoned and occupied—their home. Raccoons are regarded by scientists as intelligent creatures, but city dwellers may notice that their local specimens reach special levels of cunning. This may be because urban raccoons are forced to outsmart human-made obstacles on a regular basis. WhenSuzanne MacDonald, a psychologist and biologist at York University in Toronto, outfitted city raccoons with GPS collars, she discovered that they had learned to avoid major intersections. A second experiment supported the theory that raccoons accustomed to life around humans are better equipped to solve unconventional problems. MacDonald planted garbage cans containing food in urban and rural areas. When it came to opening the tricky lid, most city raccoons could figure it out while the country raccoons failed each time. In the early 20th century, raccoons were poised to become the go-to model foranimal experiments. They were some of the most curious and intelligent animals available, scientists believed, so that meant they were an obvious choice for comparative psychology studies. Though raccoons were the subject of several psychology experiments at the turn of the century, they didn’t stick around in labs for long. Unlike rats, they were hard to breed and maintain in large numbers. They also had the pesky tendencies to chew through their cages, pickpocket researchers, and hide out in air vents. Despite one researcher’s plan to breed a tamer strain of raccoon, the creature’s future in the lab never took off. While most animals use either sight, sound, or smell to hunt, raccoons rely on their sense of touch to locate goodies. Their front paws are incredibly dexterous and contain roughlyfour timesmore sensory receptors than their back paws—about the same ratio of human hands to feet. This allows them to differentiate between objects without seeing them, which is crucial when feeding at night. Raccoons can heighten their sense of touch through an act calleddousing. To humans, this can look like the animals are washing their food, but what they’re really doing is wetting their paws to stimulate the nerve endings. Like light to a human’s eyes, water on a raccoon’s hands gives it more sensory information to work with, allowing it to feel more than it would otherwise. Give raccoons a puzzle and, as long as there’s food involved, they’ll usually find a way to solve it. They’ve not only proven this time and time again in yards and campsites but in labs as well. In the early 1900s, ethologist H.B. Davis gave 12 raccoons aseries of locksto crack. To access the treats inside the boxes, they had to navigate hooks, bolts, buttons, latches, and levers, with some boxes featuring more than one lock. In the end, the raccoons were able to get past 11 of the 13 mechanisms. More recently in 2017, scientists tasked a group of raccoons with theAesop’s Fable test. The classic story, which tells of a crow dropping stones into a pitcher to get its water level to rise, has been adapted by researchers as a standard for animal intelligence. Raccoons were placed in a room with a cylinder of water with marshmallows floating on the surface and stones scattered around it. To reach the sugary snacks, they first had to make the water higher by depositing the stones. After they were shown what to do, two out of eight raccoons copied the behavior, while a third took an unexpected approach to the problem and toppled the whole thing over.

Grand Teton National Park was first established in 1929 toprotectthe high peaks of the Grand Teton Mountains and its glacial lakes. In the 1930s and 1940s, PresidentFranklin D. Rooseveltdesignated the Jackson Hole National Monument adjacent to the park, and oil scion John D. Rockefeller donated lands that he owned to the park service. The current boundaries of Grand Teton National Park werefinalized in 1950, when the national monument and Rockefeller’s property wereabsorbedinto the existing national park. People havelived on the landsnow encompassed by the park since the ice sheet retreated at the end of the lastice age, about 10,000 years ago.

The trees, also called Ashe junipers, are native to the region and an important part of the biome. Its fallen leaves create exceptionally rich and well-draining soil that supports endemicplantslike cedar sage and Texas madrone. The tree provides food and homes for the larvae of juniper hairstreak and olive butterflies. The raregolden-cheeked warbleris believed to create its nests almost exclusively from Ashe juniper bark. However, all theseecosystem servicesare not enough to convince some Texans to leave the trees alone. Some of the state’s allergy sufferers hate the trees so much that they’d like to eradicate them. According totestimonybefore the Texas House of Representatives’ Agriculture and Livestock Committee in 2012, mountain cedars don't just wreak havoc on allergies: They also pull gallons of much-neededwaterfrom Texas soil and even cause wildfires due to the resins in their wood. Some believe that, in addition to causing watery eyes and sniffly noses, the trees pose a genuine environmental threat. (Others have argued that the native junipers have evolved to bedrought-tolerant, and while they do tend to bemore flammablethan other trees—especially in drought conditions—they don’t spontaneously combust.) Despite protests, the least popular tree in Texas seems to be sticking around for now.

14,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/89004/10-fascinating-facts-about-arctic-circle,,"There’s a lot more to the northernmost part of our globe than just frigid landscapes. Read on for some fascinating facts about theArctic regionand the people and wildlife who call it home. A 2016 study published inNature Communicationsfound that the massive amounts ofbird guanoin the Arctic release gases that contribute to cloud cover, which in turn slightly reduces the temperature of the surrounding air. In some Arctic Ocean habitats, wildlife iseven more activeduring the region’s long, dark winter than it is in the summer. According to a 2015 study inCurrent Biology, “Biodiversity, abundance, growth, and reproduction in habitats studied were at similar or higher levels than in warmer months.” Researchers counted lots of plankton, crustaceans, certain cod and haddock species, and a surprising number of birds going about their business in winter. More than 800 miles beyond the Arctic Circle lies theSvalbard Global Seed Vault, a storage facility run by the Norwegian government. The structure, which was built into the permafrost, holds seeds for more than 4000 plant species—including life-sustaining food crops—keeping them safe in the event of natural or human-made disasters. American explorerRobert E. Pearyclaimed to have been the first man toreach the geographic North Pole, in April 1909. Today, however, experts argue that it was his assistant,Matthew A. Henson, who actually deserves the distinction. By the time Peary and Henson and four Inughuit dog sled drivers neared their destination, Peary was struggling with a bad case of frostbite, leaving him unable to walk. (He had to be pulled along on a sled instead.) As they got closer to the North Pole, Henson and two guides went ahead on foot, but accidentally overshot their destination—which meant that Henson technically reached the Pole about 45 minutes before Peary did. Despite its harsh conditions, about4 million peoplecall the Arctic home. Parts of the U.S., Canada, Greenland (which is a territory of Denmark), Iceland (barely), Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia are above the Arctic Circle. The largest Arctic settlements are Murmansk (population: about270,000) and Norilsk (184,000) in Russia and Tromsø (78,000) in Norway, with smaller cities in the other circumpolar countries. Inuit, of many groups and communities, make up a large majority of Arctic residents in North America and Greenland. Countries whose borders fall north of the Arctic Circle are part of theArctic Council, which, according to its website, “is the only circumpolar forum for political discussions on Arctic issues, involving all the Arctic states, and with the active participation of its Indigenous Peoples.” The council works to assess and solve environmental, economic, social, and cultural issues across the region. The Greek wordarktosmeans “bear,”and refers not to the region’s nativepolar bears, but to the circumpolar constellation Ursa Major. (Ursais Latin for “bear.”) It comprises 5.4 million square miles. By comparison, the Atlantic Ocean covers41.1 millionsquare miles, and the Pacific 62.46 million square miles. The Arctic is mostly ocean surrounded by land, whileAntarcticais land surrounded by ocean. While significant portions of both are covered in sheets of ice, the Arctic Ocean holds more heat that helps warm (relatively speaking) the surrounding air. The landmass of Antarctica, in contrast, is covered with an ice sheet more than a mile thick in places and over 9000 feet in elevation at the South Pole. Higher elevations, of course, result in colder temps. The average summer temperature at the North Pole is 32°F. At the South Pole, it’s -18°F. The famous political cartoonistThomas Nastbegan drawing illustrations of Santa Claus as part of an advertising campaign forHarper’s Weeklyin the 1860s. In a few of his drawings, he made reference to the fact that Santa’s mailing address was the North Pole—a place that had already captured the world’s imagination, as they watched a number of explorers attempt to reach the frigid destination. As for the real St. Nicholas? He was born in what is now Turkey. A version of this story was published in 2016; it has been updated for 2023."

But what lies beneath this beloved 19th-centuryartworkmight surprise you. Look just right of center. What you might have mistaken for another cresting wave isactuallysnow-cappedMount Fuji, the highest peak in Japan. ThoughHokusaiwas also a painter, theartist—who worked during the Edo period (1603-1868 in Japan)—was best known for his woodblock prints.The Great Wave off Kanagawahas become the most famous of his seriesThirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. Full of vibrant color and compelling use of space, each of these prints depicts the towering peak from a different angle and environment. Mount Fuji is considered sacred by many and has inspireda literal cult following. So a series of portrait prints, easily mass-produced and sold at cheap prices, was a no-brainer. But when tourism to Japan later blossomed, the prints enjoyed a resurgence as part of a booming industry for souvenirs, especially if they depicted its magnificent mountain. Hokusai’sexact agehas been difficult to pin down at the time ofThe Great Wave off Kanagawa’s making, but it’s commonly believed he was in his seventies. He began painting at age 6, and at 14, heservedas an apprentice to a wood-carver. By 18, Hokusai was taking lessons fromukiyo-estyle printmaker Katsukawa Shunshō. Unbeknownst to the young aspiring artist, this path would lead to one of Japan’s most iconic works of art. Because it’s a woodblock print, there are lots ofGreat Wavesto go around, and you can see them inmuseumsacross the globe. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the British Museum of London, the Art Institute of Chicago, LACMA of Los Angeles, Melbourne’s National Gallery of Victoria, and Claude Monet’soft-portrayed homeand garden all boast a print. The Great Wave off Kanagawawas likely printed between 1829 and 1832, but at the time, Japan was not engaging culturally with other nations except for trade with China and Korea (which was strictly controlled) and the Dutch, who were only allowed to operate in Nagasaki. Nearly 30 years would pass before political pressure pushed Japan to open up its ports and exports to foreign nations. In 1859, a wave of Japanese prints flowed across Europe, winning adoration from the likes ofVincent Van Gogh, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, andClaude Monet. The Great Wave off Kanagawarose to such fame that it became adefinitive representationof Japanese art and culture to most of the world. But as art historian Christine Guth of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London,explained to the BBC, “Within Japan, woodblock prints weren’t seen as art, they were seen as a popular form of expression and commercial printing.” Once used for Buddhist text, woodblock prints had become synonymous with illustrations for poems and romance novels. So Japan’s government officials and art historians were less than thrilled that such a seemingly lowbrow art form had come to define them. Hokusai studied European works in addition to Japanese ones and was particularly inspired by the linear perspective used inDutch art. His own variant on this device is evident in the low horizon line, while the European influence is apparent in his use of Prussian blue, a color quite popular on the continent at the time. It’s estimated that 5000 to 8000 prints were made ofThe Great Wave off Kanagawa. Unfortunately, over the course of all this production, the wood blocks used to stamp on colors would break down, and with them the quality of the image. This gradual degradation is why museums will brag about their prints being “early” issues. Though thousands were printed, it’s estimated only hundreds ofThe Great Wave off Kanagawaremain. A specimen’s state determines its value. The first state from Nishimuraya Yohachi publishing featured adistinctive blue outline, while the second had a black outline. In 2015, the former wassaid to fetch$40,000 to $60,000, while the latter would command half that. Even a good replica could score a collector a few grand. In the upper left corner of the print, you'll note a box with writing inside and out. Within the box, Hokusai carved the name of the piece, including its place in theThirty-Six Views of Mount Fujiseries. But to its left he wrote“Hokusai aratame Iitsu hitsu,” which roughlytranslates to“From the brush of Hokusai changing to Iitsu.” Over the course of his career, Hokusai changed his name over 30 times. Today, these different names are used to distinguish the distinctive chapters of his work. French composer Claude Debussy shared the inspiration for his orchestral compositionThe Sea(La Mer)onthe coverof its 1905 edition’s sheet music. There, a sketch fashioned afterThe Great Wave off Kanagawagave music lovers an image to associate with his symphonic sketches. You can listen to it being performed above. Looking upon Hokusai’s ambitious creation, Bohemian-Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke was struck by the diligence that must have gone into its making. And so his poem, “The Mountain,” was born, beginning, “Six and thirty times and hundred times/the painter tried to capture the mountain,/tore it up, then pushed on again/ (six and thirty times and hundred times).” While the wave emojilooks differentdepending on your brand of phone, it’s clear that Apple’s version (which debuted in 2008) wasinspired byHokusai’sGreat Wave. The great might of the wave makes the mountain look minute, and the boats that bob beneath it seem doomed for destruction. Such a suggestion of violence has spurred many to assumeThe Great Wave off Kanagawais atsunami. But scholars Julyan H.E. Cartwright and Hisami Nakamurastudiedthe print and what we know about waves to determine that it’s in fact arogue wave, or, more scientifically, “a plunging breaker.” Rogue waves are alternately known as freak waves, monster waves, or killer waves because they occur abruptly in the open ocean, sometimes toppling ocean liners. This particular rogue wave can actually be measured thanks to the three fishing boats (oshiokuri-bune). Cartwright and Nakamura used their known size to determineThe Great Wave off Kanagawais roughly 32 to 39 feet tall. A version of this story ran in 2015; it has been updated for 2023."

Instead of chucking it in the garbage can with the rest of your trash, consider recycling, upcycling, or responsibly disposing of oldHalloween pumpkinsand helping the environment while doing so. You may have been using it as decoration for the past few weeks, but a Jack-O’-Lantern is still a fruit. Instead of letting it go to waste, set it out for the wildlife in your ecosystem to enjoy. Animals like porcupines, deer, and squirrels all enjoy munching on pumpkins. Just make sure youcut the squashinto bite-sized pieces and don’t scatter them too close to your house if you want to avoid attracting hungry animals to your garden. You can also get crafty and turn the Jack-O’-Lantern into atemporary bird feeder: Just cut the top off the pumpkin, let it dry out, and fill it with seed. Make sure you save and dry the pumpkin seeds, too, as your neighborhood wildlife will enjoy snacking on those as well. No matter how you feed the old pumpkin to your local wildlife, be sure to first check it for mold. Any moldy squash should be tossed in the compost rather than fed to an animal. Don’t have much wildlife in your backyard? Many zoos, farms, and animal sanctuaries acceptpumpkin donationsafter Halloween. Whole pumpkins are not only a nutritious snack, but they can also beenriching toysfor large animals like big cats and bears. Pumpkins arebiodegradable, which makes them great candidates for composting. Even if you don’t have a dedicated compost pile, you can still dispose of old pumpkins naturally in yourhome garden. Just dig out space in the soil, add the pumpkin (either whole or chopped into piece to expedite decomposition), and bury it. Unless you want to see pumpkins growing in your garden next year, remove any extra seeds clinging to the inside before sticking it in the ground. One of the most entertaining ways to dispose of pumpkins also happens to be eco-friendly. If your city or town hosts annualpumpkin smashes, you can get together with people in your community and smash your old Jack-O’-Lanterns into oblivion. When the mayhem winds down, all the pumpkin scraps are collected and composted. A version of this story originally ran in 2019; it has been updated for 2023."
18,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/57094/10-strategies-fighting-wildfires,,"Most Americans know how to stop, drop, and roll. Some even know how to employ a fire suppression blanket and how to properly operate a fire extinguisher. But for the vast majority of people, fire is something you brag about being able to make out of two sticks, or something you cook dinner on top of, or just something you sprint away from—certainly not something you want to have to fight to put out. The people who do run toward an unexpected blaze have been well trained in strategies that can suppress the flames of a wildfire. Below are 10 of the techniques firefighters use to put fires out quickly, completely, and safely. One of the most important components of wildfire suppression,control linesare simply the boundaries—natural or humanmade—that firefighters employ to control how and where a fire spreads. A rocky ridge or river can serve as a natural control line, or firefighters can establish an artificial one by, for example, clearing out an extended line of brush. Within thisoverarching definition, afire lineis when the barrier is scraped down “to mineral soil,” ascratch lineis a preliminary line built in a hurry, and awet lineis when the area has had flame retardant or water applied. And when you hear on the news that a fire is “X percent contained,” this is generally what they’re talking about—that some percentage of the fire’s perimeter has acontrol line. But because fires can sometimes jump the barrier, even a 100 percent contained fire can start up again. When establishing control lines, digging a small ditch and pulling up some plants isn’t always enough. To create a sturdy, fuel-free barrier, firefighters mayuse small torchesto burn the brush just inside a control line. Aburnoutis one of several ways to bolster a control line and further prevent a blaze from escaping the established boundaries. Abackburnis similar to a burnout, but requires a slightly more sophisticated technique. Once a control line is established, firefighters may seta controlled blazedownwind of the main fire, just on the inside of the control line; they then push the new blaze back toward the main fire, burning up all the fuel that lies between the fire and the control line. For a wildfire small enough to be snuffed out using a direct attack, firefighters may begin their assault on the blaze from behind. Starting from already burned earth, the firefighters will typically work their way around the edge of the fire to spray the flames as they make their way around the entire perimeter of the blaze. Hot spottingis the term used to describe the extra attention given to the most active and dangerous portions of a wildfire. The crews fighting the fire size up the parts of the blaze most likely to spread and try to devise the best strategy for keeping these areas in check.Hot spottingmay also involve diverting extra humanpower to the task of stamping out embers and spot fires that blow or erupt from the hottest part of the inferno. Whereas hot spotting refers to the assessment of a fire’s condition,knocking downis all about action. The knock down strategy is employed when firefightersdecide that a certain hotspotneeds to be suppressed immediately. To diminish the section of a fire deemed to have grown too hot, too active, or too large, fighters directly apply some combination of dirt, water, or retardant to that section. While a fire is being attacked from the front or side, other firefighters may be involved incold trailing, the task of combing through already scorched ground in the wake of a moving wildfire. The point is to make sure no hot or glowing embers remain, since leftover coals can be blown around and flame up again. If significant exposed water sources are nearby,planes and helicopterscan scoop up buckets of water and carry them to be dropped atop the inferno. The water is often mixed with a foam retardant before being dropped [PDF]. The foamed water acts as a more effective barrier to the spread of fire and also insulates fuel that has not yet burned. When setting control lines or firelines, firefighters may evenuse explosivesto break up dense brush and fallen trees. Explosives can also be used to fell trees whose spread might help a fire jump across a control line. During a large or fast-moving fire, explosives are employed mainly for efficiency purposes, as they can save precious time when crews need to contain a fire quickly. It’s called amop-upwhen firefighters go back and clean up along a completed control line. Mop-up consists of dousing any embers and spot fires that have made their way across control lines. It also involves protecting still-vulnerable fuels using a burnout (if they’re permanently situated) or by simply moving them. This story originally ran in 2014; it has been updated for 2023."
19,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/504106/7-majestic-facts-about-devils-tower,,"Steven Spielberg fans are likely familiar with Devils Tower, even if they don’t know it by name. The dramatic butte—which towers1267 feetabove the plains of northeastern Wyoming and the Belle Fourche River—was famously featured in 1977’sClose Encounters of the Third Kind, culminating in a scene in which an alien mothership descended upon the rock formation. In the nearly five decades since its release, the film has introduced several generations of fans to the natural landmark—whether they were watching it at home or at a specialscreeningat the base of Devils Tower itself. That said, there’s a lot more to this natural wonder than what you’ve seen on the silver screen. To the Northern Plains Indian Tribes, Devils Tower isn’t just a stunning landmark—it’s asacred place. It appears in multiple oral histories and sacred narratives, and is also known by multiple ancient names. For example, the Arapahoe call Devils Tower “Bear’s Tipi”; the Kiowa refer to it as “Aloft on a Rock” or “Tree Rock”; and the Lakota people know it as “Bear Lodge,” “Bear Lodge Butte,” “Grizzly Bear's Lodge,” “Mythic-owl Mountain,” “Grey Horn Butte,” and “Ghost Mountain.” However, it’s commonly referred to as “Mateo Tepee,” which is likely Sioux for “Bear Wigwam,” or “Bear Lodge.” (Long ago, the surrounding region was home to many bears.) To this day, Devils Tower is frequently the site of ceremonial rituals, including sun dances, sweat lodges, and prayer and artifact offerings. (While visiting the park, make sure not to touch or move any religious artifacts.) Devils Tower received its popular English namein 1875, when Colonel Richard Irving Dodge led geologist Walter P. Jenney’s scientific expedition through the Black Hills region. They were there to confirm claims of gold, first initiated by General George Armstrong Custer. But when they arrived at the rock formation, they were overwhelmed by its natural beauty. Dodge described the landmark as “one of the most remarkable peaks in this or any country.” Dodgerecordedthe butte’s name as “Devils Tower,” writing that the Natives “call this shaft The Bad God’s Tower, a name adopted with proper modification, by our surveyors.” But since so many Native names for the towering formation referenced a bear—plus, Native translations for “Bear Lodge” appeared on early maps of the region—it’s likely that Dodge’s expedition simply mistranslated the landmark’s name. (In the Lakota language, the bad god or evil spirit is calledwakansica, and the word for black bear iswahanksica.) In recent years, Native tribeshave petitionedto officially change the name of Devils Tower to Bear Lodge, as they find the current moniker offensive. Meanwhile, other localsarguethat changing the formation’s name would cause confusion and harm regional tourism. Devils Tower was the very first official United States National Monument. It was proclaimed by President Theodore Roosevelt—whofamously lovedthe American West—onSeptember 24, 1906, shortly after he signed theAntiquities Actinto law. Roosevelt made Dodge’s translation the tower’s official name, but along the way, the apostrophe in “Devil’s Tower” wasdroppeddue to a clerical error. The error was never corrected so, to this day, the tower is simply called “Devils Tower.” Some claim that Devils Tower is an old volcano, butgeologists sayit’s likely an igneous intrusion, meaning it formed underground from molten rock, or magma, that pushed up into sedimentary rock and became solid. Over millions of years, the surrounding sedimentary rock eroded away to display the tall, grayish core within. Experts estimate that the formation of Devils Tower occurred about50 million years ago, whereas the erosion took place between 5 and 10 million years ago. Devils Tower is composed of a rockcalledphonolite porphyry, which is like a less sparkly granite, as it contains no quartz. And while it may appear hollow at a distance, the striated monument is actually solid. (The NPScompares itto “a bunch of pencils held together by gravity.”) Devils Tower isn’t just extremely tall—it’s alsovery wide. Its summit is around 180 feet by 300 feet—roughly the size of a football field—and the circumference of its base is around one mile. Devils Tower is popular among rock climbing enthusiasts, who rely on its manyparallel cracksto shimmy their way to the top. (Long before modern climbing equipment existed, local ranchers simply made do with a wooden ladder.) According to the National Park Service, Devils Tower sees between 5000 and 6000 rock climbers a year. However, the site is closed to climbers each June, as Native American ceremonies are often held during and around the summer solstice. Additionally, some routes are closedeach springto protect nesting prairie or peregrine falcons. A version of this story ran in 2017; it has been updated for 2023."
20,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/89881/15-surprising-facts-about-winter-weather,,"Whether you enjoy bundling up in your coziest gear or are already counting down the days until spring, here are 15 facts about winterweatherto savor while you wait for the return of the sun. You wouldn’t be shocked to seesnowon the ground in Siberia or Minnesota when traveling to those places during the winter months. But northern areas don’t have a monopoly on snowfall—the white stuff has been known to touch down everywhere from theSahara Desertto Hawaii. Even the driest place on Earth isn’t immune: In 2011, the Atacama Desert in Chile receivednearly 32 inchesof snow thanks to a rare cold front from Antarctica. Mostsnowflakesrange from dime-size to the diameter of a human hair. But according to some apocryphal stories, they can grow much larger. Witnesses of a snowstorm in Fort Keogh, Montana, in 1887 claimed to see milk-pan sized crystals fall from the sky. That would make them thelargest snowflakesever spotted, at around 15 inches wide. The air doesn’t need to be super-moist to produce impressive amounts of snow. Unlike plain rainfall, a bank of fluffy snow contains lots of air that adds to its bulk. That’s why what would have been aninch of rainin the summer equals about13 inchesof average snow—or up to 50 inches of super-dry, ski-able powder—in the colder months. If you’ve ever heard the unmistakable rumble of thunder in the middle of a snowstorm, that’s not your ears playing tricks on you. It’s likelythundersnow, a rare winter weather phenomenon that’s most common near lakes. When columns of warm air rise from the ground and form turbulent storm clouds in the sky in the winter, there’s potential for thundersnow. A few more factors are still necessary for it to occur—namely, that the air is warmer than the cloud cover above it, and that wind pushes the warm air upwards. Even then it’s entirely possible to miss thundersnow when it happens right over your head: Lightning is harder to see in the winter and the snow sometimes dampens the thunderous sound. At least in the case of snowflakes with broad structures, which act like parachutes to slow the descent.Graupel, a form of pellet-like icy snow, travels to Earth at a much faster rate. Weather records in Rapid City, South Dakota, show just how dramaticallytemperatures can plummet. November 10, 1911, started out at a pleasant 55°F at 6 a.m., then a wicked cold front brought the temperature down to 3°F by 8 a.m. The front caused outbreaks of violent tornadoes across the midwest. One of the largest drops over a short period of time took place on January 23-24, 1916, in Browning, Montana, where the mercury dove from 44°F to -56°F in less than 24 hours. In Fairfield, Montana, the temp on December 24, 1924, dropped from 63°F to -21°F in less than 12 hours. Every January (the winterseasonin the Northern Hemisphere), Earth reaches perihelion, the point in its orbit that’s nearest to the sun. Despite some common misconceptions, the seasonal drop in temperature has nothing to do with the distance of our planet to the sun. Instead, it relates to the direction Earth’s axis is tilting, which is why the two hemispheres experience winter at different times of the year. According to the Lake Champlain Sea Grant, that’s enough to fill a line of dump trucks extending8333 miles. Aomori City in northern Japan receives more snowfall than any major city on the planet. Each year citizens are pummeled with312 inches, or about 26 feet, of snow on average. Something strange happened in 2016 in northwest Siberia: Mysterious, giantsnowballsbegan washing up on a beach along the Gulf of Ob. It turns out the ice orbs were formed naturally by the rolling motions of wind and water. You wouldn’t want to use this frozen ammunition in a snowball fight—some spheres reached nearly 3 feet in diameter When the meteorologist reports a “real feel” temperature of -10° outside, it may sound like they’re coming up with that number on the spot. But wind chill is actuallycalculatedusing a complicated equation combining temperature and wind speed. For math nerds who’d like to test it at home, the formula reads:Wind Chill = 35.74 + 0.6215T – 35.75(V^0.16) + 0.4275T(V^0.16). When snow piles up too high for cities to manage, it’s usually hauled away to parking lots or other open spaces where it can sit until the weather warms up. During particularly snowy seasons, cities are sometimes forced to dump snow in the ocean. Some cities employ snow melters that use hot water to melt 30 to 50 tons of snow an hour. This method is quick but costly—a single machine can cost $200,000 and burn 60 gallons of fuel in an hour of use. Physics confirms what you’ve likely known since childhood: Snow on the wet or moist side is best for building your own backyardFrosty. One scientist pegs the perfect snow-to-water ratio at 5:1. Snow crystals usually form unique patterns, but there’s at least one instance of identical snowflakes in the record books. In 1988, two snowflakes collected from a Wisconsin storm were confirmed to be twins at an atmospheric research center in Colorado. Freezing rain and sleetcan both have scary effects on driving conditions, but their formations differ in some key ways. Both types of precipitation occur when rain formed in warm air in the sky passes through a layer of cold air near the ground. Thicker layers of cold air create sleet, a slushy form of water that’s semi-frozen by the time it reaches the Earth. Thinner layers don’t give rain enough time to freeze until it hits the surface of the ground—it then forms a thin coat of ice wherever it lands.

From aboard whaling ships camescrimshaw, a folk art tradition that turned  whale teeth and bones into intricate carved objects. Whalers etched detailed scenes of maritime life, the exciting chases for their prey, and portraits of their sweethearts, presidents, and family members on sperm whale teeth. (Now, sperm whales are a protectedendangered speciesand it’s illegal topossess or selltheir parts; scrimshanders today carvereplica teethmade out of resin.) Sailors also collected delicate seashells from their voyages around the South Pacific and made “sailors’ valentines.” The shells were glued in a colorful arrangement inside an octagonal frame and given as gifts to sweethearts upon the mariners’ return from their voyages. Historians have also uncovered clues suggesting that many sailors’ valentines were likelyproduced by womenin Barbados and purchased by American sailors just before arriving home. These incredible artifacts are stunning souvenirs, but they’re not exactly sustainable or environmentally conscious. The design incubatorStudio Swine, however, has paid homage to this maritime tradition by repurposing old trash pulled from the ocean to create similar works of art. Even out in the middle of the ocean—where the closest other people might be the ones in orbit—human-made plastic abounds. It’s difficult to assess the total amount of plastic of every size and type in the oceans, but a 2015studyin the journalScienceestimated that in just the year 2010, roughly8 million metric tonsentered seas around the world. For a project called Gyrecraft, a team from Studio Swine collected a fraction of this plastic and melted it down to a malleable medium using their on-board solar extruder. Check out the mini-documentary on the project from National Geographic above. A version of this story was published in 2015; it has been updated for 2023."
22,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76800/5-severe-weather-terms-know-spring-storms-near,,"We’re approaching the end of winter and the inevitable climb towardsummer. The annual ritual of warmth flushing out the cold makes the atmosphere pretty restless, allowing dangerous storms to bubble up on a regular basis. It’s critically important for everyone to know what to do when badweatherstrikes, and staying safe begins with knowing the six termsmeteorologistsuse most often to describe life-threatening weather. The defining type ofspringweather in the United States is severethunderstorms. A severe thunderstorm is one that produces hail the size of quarters or larger, wind gusts that reach 58 mph or stronger, or atornado. Severe thunderstorms can seriously injure or kill you if you’re caught outside during one, or if you’re in a building that can’t withstand the fierce winds or damaging hail. After all, the wind gusts within a severe thunderstorm can cause as much damage as a tornado.Hailis no laughing matter, either—even small pieces can easily shatter windows, especially when it falls during strong winds. Tornadoesare the best-known type of severe weather. These destructive forces can range in shape from a thin rope to a wedge that consumes the landscape. Most tornadoes are small and don’t cause much damage, but a handful of tornadoes every year are strong enough to level entire neighborhoods. One of the most dangerous things about a tornado is that you can’t alwayssee one coming. We can see tornadoes because of the condensation funnel, or the cloud that forms as a result of the low pressure within the rotating column of air. Some tornadoes—especially when they just start to form—don’t have that condensation funnel, making them hard to spot until it’s too late. To make matters worse, many tornadoes that form in humid areas are often wrapped in heavy rain, making one impossible to see until it’s right on top of you. One of the most common terms you’ll hear during the spring and summer iswatch, either a severe thunderstorm watch or a tornado watch. A watch means that conditions are favorable for dangerous thunderstorms to develop over the next couple of hours, and they’re issued to give people as muchtimeas possible to seek safety. If you’re ever placed under a watch, it means that you should keep an eye out for urgent weather updates through the day. Severe thunderstorm and tornado watches are issued for wide areas on a county basis, sometimes covering entire states. You should always know what county you’re in and what counties surround you—it could save your life one day. Where we’re talking about severe weather, an advisory ismore urgentthan a watch but not as urgent as a warning. They’re issued for less dangerous conditions that may cause disruption or inconvenience if people aren’t adequately prepared. In spring, you may hear of advisories issued forhigh winds, dense fog, or potential flooding. A warning is an urgent alert that means your immediate safety is at risk. When a severe thunderstorm develops, meteorologists at the National Weather Service will issue a severe thunderstorm warning that tells you about the imminent arrival of large hail or damaging winds. A tornado warning means that meteorologists detect rotation in a thunderstorm or that someone has spotted a tornado on the ground. Warnings are issued ahead of individual storms using polygons on a map that cover areas most likely to see dangerous weather. Most severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings are issued 15 to 30 minutes before the storm arrives, but sometimes there’s little or no warning ahead of time. If you’re ever placed under a warning, you have to act quickly to protect your life. Sometimes when a large tornado is barreling toward a city, the National Weather Service will issue an extremely rare “tornado emergency” instead of a tornado warning. The enhanced language is designed to drive home the point that you need to seek safety, stat. TheStorm Prediction Center(SPC) is a branch of theNational Weather Servicethat’s devoted to predicting severe thunderstorms. The agency issues thunderstormforecastsup to seven days out. The risk for severe weather is conveyed using a five-category scale that ranges in severity from “marginal risk” to “high risk.” Days featuring a high risk—a 5 on the scale—are extremely rare, saved for the worst severe weather outbreaks that could produce widespread destruction and claim dozens if not hundreds of lives. You should check the SPC at least once a day during severe weather season, and more often if hazardous weather is on your doorstep. A version of this story ran in 2016; it has been updated for 2023."
23,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/575847/leave-cap-on-plastic-bottle-before-recycling,,"Before you toss another empty plastic bottle into the recycling bin in your kitchen, you might want to make sure the cap is still attached. AsLifehackerpoints out, when you remove the cap from a plastic bottle, “you’ve essentially thrown it right in the garbage.” This advice seems to go against everything we’ve been taught in the past. It’s true that bottles and caps are typically made of different kinds of plastic—and that used to pose problems at recycling plants. “In the past the plastics recycling industry was not able to effectively recycle bottles with caps on so the message to remove the cap was created,” the Association of Plastic Recyclers explains on its website [PDF]. Recycling technologies have improved since then, and keeping the lid on is no longer an issue. Essentially, the two components are separated naturally in a process referred to as a water bath. The bottles float and the caps sink, making it easy to separate the two materials. On the other hand, removing the caps can cause them to be improperly sorted early on in the recycling process. Because of their small size, individual caps are often sorted into piles of landfill-bound waste. They are also common ocean pollutants, and can seriously harm marine life if they are ingested. By someestimates, 5 billion plastic caps pollute the environment in California alone each year. It’s also common for people to crush plastic bottles before placing them in the bin, but that shouldalso be avoided. That’s because they could be confused for paper during the sorting process and end up in the wrong place (at least that's the case if your communityusesa single-stream recycling program, in which everything set to be recycledends up in the same bin). “Retaining a 3D form can help containers be successfully sorted,” according to The Association of Plastic Recyclers. In summary: Dump out any liquids left inside the bottle, replace the cap, and toss it in the recycling bin—but be sure to check with your individual recycling program to see if there are any exceptions to the rule. Now that you know to keep those lids on plastic bottles, check out things you probablydidn’t know you could recycle, or somecommon misconceptions about recycling.

24,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/576229/cherry-blossoms-facts,,"Cherry blossom season is a majortourist drawfor any city that’s lucky enough to grow abundant ornamental cherry trees: Millions of people travel to cherry blossom festivals around the world to admire the beautiful pinkblooms. In celebration of thearrival of spring, here are 10 things you might not know about the trees that produce such picturesque petals. Calledsakurain Japan, the cherry blossoms of Yoshino and Kyoto are world-famous. Tourists flock to the country each spring to try their hand at a centuries-old activity calledhanami, or “flower viewing.” You don’t have to fly to Japan to see them, though. In the U.S., the cherry blossoms ofWashington, D.C., New York City, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Seattle, San Francisco, and Boston are all beautiful in their own way. The flowers can also be viewed in many European and Asian countries, as well as Brazil and Australia in the Southern Hemisphere. Believe it or not, the city of Macon in central Georgiais recognizedas the “Cherry Blossom Capital of the World”—at least according to U.S. congressional records. It’s home to 350,000 Yoshino cherry trees, whileWashington, D.C., has fewer than 4000 trees. Those who organize the two cities’ respective cherry blossom festivals have engaged in some playful competition over the years. In 1987, representatives of the Macon festival sent army helmets to TV stations in D.C. “to dramatize the rivalry,” according to an article published at the time inThe Record. Representatives in D.C. played it cool, with one spokesperson for the National Park Service stating, “I’m sure they have much more than we have here, but we’re still proud of our celebration.” Japan in particular is home to hundreds of types of cherry tree—possibly more than 600, by liberal estimates. Some types bear fruit, while others don’t. The flowers of many trees change from dark pink to light pink to white throughout the different stages of blossoming, while others progress from greenish yellow to white to pink. One variety, called Kanzan, was bred to have “double blossoms”—or up to 28 petals on each flower, compared to the Yoshino tree’s five petals. A cherry tree might only remain in bloom for one to two weeks. However, they keep up their “peak color” for only about three days, so it’s best to time your trip wisely if you’re visiting a cherry blossom destination from out of town. The timing depends on a number of factors, including location, temperature, and daylight. In D.C., the florets typically start to appear in March, and peak bloom (when 70 percent of the flowers have blossomed) generally occurs in late March or early April. Some experts havesuggestedthat the trees are blooming earlier and earlier as the planet gradually gets warmer. Dr. Soo-Hyung Kim, an ecophysiologist at the University of Washington who has studied the phenomenon,saysthat by 2080 we could expect to see cherry blossoms in D.C. as early as February. In 2021, Japan’s cherry blossoms peaked on March 26—the earliest they had peaked in1200 years. D.C.’s trees also bloomedunusually early. Resist the urge to take a cherry blossom home with you as a souvenir. In D.C. at least, breaking off a blossom or branch isviewedas vandalism of federal property. Those who break this rule could receive a citation, or worse, be arrested. (Usually, law enforcement officers prefer to issue warnings or small fines.) It goes without saying that it’s also illegal to climb the trees. If they sustain damage to their branches, they will never be able togrownew blossoms on that particular bough again. Basically,don’t even touch them. In 1909, Japan offered to send 2000 cherry trees to America as a symbol of friendship between the two countries. After all, just a few years earlier, PresidentTeddy Roosevelthad helped Japan negotiate an end to the Russo-Japanese War. Despite the good intentions, the execution was disastrous. When the trees arrived in D.C. in January 1910, the trees were weak—due to overpruning of their roots—and they were also infested with wood-boring insects. Despite attempts to save them, the trees were ultimately thrown in a pile andburned. Everyone was pretty embarrassed about the whole ordeal, but Tokyo mayor Yukio Ozaki made a joke to ease some of the tension. “To be honest about it, it has been an American tradition to destroy cherry trees ever since your first president,George Washington,” hesaid. “So there’s nothing to worry about. In fact, you should be feeling proud.” (Washington’s cherry tree story turned out to beuntrue, but we digress.) Another shipment of trees was sent, and by 1912, the healthy trees were successfully planted in D.C. by then-first lady Helen Taft. Located in the largest park in the Netherlands, all 400 cherry blossom treeshave proper names. Half of them have traditional Dutch women’s names, and the other half have Japanese women’s names. The Japan Women’s Club gifted the trees in 2000, and you can now find them at Amsterdamse Bos (Amsterdam Forest) in the Amstelveen municipality. In Japan, no part of the cherry tree goes to waste. The preserved leaves are used as edible wrappers for mochi (a rice cake filled with sweet bean paste), and a number of seasonal snacks feature sakura as a key ingredient. Sakura-infused versions ofPepsi, Coke, tea, and even Starbucks lattes are all popular drinks. You can also find two varieties ofKit Kats—sakura and roasted soy bean, and sakura sake—as well as Pocky snack sticks that taste like sakura andmatcha(green tea). So what do cherry blossoms taste like? They have a “light, flowery, slightly cherry flavor,” according to Gabe Perez, social media director atJapan Crate, a subscription box service that ships many of the aforementionedsnacks, plus other Japanese products, to customers. LEGOLAND Japan, a theme park in Nagoya,seta Guinness World Record in 2018 for the largest LEGO brick cherry blossom tree ever made (although we’re not sure how much competition they had). The tree stood 14 feet tall, weighed over 7000 pounds, and consisted of more than 800,000 LEGO bricks. A version of this story ran in 2019; it has been updated for 2023."

Defined as a wave caused by a disturbance like anearthquake, landslide, or volcanic eruption, tsunamis often reach just a few inches in height, according to NOAA. But when the inciting event is strong enough, the results can be disastrous. The most powerful tsunamis move as fast asjet planesacross the open ocean and grow as tall as skyscrapers. When they reach land, they can decimateentire townsin minutes. The tsunamis on this list aren’t necessarily the deadliest or most destructive, but they do dominate one category: sheer magnitude. Here are thetallest megatsunamisever recorded. Greenlandrarelysees tsunamis, but it was hit by one of the biggest waves on record in 2017. A landslide on Karrat Fjord sent a295-foot-tallwall of water into the fishing village of Nuugaatsiaq on June 17. The megatsunami killedfour peopleand swept 11 buildings into the ocean. Experts believe the event was triggered by awarming climatethawing the glacial landscape. The mountains surrounding Karrat Fjord are still unstable, andan evenbigger landslide-caused tsunami could be in Greenland's future. The first megatsunami to bedocumented in detailin Indonesia remains one of the largest tsunamis on record. On February 17, 1674, an earthquake struck the Maluku Islands in the Banda Sea. The seismic event sent a massive wave crashing into Ambon Island, where it killed more than 2000 people. The water reached the top of thecoastal hillson the Hitu Peninsula, indicating the tsunami peaked around 328 feet. This megatsunami that hit the T-shaped fjord on the southeastern edge of Alaska was likely caused by a landslide. Tree ring counts show it occurring in late 1853 or early 1854, and trimlines [PDF] (the point in the valley where trees were wiped away) indicate a maximum height of 394 feet. Lituya Bay has been the site of multiple megastunamis throughout history. Itssteep wallsand proximity to theFairweather fault lineare a recipe for destructive waves.

Eyewitnesses described three giant waves rolling in from Crillon Inlet one after the other at speeds around 22 mph [PDF]. The largest wave topped out at around 490 feet. Experts still aren’t sure what caused the 1936 tsunami, but an underwater rockslide is one possible culprit. The remote fjord ofIcy Bay, Alaska, saw a historic megatsunami on October 17, 2015. Following a landslide, the 633-foot wave cleared 8 square miles of forest from Wrangell St.-Elias National Park and Preserve. Fortunately, no humans were close enough to be impacted by the event. Like Lituya Bay, Icy Bay features steep walls carved out by a retreating glacier, which contributed to the tsunami’s intensity. Unlike other tsunamis on this list, this disaster was caused by humans. The construction of theVajont damin northern Italy—the highest dam of its kind at the time of completion in 1960—disturbed the surrounding landscape. The face of nearby Mount Toc showed signs of cracking early on, and onOctober 9, 1963, the entire slope crumbled into the reservoir below. The landslide triggered a tsunami that wiped out several villages in the Piave valley within 15 minutes. More than 2000 lives were claimed in the tragedy. Reaching 771 feet tall, the Vajont dam tsunami is among history’s biggest in addition to being one of the deadliest man-made environmental disasters ever. The earthquake that caused the infamousMount. St. Helenseruption in Washington on May 18, 1980, also resulted in a tsunami. When the quake struck, the north side of the volcano broke apart and fell intoSpirit Lake. Thelandslideremains the largest on record, and the 820-foot tsunami that followed is the third-largest in history. It crashed into the side of Mount Margaret before splashing back down into the basin below. On July 9, 1958, Alaska’s Lituya Bay was hit by the largest megatsunami ever recorded. It occurred when a7.8 magnitude earthquakestruck the Fairweather fault, dislodging 90 million tons of rock into the bay. The wall of water this produced reached nearly 1720 feet in the air—which is higher than theWillis Towerin Chicago.Five peoplewere killed by the wave, included three people on the shore of Khantaak Island at Yakutat Bay’s entrance and two people on a boat in Lituya Bay.

26,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/78560/10-fascinating-facts-about-earth-day,,"Every year on April 22, trees are planted, litter is cleaned up, and people call attention to the issues plaguing the planet—including climate change. In honor of the holiday, which is celebrating its 53nd anniversary in 2023, we’ve gathered together 10 fascinating facts about Earth Day. Senator Gaylord Nelson arrived in Washington in 1963 looking to make the fledgling conservation movement—sparked in part byRachel Carson’sNew York TimesbestsellerSilent Spring, which warned against the harmful effects ofwidespread pesticideuse—a part of the national discourse. After witnessing the aftermath of anoil spill in California in 1969, Nelson doubled down on his commitment to raising environmental awareness. Drawing inspiration from the energetic anti-Vietnam War movement of the time, he enlisted support from both sides of the aisle, and on April 22, 1970, Earth Day was born. In 1963, Nelson proposed a “conservation tour” to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Arthur Schlesinger, a member of President Kennedy’s “best and brightest” cabinet. Schlesinger privately endorsed the idea to the president, while Nelson wrote a direct memo to Kennedy, a bold move for a freshman senator from Wisconsin. Kennedy, however, was receptive, and on September 24, 1963, JFK embarked on a conservation-themed multi-state tour. The president, accompanied by Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, as well as Nelson and a few additional senators, visited 11 states in five days. Nelson was disappointed in the president’s speeches,sayingthey “didn’t have much sweep or drama to them.” In addition, members of the press ignored environmental issues and instead focused their questions on the tense nuclear situation with the Soviet Union. It would be another seven years until Earth Day became a reality. The first Earth Day marked a strange combination of boisterous rallies and sober reflection on the state of the planet. Protests, demonstrations, fundraisers, nature walks, speeches, concerts, and every sort of civic gathering imaginable took place at colleges, VFW halls, public squares, and parks across the United States on April 22, 1970. Environmental crusaders found themselvesthrust into the limelight, and pop culture icons like poet Allen Ginsberg were asked to speak on behalf of Mother Earth. Some of the more colorful displays of the day included mock trials for polluting objects, like an old Chevrolet, which was sentenced to death by sledgehammer. (The car ultimately survived the beating and was donated to an art class.) In New York City, Earth Day celebrationseffectively shut downparts of the city. Twenty thousand people packed into Union Square to seePaul Newmanand hear a speech by Mayor John Lindsay, who arrived on an electric bus. To head up the Earth Day project, Senator Nelson enlistedDenis Hayes, then a graduate student at Harvard University. As national coordinator, Hayes recruited a staff of 85 energetic young environmental crusaders and grassroots organizers, along with thousands of field volunteers, in order to promote the fledgling holiday across the nation. The team knew that in order to gain the most traction, college students would need to play acentral role, as they did in the Vietnam protests of the era. The date that Hayes selected for the first Earth Day was acalculated choice: April 22 on most college campuses falls right between spring break and final exams. According to Grist, the first Earth Day faced staunch opposition from conservative groups like the John Birch Society, which claimed that the event was a thinly veiled attempt to honor the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vladimir Lenin. In addition to detractors on the far right of the political spectrum, bleeding-heart environmental crusaders weren’t satisfied, either. Earth Day, they claimed, simply served as a distraction from the more pressing social issues of the day. Journalist I.F. Stone said, “the country is slipping into a wider war in Southeast Asia and we’re sitting here talking about litterbugs.” Critics of the holiday also point to the trend of “greenwashing,” an attempt by corporations with poor environmental track records to appear conscientious if only once a year. With bipartisan support in Congress and thousands of civic demonstrations across the country, support for environmental reform in 1970 was undeniable.According to the EPA, “Public opinion polls indicate that a permanent change in national priorities followed Earth Day 1970. When polled in May 1971, 25 percent of the U.S. public declared protecting the environment to be an important goal, a 2500 percent increase over 1969.” The 1970s saw the passage of the most comprehensive environmental legislation in U.S. history, including the Clean Air Act, the Water Quality Improvement Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. In addition, just eight months after the first Earth Day, Richard Nixon approved the creation of a new organization tasked with monitoring the nation’s natural assets: the Environmental Protection Agency. In 1990,Earth Day expandedto include countries and peoples across the globe, with 200 million people in 141 nations getting involved. A decade later, at the turn of the new millennium, Earth Day shed light on the emerging clean energy movement and expanded its reach, spreading to 184 countries with the help of 5000 environmental organizations. Global activities included a massive traveling drum chain in the African nation of Gabon and an unprecedented gathering of hundreds of thousands of concerned citizens at the National Mall in Washington, D.C.According to Earth Day Network, after 40 years, more than 1 billion people participate in Earth Day activities, making it the largest secular civic event in the world. Earth Day is now observed around the world, albeit under a different name: In 2009, the United Nations General Assemblydecided to designateApril 22 as International Mother Earth Day. The symbol of Mother Earth serves as a common metaphor and representation of our planet in many countries and cultures. In the United States, the holiday is still commonly referred to as Earth Day. During theApollo 14moon missionin 1971, astronaut Stuart Roosa brought with him hundreds of seeds from loblolly pine, sycamore, sweetgum, redwood, and Douglas fir trees. Roosa was a former smoke jumper for the U.S. Forest Service, and he transported the seeds in his personal effects as a tribute to his former employer. Roosa and his seeds orbited the moon 34 times in the command moduleKitty Hawk.Scientists were curiouswhether exposure to the microgravity of space would impact the growth of these seeds when returned to Earth. The experiment seemed like a lost cause when, during the post-mission decontamination process, the seed canisters broke open and the seeds were thought to be useless. However, most of the tree seeds were still fit for germination and were successfully planted and cultivated. These trees were planted around national monuments and in sites all over the country. After decades of growing side-by-side with their Earth cousins, the moon trees showed no differences at all. On Earth Day 2009, NASA, in partnership with the United States National Arboretum and American Forests, planted a second generation moon sycamore on the arboretum’s grounds in Washington, D.C. Every year since Earth Day 2016, there has been a new theme attached to the holiday. In 2016,it was“Trees for the Earth,” followed by “Environmental and Climate Literacy”in 2017, “End Plastic Pollution”in 2018, and “Protect Our Species”in 2019. This year, Earth Day celebrants will adopt “Invest in Our Planet” as the guiding idea. Organizers are hopeful that this will be a day to raise awareness of both the dangers of climate change and the opportunities people have to ensure a green future.

27,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/519659/25-species-have-made-amazing-comebacks,,"Conservationists can’t afford to become complacent. When it comes to rescuing endangered species, progress is an ongoing effort. Still, we can take comfort in the knowledge that many organisms once on the brink of extinction or endangerment have made tremendous comebacks with our help. Just look at what happened to these 25 plants and animals. For much of the 20th century, thisAmerican iconwas in jeopardy. Habitat loss, hunting, and the widespread use of DDT—an insecticide that weakens avian eggshells—once took a major toll on bald eagles. By 1963,the speciespopulation in the lower 48 states had fallen from an estimated 100,000 individuals to just 417 wild pairs. To turn things around, the U.S. government passed a series of laws, including a 1973 ban on DDT that was implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These efforts paid off; today, there are more than71,400 nesting pairsin the lower 48. The Arabian oryx is a desert antelope indigenous to the Middle East. Reckless hunting devastated the species, which became essentially extinct in the wild during the early 1970s. But a few were still alive and well in captivity, so, in the 1980s, American zoos joined forces with conservationists in Jordan to launch a massivebreeding program. Thanks to their efforts, the oryx was successfully reintroduced to the Arabian Peninsula, whereover 1000wild specimens now roam (with a captive population of about 7000). Even well-known conservationists likeTheodore Rooseveltused to vilify America’s wolves. Decades of bounty programs intended to cut their numbers down to size worked all too well; by 1965, only300 gray wolvesremained in the lower 48 states, and those survivors were all confined to remote portions of Michigan and Minnesota. Later, the Endangered Species Act enabled the canids to bounce back in a big way. Now, about5500 of themroam the contiguous states. Louisiana’s state bird, the brown pelican, is another avian species that was brought down by DDT. In 1938, a census reported that there were 500 pairs living in Louisiana. But after farmers embraced DDT in the 1950s and 1960s, these once-common birdsgrew scarce. Things got so bad that, when a 1963 census was conducted, not a single brown pelican had been sighted anywhere in Louisiana. Fortunately, now that the era of DDT is over, the pelican is back with a vengeance on the Gulf Coast and no longer considered endangered. Noted for its yellow flowers, Robbins’s cinquefoil (Potentilla robbinsiana)is an attractive, perennial plant that’s only found inNew Hampshire’s White Mountains and Franconia Ridge. Collectors once harvested the cinquefoil in excessive numbers and careless backpackers trampled many more to death. In response, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Servicere-routed hiking trailsaway from the flower’s wild habitats. This, along with a breeding program, rescued the Robbins’ cinquefoil from the brink of extinction. With its population sitting at an all-time low, the Americanalligatorwas recognized as an endangered species in 1967. Working together, the Fish and Wildlife Service and governments of the southern states took a hard line against gator hunting while also keeping tabs on free-rangingalligatorpopulations. In 1987, it was announced that the species had made a full recovery [PDF]. Due to its oil-rich blubber, the northern elephant seal became a prime target for commercial hunters. By 1892, some people were beginning to assume that it had gone extinct. However, in 1910, it was discovered that a small group—consisting of fewer than 100 seals—remained on Guadalupe Island. In 1922, Mexico turned the landmass into a government-protected biological preserve. From a place of security, that handful of pinnipeds bred like mad. Today, every single one of the160,000living northern elephant seals on Earth are that once-small group’sdescendants. Did you know that the world’shumpback whalepopulation is divided into 14 geographically defined segments? Well, it is—and in 2016, the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) informed the press thatnine of those clustersare doing so well that they no longer require protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. The cetaceans’ comeback is a huge win for the International Whaling Commission, which responded to dwindling whale numbers by enacting acommercial hunting moratorium. Commercial whaling decimated global populations of fin whales, thesecond-largestspecies of baleen whale on Earth. In the 1970s, international coalitions banned commercial fin whale hunting in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Pacific, and legal catches were reduced in the North Atlantic in the 1990. Though three countries—Norway, Iceland, andJapan—continue to hunt whales for oil and meat, the IUCNreported in2018 that the fin whale population has doubled since the 1970s. Make no mistake: The long-term survival of Earth’s largest living rhino is still very uncertain because poachers continue to slaughter them en masse. Nevertheless, there is some good news. Like black-footed ferrets and northern elephant seals, white rhinos were once presumed to be extinct. But in 1895, just under 100 of them were unexpectedly found in South Africa. Thanks to environmental regulations and breeding efforts,more than 20,000are now at large. It’s hard to imagine thatthese birdswere ever in any real trouble, and yet they looked destined for extinction in the early 20th century. With no hunting regulations to protect them, and frontiersmen decimating their natural habitat, wild turkeysdisappearedfrom several states. By the 1930s, there were reportedlyfewer than 30,000left in the American wilderness. Now, over6 millionare strutting around. So what changed? Acombinationof bag limits set by various agencies and an increase in available shrublands. North America’s only indigenous ferret is a prairie dog-eater that waswritten offas “extinct” in 1979. But the story of this animal took a surprising twist two years later, when a Wyoming dog gave a freshly dead one to its owner. Amazed by the canine’s find, naturalists soon located a wild colony. Some of these ferrets were then inducted into a breeding program, which helped bring the species’ total population up to over 1000. Since 1987, the total number of California condors hasgone upfrom 27 birds to about 560, with 347 of those being wild animals (according to2022 data). With its 10-foot wingspan, this is the largest flying land bird in North America. A flashy orange primate from Brazil’sAtlantic Forest, the golden lion tamarin has been struggling to cope with habitat destruction. The species hit rock-bottom in the early 1970s, whenfewer than 200remained in the wild. A helping hand came from the combined efforts of Brazil’s government, the World Wildlife Federation, public charities, and150 zoosaround the world. There’s now a healthy population of captive tamarins tended to by zookeepers all over the globe. Meanwhile, breeding, relocation, and reintroduction campaigns have increased the number of wild specimens toaround 2500—althoughurban sprawlcould threaten the species with another setback. But at least the animal doesn’t have a PR problem: Golden lion tamarins are so well-liked that the image of one appears on a Brazilian banknote. Native to three of California’s Channel Islands, this omnivorous,4-inch reptilewas granted federal protection under the Endangered Species Act in 1977. The designation couldn’t have come at a better time, as introduced goats and pigs were decimating the night lizard’s wild habitat in those days. But now that wild plants have been reestablished under FWS guidance, more than21 millionof the reptiles are believed to be living on the islands. Small, flightless, island birds usually don’t fare well when invasive predators arrive from overseas. (Just askthe dodo.) New Zealanders take great pride in the five kiwi species found exclusively in their country, including the Okarito kiwi, which is also known as the Okarito brown or rowi kiwi. These animals have historically suffered at the hands of introduced dogs and stoats. But recently, there’s been some cause for celebration. Although there were only about 150 Okarito kiwis left in the mid-1990s, conservation initiatives have triggered a minor population boom, withabout 450adult birds now wandering about. Taking note of this trend, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)has declaredthat the Okarito kiwi is no longer endangered. Let’s clear something up: The famous grizzly bear technically isn’t its own species. Instead, it’s a North Americansubspeciesof the brown bear (Ursus arctos), which also lives in Eurasia. Still, grizzlies are worth mentioning here because of just how far they’ve come within the confines of Yellowstone National Park. In 1975, there were only 136 of them living inside the park. Today,approximately 1063of them call the area home. In 2017, the FWSdelistedthe Greater Yellowstone population grizzlies from Endangered Species Act protection, but reinstated them in 2018 as “threatened“ to comply with a Montana court ruling. With pads that can be as tiny asa centimeter across, the thermal water lily is the world’s smallest water lily. Discovered in 1985, it was only known to grow in Mashyuza, Rwanda, where it grew in the damp mud surrounding the area’s hot spring. Or at least it did. The thermal water lily seems to have disappeared from its native range. Fortunately, before the species went extinct in the wild, some seeds and seedlings were sent to London’s Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. There, horticulturalists figured out a way to make the lilies flower in captivity, and managed to saved the species. When aperegrine falcondives toward its airborne prey, the bird-eating raptor has been known to hit speeds of up to242 mph. The species endured a plummet of a different sort when DDT dropped its population. In the first few decades of the 20th century, there were around 3900 breeding pairs in the United States. By 1975, the number of known pairs had beenwhittled down to 324. Things got better after the insecticide was banned, and according to the American Bird Conservancy, there are now roughly40,000 peregrine falconinNorth America. There are a few different subspecies of wild horse, all of whichare endangered. One variant is the Przewalski’s horse (Equus ferus perzewalskii) from Mongolia. It completely vanished from that nation during the 1950s, but by thenassorted zoosaround the world had started breeding them. From 1992 to 2004, some 90 captive-born horses were released into Mongolia, where they thrived. Other populations have been successfully introduced in Hungary and Russia (including in theChernobyl exclusion zone); there areabout 1400of the horses alive today. According to some estimates, there werehundreds of millionsof these buck-toothed rodents living on North America before European fur traders showed up. But after two centuries of over-trapping, spurred by the lucrative pelt trade, the number of North American beavershad shrunkto an abysmal 100,000 in 1900. Their fortunes reversed when restocking programs were implemented in the U.S. and Canada. Nowadays, somewhere between 10 and15 million beaverslive in those countries. Thanks to beaver’s amazing landscaping talents, many property owners have come to see them (unfairly) as pests. Rodrigues Island in the Indian Ocean once gave biologists a chance to raise the (near) dead. This landmass is the home of a small tree with star-shaped flowers called the café marron. It was thought that the plant had long since died out when a single specimen wasfound by a schoolboynamed Hedley Manan in 1980. As the only surviving member of its species known to humankind, that lone plant assumed paramount importance. Cuttings from the isolated café marron were used to grow new trees at England’s Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew. Right now, there are more than 50 of these plants—and all of them can have their ancestry traced straight back to that one holdout tree. A docile, slow-moving marine mammal with a taste for sea grasses, the Floridian subspecies of the West Indian manatee is a creature that does not react well to razor-sharp propellers. Collisions with boats are a significant threat, and the danger won’t go away altogether. The passage of tighter boating regulations has helped the Sunshine State rejuvenate its manatee population, which hasmore than tripledsince 1991. However, the species isn't out of the woods yet. Their numbersdeclined sharplyin recent years fromstarvationcaused by a drastic sea grass die-off, though the number of deaths has slowed this past year thanks to a feeding program and sea grass regrowth. The pet trade did a number on these guys. Beginning in the 1990s, wildlife traffickers harvested Burmese star tortoises until they effectively became “ecologically extinct” in their native Myanmar. Luckily, conservationists had the foresight to set up breeding colonies with specimens who’d been confiscated from smugglers. The program started out with fewer than 200 tortoises in 2004; today, it hasmore than 14,000of them. “Our ultimate objective is to have about 100,000 star tortoises in the wild,” Steve Platt, a herpetologist who’s been taking part in the initiative, said in the Wildlife Conservation Society video above. Here we have it: theposter childfor endangered animals everywhere … except that the giant panda isno longer endangered. In 2016, the IUCN changed its status from “endangered” to “vulnerable.” There’s still a chance that we could lose the majestic bamboo-eater once and for all someday, but the last few years have offered a bit of hope. Between 2004 and 2014, the number of wild pandas increased 17 percent. The welcome development was made possible by enacting a poaching ban and establishing new panda reserves. It’s nice to know that, with the right environmental policies, we can make the future brighter for some of our fellow creatures.

Committing to going greener doesn’t have to mean a 10-mile walk to work or abiding by “if it’s yellow, let it mellow”—you can make a difference by making small adjustments that add up to big change. Here are 11 ideas to get you started for Earth Day. It may seem counterintuitive, but your dishwasher is way more energy- and water-efficient at washing dishes than you are, as long as you’re running a full dishwasher.Accordingto one German study, dishwashers use half of the energy and a sixth of thewater, not to mention less soap. So, don’t feel guilty about skipping the sink of sudsy water, or aboutnot pre-rinsingbefore loading up the machine—you’re actually doing theenvironmenta favor by firing up your dishwasher. Not only is it convenient to pay all of your bills with a click or two, it’s also an easy way to go greener. One study found that the average U.S. household receives 19 bills and statements from credit card companies, banks, and utilities every month. By switching to online statements and online bill pay, each American householdcould saveat least several pounds of paper and avoid producing over 170 pounds of greenhouse gases. Not bad for simply clicking a few “receive online statements” boxes.

The non-profit organizations recommends that you sign up for theUSPS Do Not Mailservice at the same time so you can hit multiple junk-mailers efficiently. Planting trees is obviously great for the environment, but if you’re strategic about it, it can help you reduce your energy costs and use less fossil fuel. According to ArborDay.org, planting large deciduous trees on the east, west, and northwest sides of your house can shade and cool your home during the warmer months, even slashing your air conditioning costsby up to 35 percent. To maximize your impact, choosetree species that are nativeto your part of the country—you’ll be cooling your home as well as providing food and habitat for pollinators, birds, and other wildlife. Leaving the tap running while youtend to your pearly whiteseach morning and night uses abouteight gallons of water a day. Just turn the tap on when you need to wet your brush or rinse, instead of letting H20 pour uselessly down the drain. The same goes for anyone who shaves with the water running. Hitting up somethrift shopsis a green idea—and that goes for whether you’re getting rid of clutter or addinghousehold essentialsto your home. Buying and donating to thrift stores and second-hand shops means you’re recycling, supporting your local economy, and saving money. And grab a little guy for your desk at work, too.House plants and desk plantshave beenprovento improve your mood and raise productivity, but they also purify the air by removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in homes and offices. They also absorb carbon dioxide and increase the humidity. Low-maintenance plantsincludepothos, spider plants, jade, varioussucculents, and peace lilies. Cut up paper that has only been used on one side and use it to scribble reminders, notes, grocery lists, and more. Or flip it over for any kids you know to color on. (You can color on it, too, if you want.) Yourcoffeelikely traveled thousands of miles to arrive in your pantry, so get good use out of it. Use your grounds tomulch plantsthat love acidic soil, like roses, evergreens, and rhododendrons. If your garden problems tend to be less about the dirt and more about the things that liveinit, certain garden pests hatecoffee—namely ants, slugs, and snails. Sprinkle grounds in problem areas to deter them. Compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs—the spiral light bulbs) may cost more upfront, but they’ll save up to $57 over the life of the bulb. More importantly, they use70 percent less energythan traditional bulbs and installing them is as easy as screwing in a light bulb. (Sorry.) You don’t have to cut out your daily driving entirely, but when you only have a few blocks, or perhaps just a mile or two to travel and don’t need to transport anything bulky, consider walking, rollerblading, or hopping on your bike.

29,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501978/8-things-you-need-know-about-earth,,"It’s probably best if we don’t think too much about Earth. After all, it’s a tiny orb spinning more than 1000 mph at the equator while simultaneously zipping throughspaceat 67,000 mph. It circles a mysterious, 10,000°Fsunthat’s more than 100 times its size, and spends most of its orbit narrowly (in a cosmic sense) avoiding collisions with giant chunks of rock that could practically wipe its surface clean. But if you’re feeling brave, here are a few things you might not know about Earth. In 2017, Mental Floss spoke toJosh Willis, a climate scientist atNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, about the planet we call home. As you probably know, at this distance, it takes one year for Earth to complete one revolution of its orbit, and 24 hours to complete one rotation on its axis. The surface of Earth has temperatures ranging from -126°F to 136°F. The planet is about 7900 miles in diameter (though thedeepest we've ever drilledis 7.6 miles). There are roughly332.5 cubic miles of wateron the planet, which is enough that, if the water broke away from Earth and organized itself into a sphere, it would have a diameter of860 miles—about 40 percent that of themoon. It’s a grainy, black-and-white shot of a tiny slice of our world, curved with the ink of space as a backdrop. In 1960, weather satellites began sending photographs back to Earth, images that were still hideously deformed but scientifically valuable, especially for meteorologists, who now hadstunning views of cloud systemsfrom which to work. NASA’s ATS-III satellite in 1967 returned the first color images of Earth in its entirety. At last, we could see our living world, ringed in space and wrapped in billowing clouds. On Christmas Eve, 1968, Apollo 8 astronaut William Anders sent backEarthrise, a now-iconic photograph of a fragile cerulean orb rising over the lunar surface. But the most famous photograph of the Earth, by far, was taken about four years later, on December 7, 1972: theBlue Marble. You’ve probably seen it countless times, but you may be less familiar with how astronaut Harrison Schmitt described the sight to Mission Control: “I’ll tell you, if there ever was a fragile-appearing piece of blue in space, it’s the Earth right now.” Earth is the first planet, moving outward from the sun, that possesses a moon. We call our moon “the moon” (which will be a real headache centuries from now, when we’ve colonized the solar system). Every 27.32 days, the moon completes an orbit of Earth, which is why it has phases. When Earth is between the sun and the moon, we see the moon in full illumination (a round orb). As it circles Earth, less and less of its visible surface is illuminated, until at last the moon is between the sun and Earth. At that point, the “far side” of the moon is in full illumination, and from our perspective, the moon is receiving no light at all. The cycle then repeats itself, with more of its disc being illuminated as the month elapses, until it is again full. Because the length of the moon’s orbit is just shy of a month, every so often a month (which derives from the wordmoon) has two full moons, the second of which is called a blue moon. The moon does spin, but in synchronous rotation with Earth. In other words, it spins at the same speed as its orbit. As a result, Earth gets to see only one side of our only natural satellite. The best guess forthe origin of the mooninvolves an object the size of Mars smashing into Earth 4.5 billion years ago, sending debris into space. This debris organized itself into a molten form of the alabaster orb we know and love. Within 100 million years, an early crust had begun to form. Today, the moon influences the tides of the ocean and eases our axial wobble, keeping things (more or less) nice and stable—a perfect condition for life. When it comes to life, there are a lot of maybes in the solar system. MaybeMarssupported life billions of years ago. MaybeJupiter's moon Europais teeming with life today. The problem is that there is noevidenceanywhere of anything that wiggles, walks, or swims … except on Earth. And it has been tough going. Four billion years ago, Earth’s surface was sterilized during theLate Heavy Bombardment, when asteroids pummeled the inner solar system. To get some idea of what things must have been like during the LHB, look at the moon. Most of its craters were formed during that time. Life survived on Earth in large part thanks to thehydrothermal ventsat the bottom of the ocean. There have been five mass extinctions on Earth, the worst of which (thePermian-Triassic, or “P-T Event”) was 250 million years ago, wiping out 96 percent of marine species and nearly three-quarters of land vertebrates. Sixty-six million years ago, theChicxulub impactwiped out75 percent of all lifeand ended the reign of the dinosaurs. Things recovered nicely, though, and today, biologists think there could be8.7 million speciesof life on Earth. That’s not bad considering the universe’s apparent hostility to life, and makes what we have going here all the more special and worth preserving. And we’d better get on it: Many scientists argue that we’re in the midst of asixth mass extinction—and we can only partiallyblame it on cats. “Global warming is real, it’s caused by people, and it’s a big problem,” Willis told Mental Floss in 2017. “Every year the impacts of human-caused climate change get bigger and bigger, and are felt more and more across the planet.” We feel the effects of climate change today, but the worst is yet to come in terms of economic and social disruption: “Right now we have a choice about what kind of planet we want to have in the future. And the choice is: Do we want to continue to burn fossil fuels and heat up Earth, or do we want to try and stabilize our climate and keep it more or less like we’ve had it for the last 10,000 years?” Icy moons likeEuropaandEnceladushave subsurface oceans of liquid water, and Titan, in addition to a possible subsurface water ocean, has vast lakes of liquid methane covering its surface—but no other celestial object has oceans ofH2Olike ours. Unfortunately, they're rising. NASA'sJason-3spacecraft measures the height of the ocean with 1-inch accuracy. Every 10 days, it collects data on the entire ocean, revealing details about such things as ocean currents and how they change, tilts in the ocean's surface, and the average volume of the ocean. “The oceans are growing for two reasons,” Willis said. “One is because they absorb heat trapped by the greenhouse gases, and the other is that the ice in places like Greenland andAntarcticaand tiny glaciers all across the planet are all melting and adding extra water to the oceans. This satellite measures these things combined, and in a way it’s really taking the pulse of our planet.” A decade ago, the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica were thought of as stable. They are the last remaining ice sheets that cover huge land masses, andtoday they are disappearing. In 50 years, their melting will be the dominant source of global sea level rise. ""Every time a big discovery is made,"" says Willis, ""it seems like the picture is worse than we thought it was. The possibility for really rapid ice loss and rapid sea level rise is greater than we thought."" The oceans remain agiant unknownfor scientists. Knowing more about them would answer many of our questions about life and the life of Earth. “Two-thirds of the planet is covered with water, and you can’t see through it. And you can’t shoot microwaves through it, and radio waves, and all the other kinds of things that we use even to measure other planets,” Willis said. “If you probe the ocean, there are still a lot of big mysteries down there.” To understand how oceans really work would explain, for example, where the heat from global warming is going. Though the oceans absorb 95 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, it’s still a mystery where that heat energy actually goes. Similar questions exist as to how the oceans interact with ice sheets. But it will take a concerted effort to change our behavior—before it’s too late. “We think ofglobal warmingas something that happens in our cities, and itishappening there, but really 95 percent of the heat that’s being trapped is going in the oceans. And I don’t think people realize that. It just seems like, well, we’re getting the brunt of global warming here in Los Angeles—but that’s not true, really. It’s the sea life and the oceans that are getting the brunt of the change,” Willis said. “One thing we should keep in mind is that all hope is not lost,” he continued. “We are beginning to see changes in our economy, we’re beginning to see the growth of renewable energy, and the strong desire to move to a fuel source that doesn't cook us, and I think that’s a good thing.” A version of this story was published in 2017; it has been updated for 2023."
30,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/623426/why-april-22-was-chosen-for-earth-day,,"Each year,Earth Dayis a time to turn our attention toward theenvironmentand raise awareness about threats to its well-being, from air pollution toclimate change. But why does Earth Day fall on April 22? Is there anysignificanceto the date? When the inaugural Earth Day wassuggestedby Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson and San Francisco activist John McConnell in 1970, a date was needed that would allow for activists attending college to be free to participate, a point made by organizerDenis Hayes. April 22 fell between spring break and final exams for most universities. While that was a matter of logistics, April 22 also has a deeper meaning. Earth Day was inspired in part byArbor Day, a tree-planting event that was organized by Nebraska newspaper publisher Julius Sterling Morton in 1872. Arbor Day was set for April 10. Later, when Arbor Day was declared a legal holiday by Nebraska, the state honored Morton bychanging the dateto his birthday—April 22. McConnell actually preferred theSpring Equinoxfor Earth Day, since marking the changing of the seasons and a balanced amount of daylight and darkness represented Earth’s unique traits. Because April 22 allowed college students to be more active in the events, however, that was the date that stuck. The modern Earth Day, with its themed objectives and upbeat spirit, is a marked departure from the first Earth Day in 1970, which had demonstrations that bordered on protests. (One enthusiastic group smashed an old Chevrolet to condemn air pollution.) While the world recognizes Earth Day, outside the U.S. it’s actuallyknown by another name: International Mother Earth Day. A version of this story ran in 2020; it has been updated for 2023."
31,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/586059/chernobyl-animal-facts,,"Almost four decadesafter the Chernobyl disaster—the world’s worst nuclear accident—signs of life are returning to the exclusion zone. Wild animals in Chernobylare flourishingwithin the contaminated region;puppiesroaming the area are capturing the hearts of thousands.Touristswho have watched the critically acclaimed HBO seriesChernobylaretaking selfieswith the ruins. Once thought to be forever uninhabitable, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a haven for flora and fauna that prove that life, as they say inJurassic Park, finds a way. A faulty design and improperly trained workers are two of the precipitating factors that led to an explosion in Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986. The disaster devastated the environment: The total amount of radioactive material eventually released was hundreds of times higher than seen in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods: theRed Forest. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered toshoot any stray animalswithin the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another20,000 years, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived. AsWIREDpoints out, the Chernobyl disaster presents an unintended experiment in what Earth would be like without humans. Hunting is strictly illegal and living within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone isnot recommended. The fewer humans there are, the more nature can re-establish itself unencumbered by human activity.According toThe Guardian, an official nature reserve recently created on the Belorussian side of the zone claims to be “Europe’s largest experiment in rewilding,” where animals are losing their fear of humans. In fact, a few species are actually living better within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone than outside of it. According tobiologist Jim Beasley, the population of large mammals in the exclusion zone has surpassed the numbers found before the near-meltdown. Bears, wolves,lynx,bison, deer,moose, beavers, foxes,badgers,wild boar, andraccoon dogsare just some of the species that have seemed to find a happy home in the radioactive area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria make the unpopulated environment their home. A constant dose of low-level radiation obviously isn’t beneficial, but it may be the case—for some animals, at least—that it isn’t deleterious enough to outweigh the pre-disaster impact of human beings encroaching on habitats and actively hunting wildlife. Wolves, in particular, may benefit from their propensity to travel great distances, giving them the opportunity to dilute the amount of radiation consumed during hunting. Beasley pegged the population density of the Chernobyl wolves as significantly higher than that found in America’s Yellowstone National Park. The biologist toldNational Geographicthat “humans have been removed from the system and this greatly overshadows any of those potential radiation effects.” The Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institutecalled Przewalski’s horses“the last truly wild horse.” Other species sometimes referred to as wild, like the kind you might find on the United States’ Assateague Island National Seashore, are properly classified as feral domestic horses—they descend from horses that escaped domestication. Whether Przewalski horses—also called Takhi—can truly be called a wild species or subspecies is actually a matter of some debate. But what’s clear is that a once-large population that ranged across large swaths of Asia and Europe was eventually reduced to almost nothing. When Lee Boyd and Katherine A. Houpt edited a book about the animal in 1994, the most recent wild sighting had occurred in the late ‘60s, leading the authors todeclare them“extinct in the wild.” But British ecologists Mike Wood and Nick Beresford, who specialize in studying the effects of radiation on Chernobyl’s wildlife,observedthat the Przewalski’s horse is thriving within the CEZ. In the late 1990s, about 30 Przewalski’s horses were released in the Ukrainian side of the CEZ, and that population has increased to more than 200. Based on camera trap images, Wood estimated that some of the original horses (identified by their brand markings) are still alive. Photos of juvenile horses and foals also indicated that the population is expanding. In contrast to large carnivores and other big fauna, insects and spiders have seen a big drop in their numbers. A2009 studyinBiology Lettersindicated that the more radiation there was in certain locations around the Chernobyl disaster area, the lower the population of invertebrates. A similar phenomenon occurred after the 2011 nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Bird, cicada, and butterfly populations decreased, while other animal populations were not affected. Scientists have noted significant genetic changes in organisms affected by the disaster: According toa 2011 studyinBiological Conservation, Chernobyl-caused genetic mutations in plants and animals increased by a factor of 20. Among breeding birds in the region, rare species suffered disproportional effects from the explosion’s radiation compared to common species. Further research is needed to understand how the increased mutations affect species’ reproductive rates, population size, genetic diversity, and othersurvival factors. In 2018,scientist Michael Byrnetracked a wolf traveling a great distance—ultimately outside of the Exclusion Zone—and wondered whether the disproportionately high number of mutations in the Chernobyl animals could be passed on to other populations. Byrne struck an even-handed chord regarding his speculation: “I don’t want to say that animals from Chernobyl are contaminating the world. But if there are any forms of mutations that could be passed on, it’s a thing to consider.” That doesn’t mean there’s a bunch of three-eyed fish or two-headed cows in the Exclusion Zone, though. In 2016, footage of some very large catfish in the cooling pond of the Chernobyl reactor spread online, leading some to conclude that the radiation had supercharged the fishes’ growth. It’s doubtful that the mutations caused by radiation, though, would lead to a larger overall size. These types of mutations generally decrease an animal’s fitness and ability to grow to full size, let alone some kind of Hulk-like supersize. The explanation for the large catfish was actually quite simple: some fish are just really big. There have been some oddities recorded within the area, and tour guides tell visitorsnot to petChernobyl animals due to potential radioactive particles in their fur, but today’s wild animals are sporting their normal number of limbs and aren’t glowing. It seems that the most dramatic genetic mutations occurred immediately after the explosion at Reactor Four, consistent with what we’ve observed in human beings. About 30 people died within months of the original explosion, primarily from acute radiation syndrome. Longer-term deaths related to the disaster are a matter of considerable debate, though there is evidence that thyroid cancer rates were elevated in people (especially children) exposed to Chernobyl’s radiation—possibly through contaminated food. Perhaps surprisingly, a study published in the journalScienceshowed that parents who experienced genetic mutations as a result of radiation exposure did not pass those mutations onto their children. It makes some sense that the biggest impacts would be felt in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, given how radiation works. Over the years, some of the potentially harmful radionuclides released by the blast have decayed, presumably making the area less dangerous to live in. Uncontrolled iodine-131exposure, for example, is known to increase the risk of thyroid disease, including cancer. But it has a halflife of onlyeight days, and would havebasically disappearedfrom the zone within a few months. Other radioactive isotopes are still present in significant quantities. Cesium-137, for example, has a half life ofover 30 years. And some animals are disproportionately affected: One risk factor is the animal’s diet. Voles, for example, are a type of adorable little rodent that likes to eat a lot of mushrooms. Unfortunately, some mushroom species happen to be particularly good at concentrating radiation, passing on the harmful material to hungry voles. And they seem to demonstrate the harmful effects of radiation in a number of ways: The critters were shown to be less fertile in areas withhigher concentrations of radiation, with a corresponding drop in overall populations. They were also shown to have higher rates of cataracts than animals from outside the Exclusion Zone. Barn swallows in the area were shown to demonstrate elevated levels ofpartial albinism, presumably a result of radiation-related genetic mutations. Areas with higher levels of radiation also seemingly gave rise to bird populations withsmaller brains,less viable sperm, and decreased species diversity and abundance. So the story of Chernobyl’s animals isn’t a simple one of the land returning to some kind of fecund paradise, but it also isn’t the barren wasteland you might have imagined. Hundreds of pooches—thedescendants of dogsabandoned by their owners during the site’s evacuation on April 27, 1986—have made the desolate area their home. Now, an organization called theClean Future Fundhelps conduct sterilization campaigns in the area. They also provide medical care, vaccinations, and even food to the Chernobyl pups (and cats). Back in 2018 and 2019, a number of dogs were identified as having safe levels of radiation, and a few dozen were actually adopted. As of mid-2022, it seemed that the combination of the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have disrupted the organization’s efforts, though they do continue to do occasional work in the Exclusion Zone. Some of the Chernobyl dogs have beenadopted by peoplewho live in the Exclusion Zone. Despite laws ostensibly prohibiting it, there are actually a number of human beings living in the Exclusion Zone, some with tacit permission from authorities. These residents are called Samosely, orself settlers. They’re mostly seniors, mostly women, and mostly lived in the area before the nuclear disaster. For any number of reasons, the Samosely have decided that the potential risks of radiation are outweighed by other considerations—financial, cultural, and geopolitical—that called them to the area.

32,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/75879/10-bumpy-facts-about-cane-toads,,"What is likely the world’s largest cane toad—dubbed Toadzilla—weighed just shy of six pounds when it was found in Conway National Park in Queensland, Australia, in January 2023. “I reached down and grabbed the cane toad and couldn‘t believe how big and heavy it was,” ranger Kylee Graysaidin a statement. The Queensland government believed the ample amphibian “could set a new record.” Cane toads (Rhinella marina), native to Central and South America, are a prolific invasive species in Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, and Florida. Like environmental wrecking balls, the toxic toads threaten native fauna. Here are the essential facts. “The Choco Indians of western Colombia used to ‘milk’ toads by placing them in bamboo tubes over an open fire,” Christopher Lever writes inThe Cane Toad: The History and Ecology of a Successful Colonist. Concentrated poison trickled into a bottle, and the dangerous substance was smeared over arrowheads and blowgun darts. Theaveragewild cane toad usually reaches a length of 4 to 6 inches and weighs about three pounds.  Some specimens have grown much larger, though. Before Toadzilla, the biggest one on record weighed more than five pounds. The toads aresexually dimorphic; females are usually larger. Males also have rougher skin and make an assortment of vocalizations. In 1900, Australia’s sugar cane growers asked the government for solutions to the frequent beetle and insect infestations that killed their crops. The Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES) tried various pesticides, but none worked. Then, in 1935, staff entomologistReginald Mungomerywas sent to Hawaii with instructions to round up some cane toads, which had been introduced there to save the islands‘ sugar crops from the same insect problems. The BSES set up a captive breeding program with the imported toads, and later that year, unleashed102 cane toadsin northern Queensland. Their population skyrocketed, and totals about1.5 billiontoads today. A few days after a female cane toad lays her eggs, theyhatchinto tadpoles, a chapter in the life cycle that lasts for four to eight weeks. The tadpoles are prone to cannibalism, and have been known to eat the eggs and tadpoles of other cane toads (they don‘t eat their own siblings, though). While the young can make short work of each other, anything else that tries to eat them is in for a bad experience: Both cane toad eggs and tadpoles arepoisonous. When threatened, cane toads secrete a dangerous cocktail of chemicals, including 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine. People who ingest this compound, usually by licking the toads,experience strong hallucinationsand a full-body rush. Unfortunately, their symptoms may also include severely weakened muscles, intense vomiting, seizures, and death byheart stoppage. Keep your tongue away from the toads! These toads aren’t picky eaters, and they are happy to devour anything that canfit into their mouths, including beetles, bees, ants, crickets, frogs, snakes, aquatic snails, and even small dogs and cats. In residential areas, cane toads are often seen climbing into dog food bowls and chowing down on the contents. Cane toads’ hides can be turned into a bumpy, poison-freeleather. As a wedding gift tothe then-Prince Charleson hismarriage to Diana Spencerin 1981, the Australian Defense Department offered the royal couple a handsome book bound in the skins of four cane toads. For reasons previously stated, you’ll want to keep live cane toads as far away from your mouth as possible. But—if they’re properly prepared—cane toads are actually edible. In recent years, Australian  chefs have incorporated cane toad legs into their entrées. These juicy treats may be sautéed, stir fried, or thrown into a nicesalad. “It’s healthy foodstuff,” Philip Hayward, an island studies professor at Southern Cross University, toldABC. “We can severely reduce numbers … and at the same time have a healthy, economically viable product.” “Buffy,” as residents call her, commemorates the town’s sugar cane farmers. It began life in 1983 as apapier-mâchéornament on a float in that year’s Apex Sugar Festival. The model was then cast in fiberglass and moved to Broad Street in central Sarina. Researchers at the University of Queensland have been assessing the medical benefits of this notorious toxin since 2010. Experiments have shown that cane toad poison selectively kills cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact. “We could process the [toxin] for medicine, ideally in a tablet because it tastes absolutely awful,” Dr. Harenda Parekh, a senior lecturer at the school of pharmacy,toldThe Guardianin 2016. The product would be similar tochan su, a traditional Chinese medicine made with poison from an indigenous Asian toad, to treat skin conditions, heart failure, and sore throats. Poison from Australian cane toads may offer an alternative source and save the native amphibian. “The cane toad is a pest here to stay and we are fighting a losing battle against it,” Parekh said, “but we could turn them into a lucrative export.”"
33,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501587/what-kind-fish-dory,,"Finding Nemo(2003) and its 2016 sequel,Finding Dory, led to millions ofPixarviewers becoming infatuated with the friendly,forgetfulDory (voicedby Ellen DeGeneres). Dory’s real-life counterpart is aParacanthurus hepatus, orPacific blue tang fish, which is sometimes referred to as aroyal blue tangorhippo tang. The name is slightly misleading, since the blue tang isn’t always blue. At night, without light to reflect off its pigmentation, it can appear white with violet touches. When it’s young, it’s mostly yellow. Here’s a little more about what ‘Dory fish’ are like in real life—and whether one belongs in your fish tank. AsNational Geographicreports, blue tangs live nearcoral reefs, where there’s plenty of algae—their main food source—for them to scrape off. It’s good for the coralreefs, too, since algae build-up has been linked to adecrease in reef healthand could upset the food chain. If you’re hoping to spot a blue tang in the wild, you should head to a coral reef in either the Pacific or Indian Ocean. According to theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature, the fish are known to reside near Australia, India, Thailand, Japan, Guam, American Samoa, Kenya, South Africa, and a whole host of other territories. WhenDisneyreleased its live-action adaptation of101 Dalmatiansin 1996, the charm of thedogsonscreen had a significant impact on sales of the breed. So much so, in fact, that animal activistsvoiced their concernthat people were buyingDalmatianswithout understanding their unique temperament, leading to scores of Dalmatians ending up in shelters. InFinding Dory’s case, a2019 studyfailed to find evidence that the actual purchase of blue tangs increased after the movie's release. But the discourse was full of questions about the ethics of owning one. Like many tropicalfish, blue tangs have never been successfully bred in commercialaquariums(thoughresearchers at the University of Floridamay have figured out a way to change that). Instead, fishermen capture themwith cyanide—either squirting some at the fish directly or pumping it into the water—hoping the poison will lead some of them to the surface for easier scooping. Obviously, addingpoisoninto a marine environment isn’t whatconservationistswould consider a smart move. It can pollute waters, damage reefs, and kill fish, even some time after the fact (organ failure is not uncommon among fish exposed to cyanide). Some estimate that half of the living things that come into contact with that cyanide willdie immediately. As you may have already guessed, wondering what kind of fish Dory is is a little bit more of a loaded question than just finding out her species. A “real” Dory might be laced with cyanide, be aggressive toward other fish (particularly other blue tangs), and can grow to be almost a foot in length—a far cry from the diminutive, lovable character in the feature films. Demand for the fish could also lead to population problems. For all of those reasons, if anyone in your household is wondering what kind of fish Dory is with an eye on obtaining one, the answer is simple: She’s the kind you should really be leaving alone. If you’re just wondering about thePixarfranchise’sfish speciesout of pure curiosity, however, here are some additional details you might appreciate. Gill is aMoorish idol(Zanclus cornutus), another coral reef dweller. Bubbles is a yellow tang (Zebrasoma flavescens), from the same family (Acanthuridae) as Dory.Debis thought to be either a four-stripe damselfish (Dascyllus melanurus) or a three-stripe damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus), though they’re usuallyblack and whiterather than blue and white. Nemo and his dad, Marlin, are, of course, clownfish—which havemore talentsthan the movies cover. Have you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

34,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/649682/biggest-volcanic-eruptions-all-time,,"For hard evidence of nature’s ability to erupt into catastrophic disaster, look no further than thevolcano. These metaphorical portals to hell, which currentlynumberabout 1500 globally, not only spew volcanic ash and lava, but can radically alter theclimateand the course of world events. Most are stratovolcanoes—cone-shaped elevations built over time from layers of ash and lava. Their relativelysoft compositionallows pressure to build up inside until they blow, resulting in explosive eruptions with little prior warning. Their steep slopes also generate mudslides andpyroclastic flows. All of these factors make them the most dangerous volcano type. (In contrast, shield volcanoes—like those in Hawaii—are low to the ground and often emit syrupy lava from vents in the Earth.) Need examples? Look no further than these incendiary volcanic milestones, in no particular order. Volcanic eruptions can be measured in terms of consequences or simply in terms of sheer output. In the case of the latter, the Novarupta, or Katmai, eruption that began June 6, 1912, was a monumental event. Over 13 cubic kilometers of lava wasreleasedover the course of 60 hours, or the equivalent of 573.2 million tons every hour. In Kodiak, about 100 miles away, over1 footof ash collected on the ground. The cooled sheet of ash surrounding the volcano wound up forming the “Valley of 10,000 Smokes,” creating steaming fumaroles (openings in the ground where gas or water vapor escapes). The incident evenpromptedan atmospheric haze that was said to have reduced summer temperatures. All told, it was the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century andearned a 6on theVolcanic Explosivity Index(VEI), a measurement of the explosive thrust of an eruption, with 1 being least powerful and 8 being the most powerful. Indonesia holds the unwelcome distinction of hosting two of the most potent volcanic events of the 1800s. (Unfortunate, but understandable—its 150 active volcanoes are the most of any country.) Oneoccurredin August 1883, when Krakatoa (sometimes spelled Krakatau) erupted on an island near Sumatra. Roughly five cubic miles of lava shot 50 miles into the air and ushered in massive tsunamis. The volcano gave off several warnings in the months leading up to its big burst, with a series of comparatively smaller explosions where the ash plume reachedonlyseven miles into the sky. The first big blast, with a VEI of 6, came August 26, which demolished two-thirds of the island. Multiple eruptions followed, resulting in a global veil of ash that ultimately caused the planet’s temperature to drop by several degrees. About 36,000 people were killed, including 31,000 who perished when the tsunamis crashed into neighboring islands. The mercilessness of volcanoes was on full and morbid display with Mount Tambora, whichblewin April 1815 in Sumbawa, Indonesia. In the days before the blast, which had a VEI of 7, nearby soldiers heard cannon-like rumbling and armed themselves, thinking an enemy was about to attack. In a way, one was. Tambora spewed 12 cubic miles of gases and dust 25 miles into the atmosphere, triggering towering tsunamis and drenching the surrounding islands in ash. Roughly 10,000 people perished immediately, and a total of 90,000 died due to resulting food shortages. Today, scientists believe the epic eruption may have radically altered global weather, leading to crop failures and famine in North America and Europe. In 1816, with Tambora’s ash still blanketing the skies of the Northern Hemisphere, the poet Lord Byron challenged his literary friends, includingMary Shelley, to write something appropriately macabre. She beganFrankenstein. Volcanic terror hit North America on May 18, 1980, when Mount St. Helensblew its top. Days earlier, an earthquake had prompted avalanches on the volcano. Thousands of earthquakes followed, which destabilized the terrain. Then, a 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit, causing the peak to blow ash and hot gases skyward. The blast took an incredible 1314 feet off the height of the mountain. Effects were felt and seen across 230 square miles, and 158 miles of highway were damaged. Recovery from the disaster cost over $1.1 billion. With 57 people killed,Mount St. Helens's explosion—with aVEI of 5—remains the deadliest volcanic eruption in U.S. history. While not quite on the level of other massive eruptions (it’s only a 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index), the lore surrounding the rage of Mount Vesuvius puts it in a category all its own. The volcano exploded on August 24 in the year 79 CE,turningthe Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum into frozen portraits of thousands of interrupted lives. Before being blanketed in ash, Pompeii was known for fertile ground that fed orchards and vineyards; Herculaneum was a summer getaway for the Roman elite. When Vesuvius erupted, many stayed behind hoping to wait it out. But another blast gassed and incinerated the cities, then buried them in mud and ash. The cities were rediscovered in the 18th century, and newdiscoveriesabout the last days of Pompeii and Herculaneum are still being made. A colossal volcanic eruption—6 on the VEI—of recent vintage, Mount Pinatubocausedcataclysmic destruction of a thickly populated part of Luzon in the Philippines on June 15, 1991. After a series of earthquakes and a stream of magma making its way 20 miles upwards to the surface of the Earth, Pinatubo’s activity crescendoed when gas-powered lava, totaling more than five cubic kilometers, was released. Pyroclastic flows of ash and pumice left deposits over 660 feet thick at the foot of the mountain, while tropical storms created vast mudslides out of the volcanic ejecta. Heavy layers of wet ash crushed buildings. Fortunately, scientific forecasts were able to warn residents, who were evacuated; thousands of lives weresaved. For sheer stubbornness, few volcanic eruptions beat Laski, located in what isnowVatnajökull National Park in Iceland. Instead of one giant eruption, Laki perpetuated aseriesof lava flows and explosions that lasted for more than eight months in 1783 and 1784 and registered a VEI of 4. Laki produced enough lava to pave the entire city of Boston 207 feet deep. The eruption emitted gases that resulted in acid rain strong enough to burn leaves and irritate skin, while the toll on livestockcauseda famine that may have killed up to one-quarter of Iceland’s population at the time. Like the aftermath of Tambora's eruption, Laki's ash veil caused widespread weather disruption and food shortages in Europe. It may have even fueled the unrest that preceded the French Revolution. Mount Pelée loomed over the quiet hamlet of St. Pierre, on the French Caribbean island of Martinique, like a ticking time bomb. In early May 1902, a violentlahar—a river of volcanic rock fragments and water—burst out of the side of the mountain, inundating a sugar refinery before reaching the sea and triggering a tsunami. The disturbances caused wildlife like huge insects and venomous snakes to flee the mountains and seek safety in the town. Bites from vipers killed about 50 people. But the island’s governor assured residents that there was no real danger. Unfortunately, he was extremely wrong. On May 8, the mountain exploded with a VEI of 4, unleashing a blast of superheated gas and debris that destroyed St. Pierre and killed 30,000 residents in just a few minutes. At 77 square miles, Nevado del Ruiz is animposingstratovolcano. It has erupted several times since 1570, but the most memorable event occurred November 13, 1985. As magma bubbled up toward the volcano’s apex, the heat melted huge glaciers that blanketed the peak. The rivers of melted ice became devastating lahars, which joined up with existing rivers to cause catastrophic mudslides in the valleys. During the VEI 3 eruption, the nearby town of Armero wasflattenedand 23,000 people lost their lives in the floods. The people inhabiting North Island in New Zealand got a seismic shock on June 10, 1886, when Mount Tarawera erupted,formingfissures in the Earth that extended 10 miles from the epicenter. TheVEI 5blasts were heard up to 310 miles away, making it the largest volcanic event in New Zealand’s history. It also has some ghost stories attached to it. Some European residents insisted they saw a Māori war canoe sailing on Lake Tarawera just before the eruption. They hailed the sailors, but they didn't respond. Later, after the cataclysm, the observers learned no such canoe had ever been seen on the lake. Beneath the grounds of Yellowstone National Park lurks a supervolcano, one that’sbelievedto have erupted substantially at least three times in recorded human history: 2.1 million years ago (which had a VEI of 8), 1.3 million years ago, and 664,000 years ago. The last left a depression in the ground 34 miles by 50 miles in size. Today, the magma underneath Yellowstone is five miles deep, prompting some to speculate that if it ever erupted—and there’s a non-zero chance of that happening—it could bury the Rockies in ash, thanks to its potential for unleashing asuper-eruption(anything with a VEI of 8 or higher). A version of this story ran in 2021; it has been updated for 2023."
35,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/513564/7-eco-friendly-options-your-body-after-death,,"You drive an electric vehicle. You recycle.You’re a vegetarian. Do yourfinal wishesreflect your eco-friendly lifestyle? Though it’s not likely to be discussed at a funeral, the popular methods of body disposal—traditional burial or cremation—bothpose major environmental hazards. In recent years, natural interment has made a comeback, with promises to protect the planet. Here are eight eco-friendly ways to make your last act on Earth a kind one. Mushrooms are masters ofmyco-remediation—a process in whichfungibreak down toxic compounds in the environment. Loop, a Dutch company, is applying this idea to human burial with itsLiving Cocoon, a person-sized box made entirely of tough fungal fibers call mycelium. While the box is above ground and empty, the mycelium dries out and becomes solid; but when it’s buried with a permanent occupant, the moisture in the soil reactivates the fibers and the fungi begin to grow. Eventually, the body will be consumed, and the surrounding soil will be enriched. It’s an appealing thought for the green at heart, even though “eaten by mushrooms” may not be exactly how they pictured going out. With aquamation—also known as water cremation or alkaline hydrolysis—the body is placed in a stainless steel vesselfilledwith a solution of 95 percent water and 5 percent potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. A combination of rushing alkaline waters and temperatures around 350°F causes the body to dissolve in essentially the same process that happens to a body left outdoors or in a stream—but what would take months in nature takes about 20 hours in an aquamation pod. By the end, all that’s left is the skeleton, or parts thereof, which is ground up into a white powder with a pearly sheen. The remains are given to the loved ones, who may choose to scatter them like ashes or place them in a biodegradable urn. Advocates say the process emits about a fifth of the carbon dioxide of traditional cremation. Aquamation islegalin 25 states as of January 2023. In the early 1970s, anthropologistWilliam Basswanted to study how bodies decompose naturally. Using donated cadavers, he created a “farm” for forensic anthropologists to study a wide array of body decomposition scenarios. What does it look like if a body rots in a swamp? If it’s eaten by maggots? Crows? Welcome to the body farm, where disturbing dreams come true. Texas lays claim to thelargest body farmin the U.S., located on Freeman Ranch at Texas State University. The body farm is responsible for massive developments in criminal science and thanatology (the study of death); it’s aided in critical discoveries including the “microbial clock”—a process by which time of death can be identified by examining the posthumous microbiome. People can donate their bodies to a local body farm to further research (and save a good chunk of change on interment). There aresevencurrently operating in the United States, with more in other countries. In Tibet, Buddhists practice “sky burials” meant to encourage good karma. They take bodies of their loved ones to high-elevation charnel grounds wherevulturescome to eat the flesh, offering back to the world what was taken in life: meat. It’s believed that the practice encourages the dead to move along to the next life without being held back by one’s greatest attachment—their physical body. Ritual aside, these sky burials are apractical solutionin a region lacking in wood and usableburialgrounds (the rocky earth makes it hard to dig). Green burials look pretty much like normal burials, except for a few important differences. No embalming fluids or toxic chemicals of any kind are used. The grave is often dug by hand (either by the green burial ground staff or, if they choose, the loved ones themselves). There is no cement plot. Only biodegradable caskets, such as those made of wicker, can be used; sometimes the body is simply placed in an unbleached cloth shroud. This allows the corpse to decompose naturally, returning its nutrients to the earth. Many green burial grounds also serve as wildlife refuges, creating spaces foranimalsand native plant life—families can choose from a variety of live, wild grasses and flowers to adorn the grave. Aside from being environmentally friendly, this is a cheaper option than traditional burial considering the price tags on caskets and funerary services. The average cost of a viewing, embalming, and burial wasalmost $8000in 2021, while a green burial could cost half that amount or even less. Following in the tradition ofVikings, sailors, andpirates, those who loved the ocean in life can return in death with a sea burial. In addition to the countless water-soluble urns for cremains on the market, anentire bodycan be buried at sea in designated areas off the U.S. coast. Environmentally inclined businesses likeNew England Burials at Seaoffer more eco-friendly (and affordable) options such as natural burial shrouds hand-sewn by New England sail makers. A full day charter takes your funeral party out to sea and facilitates the service before dropping the body. Companies such asEternal Reefscan also mix cremated remains with environmentally friendly concrete to create artificial reefs that support marine life. Not everyone would want to sleep with the fishes, but many sailors consider it the most sacred of exits. As of December 31, 2022,six U.S. stateshave legalized human composting—Washingtonwas the first, followed by Colorado, Oregon, Vermont, California, and New York. In this process, a body is placed in a reusable tank and covered with organic materials like straw or wood chips. Microbes get to work breaking down the remains. About a month later, the deceased’s loved ones can collect the contents, now transformed into (roughly) a cubic yard of environmentally-friendly compost that can be added to gardens or flower beds. Peat marshes (orbogs) are highly acidic environments that preserve flesh andother materialsplaced in them. Hikers in Ireland and Scandinavia have stumbled upon mummified, tea-coloredbog bodiesdating back hundreds or thousands of years. So, while the alkaline waters of aquamation will dissolve a body post-haste, the acids in the bogs give a pH akin to that of vinegar. This acts like a pickling agent, freezing the body in time, and the tannins in the peat dye the bodies a leathery brown. Accidentally falling into a bog probably isn’t the next big trend in green burial, but itisa way to preserve human remains without harming the environment. A version of this story ran in 2018; it has been updated for 2023."
36,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/502504/9-facts-about-silent-spring-author-rachel-carson,,"Although she spent most of her career as a marine biologist, Rachel Carson (1907–1964) isrememberedmostly for raising the alarm over the dangers of pollution and pesticides. Her bookSilent Springdetailed how chemicals like DDT could have unintended consequences; both the work and the public’s reaction to it helped usher in the modernenvironmental movement. Take a look at a few facts about Carson’s inspiring life. Carson’s love of nature was no doubt due to early exposure. Her family lived on65 acresof farmland roughly 14 miles outside ofPittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She also loved writing: At age 10, Carson wrote a story about a downed fighter pilot, “A Battle in the Clouds,” and submitted it toSt. Nicholasmagazine, a publication geared to young writers that had also published pieces fromWilliam FaulknerandF. Scott Fitzgerald. Her story was accepted and published in 1918. Carson pursued formal education with zeal,winninga scholarship to the Pennsylvania College for Women. At the time she began attending, Carson had her sights set on earning an English degree and becoming a teacher and writer. She switched her major to biology—one of only three women at the school to join that department—and later earned herM.A. in zoologyfrom Johns Hopkins University in 1932. In 1935, Carson’s aptitude for communicating science earned her a job with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. She continued to write articles for both government and mainstream publications that presented elegant arguments on the need to preserve our natural world, including the oceans. Part of her duties involved writing seven-minute radio scripts for a segment called “Romance Under the Waters.” The following year, she was promoted to junior aquatic biologist, one of only two women of such stature at the bureau. In 1952, having become the editor-in-chief for all of the bureau’s publications, she left the agency to write full-time. While freelancing for publications likeThe Baltimore Sun, Carson feared that readers would dismiss her pro-environment message if they knew the writer was a woman. Science then was a male-oriented endeavor. To reduce that chance, she published pieces under thebyline“R.L. Carson.” Carson wasreveredas a science writer because she turned the sterile, dull copy common in environmental research into something of interest to a wider readership. InUnder the Sea-Wind, her 1941 book on marine life, Carson wrote about fish feeling fear and other animals wearing expressions. Some science writers scoffed, but those creative flourishes helped Carson deliver her work to a broader audience. Years beforeSilent Spring, Carson’s 1951 bookThe Sea Around Usput her on the literary map. The book, about the natural history of the oceans, wasserializedinThe New Yorkerand stayed onThe New York Timesbestseller list for 31 weeks, eventuallywinningthe National Book Award. The book’s success allowed Carson to move to the Maine coast to focus on writing. There, she met her neighbor, Dorothy Freeman, and found they shared a deep interest in the natural world. Over the next decade, Carson and Freeman developed a loving relationship, apparent in 750 letters edited andpublishedby Freeman’s granddaughter in 1995. In aletterfollowing a get-together in 1964, Carson wrote: From an early age, Carson had been cognizant of the environmental effects of toxic chemicals. Her farm was near a glue factory that slaughtered horses, and the smelloften compelledneighbors to abandon their porches and run indoors. Later, when Carson became a science writer, she felt the urge to warn people about studies indicating DDT could be harmful—but she knew that whoever did so would be making enemies of powerful people. Carson tried to get other writers, includingE.B. White, to tackle it. When no one offered, Carson took it on herself. In the years following her death, Carson was sometimes criticized for helping to foster hysteria about the use of pesticides like DDT. But shewasn’t the firstto question their impact on the environment. In 1957, five years before the publication ofSilent Spring, the U.S. Forest Service banned DDT from being sprayed around select aquatic areas. Nor was Carson advocating for a complete ban. What she wanted, she said, was to make sure people were informed about the potential hazards. When Carson was working onSilent Springin the early 1960s, she was suffering from a series of health problems that sapped her strength: viral pneumonia, ulcers, and breast cancer. Knowing she was being critical of the pesticides industry, she kept her health conditionslargely a secretin case her adversaries wanted to say she was blaming her problems on chemicals. True to her fears, pro-chemical businesses did lob personal attacks, calling her a communist and acat-owning spinster. WhenSilent Springwas published in 1962, PresidentJohn F. Kennedyfelt it was a crucial wake-up call for the environmental movement. To help offset any pushback from the chemical industry,Kennedy announcedthat the Department of Agriculture, among other government agencies, would be examining the role pesticides play in human illnesses. He then announced a special advisory board to study the questions Carson posed in the book. When the results of the board’s work were published in 1963, they supported Carson’s belief that the general public should be better informed about the potential hazards of such chemicals. DDT was eventually banned entirely in 1972. Carson passed away from complications following breast cancer treatment in 1964, before she could witness the changes in U.S. environmental policy thatSilent Springhelped to bring about. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter honored her posthumously with thePresidential Medal of Freedom, and the following year she appeared on a USPS stamp. Schools, research vessels, government buildings,wildlife refuges, and abridge in Pittsburghare now named for her. This article was originally published in 2017; it has been updated for 2022."
37,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/654207/extinct-foods-from-history,,"According to early 19th century writer U.P. Hendrick, the Ansault pearwas a fruit""of the highest quality."" We’ll have to take his word for it; the pear is believed to have disappeared shortly after those words were published. It’s one of the many fruits, vegetables, and meats that will never be tasted again. Whether they were eaten to extinction or succumbed to other factors, these are the foods from history you can no longer eat. Unlike other items on this list, theAnsault pearappeared relatively recently. First cultivated in Angers, France, in 1863, the fruit was prized for its delectable flesh. In the 1917 bookThe Pears of New York, Hendrick wrote, “the flesh is notable, and is described by the wordbuttery, so common in pear parlance, rather better than any other pear. The rich sweet flavor, and distinct but delicate perfume contribute to make the fruits of highest quality.” Irregular trees and the rise of commercial farming contributed to the fruit's demise. Ansault pear trees were impractical to grow in large orchards, and commercial farmers weren’t interested in wasting time on temperamental strains when other pear varieties were available to them. Nurseries stopped growing the pear and it disappeared in the early 20th century. Humans feasted on thepassenger pigeonfor centuries. It was such a vital food source for theSeneca peoplethat they named itjah’gowa, or “big bread.” Sadly, the North American bird was too tasty for its own good. Hunting, combined with habitat and food loss, reduced their numbers from up to 3 billion in the early 1800s to just one by 1900. Thatendling, a captive pigeon named Martha after America’s first First Lady, died at the Cincinatti Zoo in Ohio 1914. You may have heardaurochsmentioned inGame of Thrones, but this creature doesn’t belong in the same category as dragons. The real cattle species was domesticated 10,000 years ago in the early days of agriculture. They were big (“little below the elephant in size,” according to Julius Casear) and leaner than modern cows. After suffering from disease and habitat loss, the species dwindled until the last aurochs died in a Polish forest in the 17th century. Newbreeding effortsare aiming to revive the species—or at least produce a new animal that comes close. The beef from one aurochs-like cow bred in the modern era is reportedly juicy and tender with a “wild” taste. The ancient Greeks and Romans had many applications for thisleek-flavored herb. Its stalks were cooked and eaten like a vegetable, while its sap was dried and grated over various dishes as seasoning. It had medicinal uses as well; it was apparently an effective form of birth control, and its heart-shaped seeds may be why we associate the shape with love today.Silphiumonly grew on a 125-by-35-mile strip of land in modern Libya, and it couldn't be farmed; demand for the precious herb quickly outpaced its natural supply. Pliny the Elder wrote that only one silphium plant was discovered during his lifetime, and it was gifted to the Roman emperor Nero sometime between 54 CE and 68 CE. Dutch sailors first visited the island chain of Mauritius in 1598, and less than two centuries later the archipelago's nativedodowent extinct. Sailors relied on the birds as sustenance during long voyages at sea, but that isn't the primary reason they died out; habitat and the introduction of invasive species like rats and pigs ultimately wiped out the animal. Though humans did eat dodo meat, it was more for survival than taste. The last person to spot a dodo, an English sailor named Benjamin Harry, called its flesh ""very hard."" The Dutch word for dodo waswalghvodel, or “disgusting bird."" German naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller identified theSteller's sea cowaround the Commander Islands in the Bering Sea in 1741. Growing up to 30 feet long, it was significantly larger than the sea cows alive today. It was also pretty tasty. The salty meat was compared tocorned beef, and the fat apparently tasted likealmond oil. Sailors reportedly sipped the liquified blubber out of cups. Steller’s sea cows were a source of leather and lamp oil as well as meat, and the animal was hunted to extinction by 1768—less than 30 years after it was first described. Wooly mammoth meat was an important component of the diets of our earliest human ancestors. We ate so much of them that hunting may have contributed to their extinction around 2000 BCE (thoughclimate changewas likely a bigger factor). Despite being extinct for thousands of years, several modern scientists and explorers have claimed they’ve tasted mammoth flesh. Because mammoth specimens are often found perfectly preserved in the frigidArctic, they could technically be thawed and consumed. Unfortunately this doesn’t give us much insight into how the game tasted tens of thousands of years ago: Meat that’s been frozen for that long turns into rancid goo when defrosted. Bon appétit. Thomas Jefferson cultivatedTaliaferro applesat Monticello. In an1814 letterto his granddaughter, Jefferson said the small fruit produced ""unquestionably the finest cyder we have ever known, and more like wine than any liquor I have ever tasted which was not wine."" Though it’s believed that the apple was lost with the estate’s original orchard, some horticulturists still hold out hope for its survival—but with few written descriptions of the fruit available, we likely wouldn’t be able to identify Jefferson’s apple even if we did find it. Modern humans primarily killedgreat auksfor their down, leading to thespecies’s extinctionin the mid-19th century, but prior to that they were hunted for dinner. Fossil evidence indicates that Neanderthals were cooking the flightless birds over campfires as far back as 100,000 years ago. The Beothuk people of what is now Newfoundland, Canada, used great auk eggs to make pudding. Before the American bison was nearly hunted to extinction in the 19th century,Bison antiquus, or theancient bison, died out 10,000 years ago. Bones have been recovered showing evidence of butchering with tools. This suggests that Native Americans relied on the ancient bison for food as they did with its modern ancestors. Old Cornish cauliflowerwasn't famous for its taste, but it did have one advantage over other varieties. The vegetable was resistant to a destructive plant virus called ringspot. In the 1940s, European growers began replacing Old Cornish cauliflower with a French variety that shipped better, and it was extinct by the 1950s. As a result, ringspot has decimatedcauliflower cropsin certain regions of Britain."
38,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62220/what-do-they-use-dye-chicago-river-green-st-patricks-day,,"It wouldn’t be aSt. Patrick’s Daycelebration in the Windy City without 400,000 spectators crowding the banks of the Chicago River to “ooh” and “aah” at its (temporarily) emerald green tinge. But how do officials turn the water green? First, a bit of history: The dyeing tradition became an annualSt. Patrick's Day traditionin 1962, but its real origins go back even further. In the early days of his administration as Mayor of Chicago, Richard J. Daley was a man on a mission to develop the city’s riverfront area. There was just one problem: The river itself was asewage-filled eyesore. To get to the bottom of the city’s pollution problem and pinpoint the exact places where waste was being discarded into the waterway (and by whom), Daley authorized the pouring of a special green dye into the river that would allow them to see exactly where dumping was occurring. Fast-forward to late 1961 when Stephen Bailey—part of the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Local, the city’s St. Patrick’s Day Parade chairman, and a childhood friend of Daley’s—witnessed a colleague’s green-soaked coveralls following a day of pouring Daley’s dye into the Chicago River. That gave Baileyan idea: If they could streak the Chicago River green, why not turn itallgreen? Three months later, revelers got their first look at an Ecto Cooler-colored river when the city poured 100 pounds of the chemical into the water. They got a really good look, too, as the river remained green for an entire week. Over the next several years, the same practice was repeated, and again it was carried out by the Plumbers Local. The only difference was that the amount of dye used was cut in half over the next two years until they finally arrived at themagic number: 25 pounds of dye = one day of green water. Unfortunately, the dye that was intended to help spot pollution was an oil-based fluorescein that many environmentalists warnedwas actually damaging the river even more. After fierce lobbying, eco-minded heads prevailed, and in 1966 the parade organizers began usinga powdered, vegetable-based dye. While the exact formula for the orange powder (yes, it's orange until it's mixed with water) is kept top-secret—in 2003 one of the parade organizerstold a reporterthat revealing the formula would be akin to “telling where the leprechaun hides its gold”—there are plenty of details that the committee lets even non-leprechauns in on. The dyeing process begins onthe morning of the parade—which this year was Saturday, March 12, (it's always held on a Saturday) when six members of the local Plumbers Union hop aboard two boats, four of them on the larger vessel, the remaining two on a smaller boat. The larger boat heads out onto the water first, with three members of the crew using flour sifters to spread the dye into the river. The smaller boat follows closely behind in order to help disperse the substance. (Thebest placeto catch a glimpse is from the east side of Michigan Avenue, or on Upper and Lower Wacker Drive between Michigan Avenue and Columbus Drive.) Approximately 45 minutes later,voila, the Chicago River is green—but don’t expect it to stay that way. These days, the color only sticks around for aboutfive hours. Which is roughly the same amount of time it takes to get a perfectly pouredpint of Guinnessif you venture out to an Irish pub on St. Patrick’s Day.

39,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/94525/10-easy-grow-plants-first-time-gardeners,,"Growing a garden yields more than just delicious, nutritious treats. Cultivating your own plants, whether to eat them or simply admire their beauty, isgood for your overall wellbeing. The labor of tending to your plants boosts physical health, as it’s an excellent way to exercise, andspending time among natureis shown to reduce stress. If you’re looking to get your hands dirty—and start growing your own food—check out these 10 plants that don’t require an expert green thumb. These hardy flowers are tough to kill—in most areas of the United States, pansies are resilient enough to survive winter temperatures. More than300 varietiesof pansies exist, including several that have been specifically bred for really hot or really cold environments. The ideal time to plant pansies is when the soil temperature is around 50° to 60°F (August for the northern parts of the country to October in the southern), but you can also set yours out in the early spring. You can purchase fully grown plants at most gardening stores and deposit them directly into the ground. If you plan on growing some fromseeds, place each one in moist soil spaced 7 to 12 inches apart. In colder states, pansies do best in direct sunlight. If you live in a warm state like Georgia or Texas, give the flowers someshade—strategically plant them so they can spend three to four hours in the shadows per day and make sure that they get an inch of water each week. Tomatoes areone of the most common plantsyou'll find in American home gardens. Germinating tomato plants need a constant soil temperature of 65° to 80°F, and seeds should be planted six to eight weeks before your area’s projected last frost date. Given these requirements, you'll most likely have to start indoors (or buy tomato plants from your local garden center). First, you’ll need one container for every two seeds. (While it’s possible to raise all the seeds in the same pot, this makes the young plants harder to remove when the time comes to transplant them.) Plastic or Styrofoam cupswork well; make a couple small holes in the bottom of each one for drainage and fill the containers with a good potting mix. Then, place the seeds about a quarter of an inch beneath the surface. Mist the dirt with water (make it moist, but not soggy) and maintain a constant 70° to 80°F room temperature, and within 10 days, the little plants will sprout. They'll need plenty of sunlight; if possible, put the plants by asouth-facing windowor, in windowless rooms, use artificial grow lights. As soon as the plants sprout four leaves apiece, move them into bigger containers—pots with a height of 4 to 6 inches will be perfect. Meanwhile, find a nice, sunny section of your garden outside. One week before the last frost date, till the soil until it’s loose. Then, dig a trench about 6 or 8 inches deep. After the last frost date finally arrives and the dirt has warmed, throw in 3 inches of compost. Cover that with some extra soil and then transplant your seedlings there. Like pansies, tomatoes come in many varieties, which offer fruits of every shape and size. Depending on what kind you're growing, you’ll want to arrange the young plants anywhere from 12 to 48 inches apart. Consult the seed package or a neighborhood gardening store for an exact number. By the way, novice gardeners may want to choose varieties that yieldsmaller fruits(likecherry tomatoes). If left to their own devices, medium or large fruits may rot prematurely. Preventing this will require tethering your plants to stakes or cages for support. That’s not too difficult, but it is an extra step. Tomatoes and basil make for a great combination in spaghetti sauces, and in your garden, the two plants mayhelpeach other grow. According to many amateur and professional gardeners, basil serves as a natural bug repellent that drives off unwanted insects that might otherwise eat the herb—or munch on your tomato fruits. Some also speculate that planting the two near each other somehow gives the tomatoes a much better flavor. Garden-raised basil needs plenty of sunlight and should be arranged accordingly. Plant the seeds at least 12 inches apartsix weeks beforethe last frost comes along. Water them lightly whenever the soil feels dry and you’ll have a healthy plant that will keep giving you delicious leaves all summer long.Mangia! Mint, another hardy herb, is ridiculously easy to grow. In fact, mint does so well outdoors that the biggest challenge associated with it is keeping the plant fromtaking over your whole garden. But before we get into that, let’s talk logistics. Mint needs damp soil with good drainage, and it tends to do best when kept in an area that receives a moderate amount of shade during the day. Under favorable conditions, the herb’s specialized stems—known as “runners”—shoot out in all directions. Left unchecked, the runners will devour every inch of available real estate, sometimes conquering entire lawns in the process. For this reason, many people grow their outdoor mints in clay pots from which the roots can’t escape. But if you want to put yours in a multi-species garden, plant it on the inside of a long, tubular container with an open bottom and thick walls. An 18-inch metal stove pipe buried vertically with its uppermost inch poking out above the surface would be perfect. Patio edges and driveways can also beeffective root barriers. Whether you’re hungry for their seeds or just like to look at them,sunflowersare a terrific choice for first-time gardeners. They don’t need much in the way of fertilizing, they can thrive in all but the soggiest soils, and they’re extremely adept at weathering droughts. As the common name implies, these flowers do require direct, unimpeded sunlight. Plant yours out in the open, and be sure to keep them a fair distance away from any other plants you might be cultivating, as a row of tall sunflowers can throw unwanted shade onto neighboring veggies. To get started, wait until the last frost date has passed in the spring and thenplant your seedsin 1-inch holes. For best results, space these at least 6 inches apart—or, if you’re dealing with a larger species, up that figure to 24 inches. Water well after planting. An idealcool-weather crop, radishes develop spicy bulbs during the chillier months of spring and autumn. Arrange the seeds at least an inch apart in half an inch of loose, moist, and well-lit dirt. They'll grow fast: Certain radishes may be ready for harvest just 22 days after planting, although other varieties may need up to 70. Once yours begin sprouting leaves, thin out the rows by plucking every other radish. A new row may beplantedin early spring or late summer, depending on when you plan to dig your vegetables up and eat them. The average American eatsmore than 100 poundsof these tasty tubers per year. With spud cultivation, you don’t have to worry about planting seeds. Instead, the objective here is to find apotato tuberthat’s grown a few buds that are around one quarter to one third of an inch in length. Cut the potato into chunks, leaving at least one bud on each segment. Before you move on from there, store these wedges indoors at room temperature for 48 to 72 hours. If you’ve got a lot of space to work with, you can grow potatoes in vast rows across your backyard. (For instructions on how to do that,see here.) But if space is limited, you can cultivate potato plants in bottomless half-bushel baskets. Alternatively, as Janice Stillman of theOld Farmer’s Almanacexplains inthis video, a trash can with some holes drilled into the base also make for effective containers. In any event, you’ll need to start out shortly after the last spring frost. Take your barrel or basket and place it in a sunny locale. Fill it with loamy potting soil and bury the chunks 2 to 4 inches beneath the surface. Give them an inch of water every week and they’ll be ready to harvest by midsummer. Home-madeFrench friesormashed potatoes, here we come! Popeye’s favorite food is one of the best cold-weather crops a gardener could ask for. Four to six weeks before the last frost date in your area, you'll need to kick things off by following a process called priming:Soak some seedsin water for 24 hours. Take them out and let them dry off on a paper towel for a day or two, then seal the seeds in an airtight zip-lock bag and keep them in a cool room for up to one week. When their week-long stint in a cool room is up, sow the seeds in an inch oftilled soilthat has a temperature below 70°F. You can startharvesting your spinach leaveswhenever they reach the desired size. As far as flower-growing is concerned, marigolds definitely fall into the fool-proof category. Waitto plant their seedsuntil after the spring frosts have come to an end. Just about any bedding type will suit them, although moist, well-drained soils are preferable. Marigold enthusiasts usually get their seeds by purchasing them in packets, which come with specific instructions about spacing and other topics. Cover the seeds with a small amount of dirt, don’t let the soil get too dry, and uproot some of the seedlings as needed. In exchange for this minimal effort, you’ll get vibrant flowers that will stick around until football season. Not only are zucchinis super easy to grow, they’re also amazingly prolific. Within a few short weeks, your garden will be churning out enough to feed a small army. To get going, dig a row of inch-deep holes in the earth at some point between early spring and midsummer (although in practice, one or two plants will probably be enough). The depressions should be spaced about 3 feet apart, with each crater housing two or three seeds. Make sure the dirt is warm and keep it moist at all times (regular mulchingwill help you with that).

40,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/75068/11-facts-about-glacier-national-park,,"Glacier National Park, established May 11, 1910, boasts over a million acres of America’s most awe-inspiring wilderness. More than 3 million people visited its snow-covered peaks in 2021, making Glacier the27th-most-visited parkin thenational park system. So what exactly makes the place so alluring? It could be the turquoise lakes, the mountains, or maybe the unprecedented wildlife biodiversity. Here are a few reasons why people continue to visit this jewel in Montana. Glacier National Park and Canada’s Waterton Lakes National Park were established as the firstinternational peace parkin 1932. After early management agreed that the upper Waterton Valley shouldn’t be divided between the U.S. and Canada, the two parks joined together as a symbol of goodwill, with both sides working with each other to preserve this wilderness. Every year since,Rotarianshave performed an annual symbolicritualwhere they shake hands at the border and ""pledge not to take up arms against each other."" The wildlife is one of the reasons that Glacier earned aUNESCO World Heritage Sitedesignation in 1995. Because of its acreage and early protection efforts, the park has maintained nearly all of its original animal species present before Europeans visited the area. The only mammals that no longer roam this part of Montana arewoodland caribou and bison. Given the diversity of flora and fauna across the park, it should come as no surprise that Glacier National Park is often called the “crown of the continent.” Naturalist and historian George Bird Grinnell [PDF], who led the efforts to establish Glacier National Park, coined this name in the early 20th century. Mountain goats are among the park’s most famous residents. These hardy animals are so prevalent that they are Glacier’s official symbol. One of the best places to spot the agile animals is at the Goat Lick Overlook, a mineral lick located in the southern part of the park. After the area's designation as a national park in 1910, an increasing number of tourists made the trek to the mountains. To accommodate the crowds, theGreat Northern Railwayconstructed a series of chalets and hotels that were designed to mimic lodges in Switzerland. These designs, combined with the use of natural materials, were dubbed “parkitecture.” Though WWII caused many of the lodgings to fall into disrepair, some of the buildings were saved and are registered as national historic landmarks. Triple Divide Peakhas the unique distinction of sending water to the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. The Continental Divide and Northern Divide, which direct water flow to the oceans, converge at the peak’s summit. This means that any water that falls on Triple Divide Peak will flow to the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean (by way of the Gulf of Mexico), or Arctic Ocean (by way of Hudson Bay, which is sometimes considered part of the Arctic Ocean). Woodenboat tourshave been a feature of Glacier National Park since the 1920s, and many of the original boats still cruise today. Among the oldest is theSinopah, a 45-foot vessel that carries visitors on Two Medicine Lake; andLittle Chief, a 49-passenger boat found at Saint Mary Lake. U.S. national parks introduced tour buses in the 1930s in an effort to reduce car traffic. While the buses were eventually phased out at other parks, Glacier continued to offer tours inthe historic ""red jammer"" buses, so called because drivers could be heardjamming the gearsgoing up and down the mountain passes. The refurbished fleet of 1930's buses continues to take guests to Glacier's notable sights and across the park on Going-to-the-Sun Road. Traveling east to west,Going-to-the-Sun Roadis a 50-mile scenic drive through the park. The road, which was opened in 1933 with all the major structures finished in 1937, has received several distinctive honors, including being registered as a national historic place, national historic landmark, and historic civil engineering landmark. The road also appeared in the opening credits of 1980’sThe Shining. Although the park receives an average annual snowfall of around 138 inches, Glacier has a long history of wildfires. The park recorded 64 fires in 1936 and experienced a severe fire season in 2003, when13 percentof the park’s land burned. Located along Waterton Lake, Goat Haunt is considered the center of Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. Visitors wishing to cross the border into either country need to present their ID before receiving a mountain goat-shaped stamp on their passports.

If you use your favorite pair of sneakers every day, normal wear and tear will eventually lead to holes that are too big to ignore. At that point, once-useful footwear becomes waste that sits in a landfill for centuries. One company has responded to this issue by selling shoes that are made to degrade and give life to new plants. AsEarth.comreports, the shoes fromJohnny Footwearare designed to be planted in the ground at the end of their lifespan. The product consists of simple materials, like water-resistant cotton coated with beeswax and cushiony cork for the insoles. The most revolutionary component of the shoe, however, may be the biodegradable midsole. In many tennis shoes, the midsoles are made fromethylene vinyl acetate. The majority of a shoe might break down inthree to four decades, but midsoles made from this material can stick around for up to 1000 years. Johnny Footwear's midsoles are designed to fully decompose within three years.Biodegradeableisn't a descriptor most people look for when shopping for shoes, but Johnny Footwear promises its shoes won't disintegrate while you're wearing them. The sneakers are designed to degrade gradually underground—not on your feet. The company is named after Johnny Appleseed, the legendary figure who planted apple trees across America, and every pair of shoes it sells contains a nod to its namesake. An apple seed is embedded in the arch area, and as the shoe breaks down, the seed is released into the earth. The fertilizer casing around the seed encourages it to germinate within a few years of being planted. And for every pair of shoes sold, the company pledges to plant an additional tree on the customer's behalf. After successfully raising $73,000 onKickstarterlast year, Johnny Footwear plans to start shipping its shoes in August of 2022.

These succulents can be shaped like gumdrops or tiny hearts, and they range in color from watermelon pink to sage green. Many sellers say theplantis rare, which is true; wildConophytumplants only grow in southern Africa, and several species in the genus are endangered. Fewer listings say where the succulent was sourced. Conophytumis one group of succulents poachers are targeting to meet the high demand for unusual houseplants. Roughly a third of the world’s succulent species grow in South Africa, and asThe New York Timesreported in July 2021, the illegal plant trade has become a threat to the country’s ecosytems in recent years. The U.S. has attracted a wave of succulent poachers as well.Dudleya, a genus of succulents whose plump leaves grow in petal-like patterns, is native to California. In September 2021, the state passed a law banning unauthorizedDudleyapicking from the wild. That law was exercised in January 2022, when a South Korean man was sentenced to two years in prison for poaching hundreds of thosands of dollars' worth of the plants from the coast. Experts blame the thriving succulent black market on the current houseplant craze. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people looking for ways to brighten their living space became new plant parents. In 2020,interest in buying plantsnearly doubled, according tosearch data. Amassing rare and interesting specimens is also easier than ever.Online groups and marketplacesallow collectors to buy plants from around the world, and these same platforms let sellers profit off illegally harvested plants discreetly. Some reports saysucculent enthusiasts in South Koreaare fueling illicit activity, but experts are skeptical. While researching his new bookThe Succulent Subject: A Political Ecology of Plants, Desire and Illicit Trade, Jared Margulies found little evidence of illegalDudleyaplants in the country. As he toldVox, he suspects the succulents are sometimes shipped to South Korea before being exported to other markets, such as China, the UK, and even their place of origin in the U.S. Vulnerable plant species rarely receive the same attention as endangered animals. California’s ban onDudleyaharvesting is one of only three laws aimed at plant poaching in the U.S. (The other two are designed to protect saguaro cacti andVenus flytraps, respectively). A poachedConophytumbud may not elicit the same emotional response as a tusk of ivory, but it’s still cause for concern. The range of these plants is relatively small, which means they could be driven to the brink of extinction by just a few poaching sprees. Succulents are an important food source for pollinators like birds and insects, and their roots help maintain healthy, stable soil in the arid environments where they flourish. If they're not protected, the effects of their loss would ripple across ecosystems. Harsh laws can be an effective deterrent for criminals, but they don't necessarily tackle the crux of the problem. The people getting arrested and punished for plant poaching are often middlemen earning a fraction of the profits from their hauls. They’re sent to prison, and meanwhile, the people who hired them are able to continue with their business. Another way to fight succulent poaching is by raising consumer awareness. Buyers may assume that every plant they see for sale online was harvested legally, but, sadly, that isn’t the case. The best way to be sure that your plant hobby is ethical is by shopping at reputable retailers and independent nurseries. Purchasing succulents online from places like Facebook, eBay, and Etsy requires a little extra research. If a seller is boasting about how rare their specimen is, they should be able to say where it came from."

On Monday, February 14, Germany, Sudan, Uganda, New Zealand, and Lebanon sent samples of important crops to the bank on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen. The Lebanese contribution comes from the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas, or ICARDA. In 2015, ICARDA become the first group to withdraw material from the bank to replenishseeds destroyed in the Syrian War.

The Svalbard Global Seed Bank began operating in 2008 as a physical backup drive for the world's crops. The 11,000-square-foot facility is built into the side of an Arctic mountain, the hope being that its remote location in the frozen tundra will spare it from wars and rising temperatures threatening plants elsewhere on the planet.

According toPublic Goods, you can make your shaving routine more eco-friendly by bringing your used razors to a recycling center. Yourlocal recycling centeris a great place to bring hazardous or hard-to-process materials that can't go in your recycling bin at home. Many places in your community, like fire stations, hospitals, and pharmacies, are equipped to collect these trickier recyclables as well. You can use the online toolEarth 911to search for collection centers by zip code and material type. Unlike old cellphones ormagazines, a few months' worth of razor blades can be hard to store and transport. Razor banks are specially made for disposing of the items safely. When the box starts to get full, you can drop it off at your local recycling center and start filling a new one. Some pharmacies even have containers for sharp disposables they're willing to give out for free. If you want to be really thrifty, try making your own razor banks using items you have at home. An empty mint tin is ideal for keeping old blades secure until it's time to recycle them. Many plants are only equipped to process one material at a time, which means razor blades that can't be separated from their plastic handles or cartridges are even harder to recycle. Gillette addressed this issue by teaming up withTerraCycleto launch their own razor recycling program. You can use TerraCycle's online map to find drop-off locations near you that accept blades, razors, and rigid plastic packaging. If there's no participating center in your area, you can ship boxes of old shaving equipment by requesting a tracking code through your TerraCycle account. With a little extra effort, you can recycle many of the items that most people throw away. Here are dozens ofthings you didn't know you could recycle. [h/tPublic Goods]"

On that day in 1997, a giant wave swept4.8 million LEGO piecesinto waters 20 miles off the coast of Cornwall in the UK. A quarter of a century later, the tiny plastic toys are still washing up on England's southwestern shores. According toSmithsonian, the Great LEGO Spill is considered the worst-ever toy-related environmental catastrophe. It occurred when a cargo ship namedTokio Expresswas transporting goods from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to New York. A 28-foot wave toppled 62 shipping containers off the vessel, dumping items like superglue and disposable lighters into the sea. One box heldLEGO sets, that—in a strange twist—were largely nautical-themed. That's the casualty that has gotten the most attention in the 25 years since the incident. Beachcombers continue to find miniature flippers, harpoons, andoctopusesin the sand to this day. Though the LEGO recoveries have beenconcentrated in Cornwall, American oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer estimated that the pieces could have drifted 62,000 miles across the world's oceans. Roughly 3.2 million of the lost LEGOs are light enough to float, which means the other 1.6 million have likely ended up on the seabed. They are destined to stay there for a while; according to a2020 study, it will take 1300 years for the LEGOs lost at sea to fully break down. The 1997 accident isn't the first disaster of its kind.

They're cute,endlessly entertainingand, unlike dogs, don't require constant attention. But what do cats do when they're not curling up in your lap? According to biologists, they're off killing other animals — billions of 'em. Scientists from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and the Fish and Wildlife Service estimate that each year, apparently bloodthirsty felines are preying on billions of birds and small mammals like indigenous chipmunks, shrews, and meadow voles. ""When we ran the model, we didn't know what to expect,""researcher Dr. Peter Marra told theNew York Times. ""We were absolutely stunned by the results."" The model, which crunches numbers from 21 existing studies, is the first of its kind in the United States, and follows on the heels ofa controversial plan in New Zealand to eliminate the nation's cats. Here's a look at our killer cats, by the numbers: House cats in the United States Birds killed by a typical house cat every year Small mammals killed by a typical house cat every year Free-roaming, feral cats estimated to be living in the United States. They either survive alone or live in colonies. In Washington, D.C., for example, there are estimated to be some 300 outdoor cat colonies.

49,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/655614/recycled-poop-uses,,"The average person produces about a pound ofpoopa day. Where does it all go? The answer depends onwhere you live. If you have aflushing toilet, your metabolic output spirals down the underground pipes to massive wastewater plants that clean the water and dispose of the rest the best they can—by destroying or landfilling it. In places where flushing systems aren’t possible, residents build cesspits and outhouses, where sludge accumulates and eventually needs to be emptied. Because excrement spreads diseases, people put a lot of effort into getting rid of it as quickly as humanly possible. But now, scientists and engineers are telling us that we’ve beenwasting our own waste. When recycled properly, this cheap, fully renewable, and readily available substance, regularly produced by all 7 billion of us living on this planet, can grow food, cook dinner, fuelcars, and generate electricity. Here are a few cutting-edge technologies that are already upcycling people’s poop—and may get to yours soon. The urban settlements of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, are so overcrowded that there’s no space left for building toilets, including the simplest outdoor latrines. But peoplestill have to go somewhere. So the residents relieve themselves into plastic bags, tossing them to the side of the road where they accumulate, spread, and float around the next time a torrential downpour floods the area. The bag phenomenon even has a name: It’s called “Kenya’s flying toilets.” At the same time, Kenya has a huge deforestation problem. Wood is the only sources of energy available to most, so people cut down trees and convert wood to charcoal, used for anything from cooking dinners to drying tea leaves for the country’s tea industry. A startup namedSanivationhas stepped in to fix both problems with the same substance. Sanivation provides low-income households with small porta-potties that accumulate waste in hygienic containers underneath the toilet seats, which a service team then collects and takes to their repurposing site. Human excreta contain a lot of lignin—a complex organic polymer that comes from the cell walls of plants we eat. When heated, that lignin transforms poop into a sticky substance. If you throw more burnable fiber—such as sawdust or agricultural refuse—into that sticky mix, the result can be shaped and dried into fuel briquettes. The demand from factories is enormous, according to Sanivation founder Emily Woods—during their fourth month of selling “poop logs,” they sold 50 tons. “We are only limited by how much we can produce,” she says. Transforming manually collected feces into firewood likely won’t find a big market in the Western world, but there are other ways to reuse our metabolic output here. Ajay Singh, a scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, noticed a lot of big trucks buzzing around his city on a regular basis. It turned out the trucks were hauling human waste. Typically, this sewage is then dewatered, and that water is purified enough to let it out back to nature—but the remaining biosolids are a sticky issue. Often, biosolids are dumped into landfills or incinerated, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. And in some locales, they're channeled into so-called “lagoons”—essentially massive cesspits slowly seething underneath their PVC covers. Biosolids are sort of a hot potato in the sewage world: No one wants them because they're too gunky, chunky, and stinky to pump or purify them like liquid. But they're also high in nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, which are excellent fertilizers. With a colleague, Singh figured out a way to purée biosolids into a “sewage smoothie.” They built an industrial-size blender that whips up the biosolids into the consistency of a milkshake. (To test the idea, they first experimented with a regular kitchen blender, but please don’t try this at home!) With an ultra-sharp blade that spins so fast that it shears the bacterial cells present in the sludge, the blender solves two problems at once: It kills the pathogens and homogenizes the mix to the point that it can be pumped into trucks that take it out to farmlands and inject it into the soil. Today, their companyLystekwhips biosolids into a bio-fertilizer mix called LysteGro—a nutrient-rich health food for plants. DC Water, the wastewater plant in our country’s capital, has another kitchen-inspired approach to upcycling poop—not in a blender but a pressure cooker. The plant uses 24 colossal pressure cookers to simmer the city’s output at 320°F and six times the regular atmospheric pressure you’re feeling right now for half an hour. At the end of this cycle, all the pathogens are dead and the sewage stew is loaded up into massive concrete tanks called biodigesters, where multitudes of microbes chew through (or “digest”) the sludge. In the process, they burp out methane, which the company collects and burns to spin the plant’s electrical turbines. Prior to digestion, DC Water produced 1100 tons of biosolids per day. Now, the mighty microbes reduce it to about 450 tons a day, with the difference being converted to gas for green energy production. Some of the carbon gets returned to the earth from which it came: At the end of their feast, the microbes leave behind a form of black gooey compost, which is dewatered and dried up into an organic fertilizer product packaged into neat bags and called Bloom, available for purchase by anyone, from farmers to landscapers to gardeners. It’s a perfect example of why we shouldn’t be wasting our waste, says Christopher Peot, DC Water’s director of resource recovery: “There’s no such thing as waste, only wasted resources.” A massive pressure cooker isn’t something an average household can afford, but there are smaller and cheaper biodigester options. Israeli companyHomeBiogasmakes affordable personal biodigesters that can “digest” food leftovers in a similar way. They can also be attached to pump toilets, which use manual pumps to flush and thus require significantly less water. The digesters, which look a bit like camels resting on the ground, are seeded with specific microbes that decompose biomass and convert it into methane, which travels through a hose to a stove or a hot-water heater. And from the digester’s rear drips the other valuable output—a brown, goopy liquid that can be a potent fertilizer and which slowly accumulates in a bucket. For countries where energy is expensive, HomeBiogas digesters (costing about $600-$700) can offer real savings, according to one of the company’s founders, Yair Teller. For the United States, where energy is cheap, the biodigesters may be a source of inexpensive organic fertilizer. And they also may be a boon for off-the-grid communities regardless of their geographical location. Imagine growing your food and cooking it with your own dung! Besides kitchen stoves, excrement can fuel just about anything, including cars. TheMetro Vancouver wastewater plantin British Columbia is testing a new technology that converts sewage into a form of crude oil. Developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL), one of the United States Department of Energy’s labs, the complex apparatus’s centerpiece is a slick, silver serpentine pipe. When loaded inside the pipe, the sludge is heated to about 660°F and squished at 200 times the normal air pressure. These hellish conditions, called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) in scientific terms, mimic those that had forged oil and gas deep in the bottom of the world’s oceans over millions of years. At such temperatures and pressures the sludge doesn’t cook per se, but its long organic molecules break into shorter, smaller carbon compounds, which comprise oil and gas. The difference is that Mother Nature takes millions of years to do it while the PNNL technology takes 15 minutes. Essentially, you load in stinky black goo, and you extract stinky black goo, but the difference is that the outflowing goo has a high economic value. It still needs to be refined like any oil, says Paul Kadota, Metro Vancouver’s program manager, but it helps with sewage disposal and it reduces the amount of oil that must be extracted from earth, because we still depend on fossil fuels. The project is in pilot phase, but if it works, Vancouver residents would be quite literally powering their cars with yesterday’s dinner."

If you've been a driver for few decades, you may have noticed that the remains of unlucky flies, moths, and beetles don't end up on windshields as often as they once did. You may even be grateful that your vehicle is cleaner than it used to be, but the lack of bugs on the road isn't something to celebrate. The trend is known as thewindshield phenomenon, and it's evidence of rapidly declining insect populations around the world. People have been noticing fewer bugs on their windshields since theearly 2000s, but until the 2010s, there was little scientific evidence to back up these anecdotal observations. Some of theearliest data on the subjectcomes from the Krefeld Entomological Society, which is composed mostly of amateur entomologists. They first started tracking insect populations in nature reserves throughout western Europe in the 1980s, and in 2013, they made a startling finding. Insect populations in one trapping site had declined by close to 80 percent since they last checked it in 1989. When they went back the following year, the numbers hadn't rebounded. Investigations across more than a dozen additional sites showed that the trend wasn't limited to one area. More Articles About Cars: A 2019 survey by the Kent Wildlife Trust directly linked the so-called ""insect apocalypse"" to what drivers are noticing (or aren't noticing) on their windshields. After following more than 650 car trips taken across the British county of Kent in the summer of 2019, they asked drivers to report the number of dead bugs that ended up on their car's license plate. They compared these numbers to the results of a similar survey from 2004, and found that the average splattered insect count had dropped by 50 percent. Some people blamed the windshield phenomenon on the more aerodynamic designs of modern cars. To account for this, the Kent Wildlife Trust researchers found drivers with classic cars for their survey. Their findings suggest that the change over a 15-year period came from the environment—not car designs. Multiple factors have contributed to plummeting insect populations. Bug species have been hit hard by numeroushuman-caused threatsover the past century, including industrial farming, insecticides, and climate change. The windshield phenomenon is one effect of the crisis people may notice in their day-to-day lives. Other consequences of the insect apocalypse are much more dire. Insects don't always get as much attention from conservationists as charismatic megafauna, but they play a vital role in the world's ecosystems.Animal pollinators—such as bees, moths, beetles, and butterflies—are responsible for pollinating over a third of the planet's food crops.

In honor ofEarth Day,which we'll celebrate on April 22, here are a few things you may have been throwing out that, with a little effort, you can actuallyrecycleto help theenvironment. Grandpa's choppers may hold recyclable precious metals, includinggold,silver, and palladium. TheJapan Denture Recycling Associationis known to collect false teeth, remove and recycle the metals, and discard the rest of the denture (which is illegal to reuse). The program has donated all of its earnings to UNICEF. Got burnt-outholiday lights? The folks atHolidayLEDs.comwill gladly take your old lights, shred them, and sort the remaining PVC, glass, and copper. Those raw materials are taken to another recycling center to be resurrected. They're made of plastic and metal, but razors are generally not accepted by curbside recycling programs. You can mail your used razors, blades, and plastic packaging (of any brand) toTerraCycle, which has partnered with Gillette to recycle the products' components. Not all hotels throw out that half-used soap you left in the shower: Some send it toClean the World. There, soap is soaked in a sanitizing solution, treated to a steam bath, and then tested for infections. Once deemed safe, the soap is distributed to communities across the globe. So stop stealing soap from hotels—you may be stealing from charity. You don't need to dump your old box spring at the landfill. Because they're equipped with special saws,mattress recycling factoriescan separate the wood, metal, foam, and cloth. The metal springs are magnetically removed, the wood is chipped, and the cloth and foam are shredded and baled. In its future life, your saggy mattress could become a cute sundress or even wallpaper. Recycling options varyby state. When you’re finished making French fries at home, it can be tempting to toss the spent frying oil down the drain. But you shouldn’t—nearly halfof all sewer overflows are caused by fat and oil. There are a few curbside programs in the United States that accept used cooking oil, and municipal waste transfer stations may also accept it. The used oil will usually be sent to a biodiesel plant that will transform it into fuel. Theaverage babysoils 6000 diapers before being potty trained—that's onetonof diapers rotting in a landfill per child. But not all poo-packages have to suffer this fate. The companyKnowastecollects and recycles dirty diapers at hospitals, nursing facilities, and public restrooms. After sanitizing the diaper with a solution, they mechanically separate the ""organic matter"" from the diaper's plastic, which is compressed into pellets and recycled into roof shingles. Meanwhile, paper pulp in diapers grows up to become wallpaper and shoe soles. CDs are made of polycarbonate plastic and won't decompose at a landfill. But if you send your discs to the e-waste recyclerGreenDisk, they'll shred them into a fine powder that will be later melted down into a plastic perfect for automotive and building materials—even pavement! Send your beat-up sneaks toNike Grindand you'll help build a running track. Nike's recycling facility rips apart worn shoes, separating the rubber, foam, and fabric. The rubber is melted down for running track surfaces, the foam is converted into tennis court cushioning, and the fabric is used to pad basketball court floorboards. Many municipal waste transfer stations also accept shoes in their textile recycling bins. Why turn animal poop into fertilizer, manure, or trash when you can make it into a greeting card? Or a bouquet of artificial flowers? The folks atPoopooPaperdo that, plus more—they can transform thepoopof a wide variety of herbivores (cows, horses, elephants, and more) into cards, bookmarks, keychains, magnets, and jewelry. Is your room full of plastic bowling trophies from fifth grade? If the thrill of victory fades, you can recycle your old trophies the Maryland-based companyLamb Awards. They'll break down your retired awards, melting them down or reusing them for new trophies. If it weren't for legal complications, America's obsession with cosmetic surgery could solve its energy problem. In 2008, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon lost his job when police caught him fueling his car with a biofuel created from his patients'liposuctioned fat. (Convicting him wasn't hard, since he advertised the substance online as ""LipoDiesel."") That's not the first time fat has powered transportation: In 2007, conservationist Peter Bethune used 2.5 gallons of human fat to fuel his eco-boat,Earthrace. Foilis probably one of the most thrown-away recyclable materials out there. (Americans throw away about 1.5 million tons of aluminum products every year, according to theEPA.) But foil is100-percent aluminum, and as long as you thoroughlyclean itof any food waste, you technically should be able to recycle it with your aluminum cans (but first check with your local recycling plant to ensure they’re equipped to process it; some aren’t). Don't toss those stubbyCrayolas! Instead, mail them to theNational Crayon Recycle Program, which takes unloved, broken crayons to a better place: They're melted in a vat of wax, remade, and resold. So far, the program has saved more than 120,000 pounds of crayons. More than 10 million tons of shingles are disposed each year. Most of them are made out of asphalt, which is why more than two dozen states pulverize the old shingles and recycle them intopavement. For every ton of shingles recycled, we save one barrel of oil. When Fluffy bites the dust in Germany, you can memorialize your beloved pet by recycling her. In Germany, it's illegal to burypetsin public places. This leaves some pet owners in a bind when their furry friends die. A rendering plant near the town of Neustadt an der Weinstraße acceptsdeceased pets; animal fat is recycled into glycerin, which is used in cosmetics such as lip balm. You can—and should—properly dispose of expired prescription drugs. But what about unneeded pills that are still good?Some stateslet you donate unused drugs back to pharmacies. Some charities also accept leftover HIV medicine from Americans who have switched prescriptions, stopped medicating, or passed away. These drugs are shipped overseas and distributed to people with HIV around the world. Fishing line is made from monofilament, a non-biodegradable plastic that you can't put in your everyday recycling bin. AtBerkley Fishing, old fishing line is mixed with other recyclables (like milk cartons and plastic bottles) and transformed into fish-friendly habitats. So far, Berkley has saved and recycled more than 9 million miles of fishing line. Your recycling center probably doesn't accept wine corks, but companies likeTerracyclewill. They turn cork into flat sheets of tile, which you can use for flooring, walls, and veneer. Another company, ReCORK, has extended the life of over 4 million unloved corks by giving them toSOLE, a Canadian sandal maker. Most pantyhose are made of nylon, a recyclable thermoplastic that takes more than 40 years to decompose. Companies likeSwedish Stockingsgrind old nylons down so the material can be made into industrial pipes and furniture. If you buy a plastic toothbrush fromPreserve(which makes its toothbrushes from oldStonyfield Farmsyogurt cups and other everyday items), it will take back your used toothbrush and give it a new life—this time as a piece of plastic lumber. The companyreBouncesgives old tennis balls a second life. If you’ve got at least 200 balls in relatively good shape sitting around, the company will send you a prepaid shipping label to help get the box on the road and repressurize the balls. For those that are totally worn out, the company will reuse the rubbery material topave new tennis courts. Most yoga mats are made from PVC, the same material in plumbing pipes, heavy-duty tarps, and rain boots. While many local yoga studios will accept well-loved mats and find them a new home, the companySanukhas an appropriately squishy vision for each mat’s future: It will transform your old yoga mat into flip flops and sandals. All governments have a way of dealing with old, worn money. (In 2016, the Indian government shredded old bills and turned them intohardboard.) But what about currency that is no longer legal tender? It turns out you can donate your old French francs, Spanish pesetas, or Dutch guilders toParkinsons UK, who will recycle the old coins and banknotes. All of the pet fur on your sweaters, couches, and carpet could help save the ocean from oil spills. Hair is excellent at sopping up oil from the environment (hairball booms were used to soak up oil from the 2010 BP oil spill), so non-profit organizations such as the San Francisco-basedMatter of Trustwill accept pet fur to make oil-absorbing mats of Fido's fuzz. A version of this story ran in 2019; it has been updated for 2022."
52,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/650686/baby-poop-full-of-microplastics,,"New parents know that surprises abound in a baby’s diaper. But according to new research, it’s what you can’t see (or smell) that could be a cause for alarm. Infant fecal mattercontainsa lot of plastic. In astudypublished inEnvironmental Science & Technology Letters, scientists at the New York University School of Medicine braved the task of examining retrieved babypoopfrom six 1-year-old infants by running it through a filter to trap microplastics. They discovered it harbored a median of 36,000 nanograms of polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, a common plastic, per gram of feces. That was roughly 10 times the amount found in the 10 samples of adult waste they analyzed. The researchers estimated that a baby is exposed to an average of 83,000 nanograms of PET per kilo of body weight each day. How does PET wind up in poop? The plastic is practicallyeverywhere, from carpet fibers to the plastic bottles used for baby formula to toys. It’s also found in bedding and clothing. Because babies are explorers, low to the ground and tactile, they seem to be at greater risk of exposure. Eating, drinking, crawling, or even gumming a LEGO could be a potential pathway to either swallow or inhale tiny amounts of the plastic. They even found amounts in the very first feces of newborns. There are some caveats. The pilot study looked at poop from three newborns, six infants, and 10 adults, which is not an appreciably large sample from which to draw firm conclusions. But considering how pervasive PET is in modern life, it’s safe to say babies are probably being exposed to plenty of it. (And not from diapers, which are made from polypropylene.) Should it be a cause for worry? Science isn’t sure yet. Microplastics contain over 10,000 chemicals, some of which are known to be harmful and some that are still poorly understood. They can also accumulate heavy metals. It’s possible plastics could interrupt normal endocrine, hormonal, or neurological development, making their presence in baby discharge concerning. Even though it comes out in waste, there’s potential for it to be absorbed by the body. One easy way to reduce a baby’s exposure is to skip heating plastic bottles for formula. Use a glass bottle instead. You can also avoid food wrapped in plastic. But totally eliminating exposure in the modern world is going to be a tall order. [h/tWired]"
53,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/650565/tips-growing-giant-pumpkin,,"Pumpkins can reach truly massive proportions. TheGuinness World Recordfor heaviest pumpkin of all time belongs to a German specimen that weighed2644.6 poundsin 2016. If you're looking for a gourd that rivals the world's biggest, you won't find it at the supermarket. The best way to get your hands on a giant pumpkin is by growing it yourself—and if you start now, it may be ready by Halloween 2022. A monster pumpkin starts with a tiny seed, but it can't be any pumpkin seed.Modern Farmerrecommends planting Dill's Atlantic Giant—the variety that has produced nearly all the record-smashing pumpkins of recent decades. If grown under ideal conditions, these seeds can produce pumpkins between 300 and 500 pounds. Start preparing to grow your giant pumpkin in the fall. In your garden, till a 10-foot-diameter bed that receives at least eight hours of sunlight per day. Spread six inches of composted manure over the soil and shape it into a low, wide mound. Cover the bed with straw mulch or a cover crop until you're ready to plant your pumpkins in a few months. In late winter or early spring—roughly a month before the last frost of winter—germinate your pumpkin seeds in indoor pots.Air temperaturesshould fall between 65°F to 75°F and soil temperatures should be 70°F to 90°F. Once your seedling has sprouted a few leaves, plant it in the prepared bed in your garden. If you have more than one seedling, space them out at least 10 feet apart. Covering the area around the sprout with plastic in the early spring can protect it from cold weather and encourage early growth. Moisture, sun, and nutrients are essential to cultivating large pumpkins. The soil should always be moist, and the patch should be located in a bright, sunny spot without any shade. A weekly feeding of nutrients will help it gain a lot of bulk in a short amount of time. Wind, pests, and weeds pose a threat to pumpkins, so monitor the conditions around the plot and install afenceor use insecticides and fungicides if necessary. Though it may seem counterintuitive, it's important to pluck flower buds from your vine when it's first starting to grow. This allows theleavesto grow big enough to collect energy for one, giant pumpkin instead of several tiny ones. When your vine is about 10 feet long, leave any budding flowers alone for a few weeks. The biggest fruit at the end of this period will be your giant pumpkin, and the rest can be pruned. Giant pumpkins have unique needs to keep in mind. They're prone to rot, and a bed of sand or a sheet of wood or cardboard beneath them offers protection from moisture and insects. The skin of a 300-pound pumpkin is stretched to its limit, and erecting a shade cloth over the fruit keeps its exterior flexible as it expands. Also, make sure to prune any rootlets preventing the vine near the pumpkin from lifting off the ground as it grows larger. Branching vines that produce leaves promote growth, but vines that are longer than eight feet may consume more energy than they harness for the pumpkin and should be removed. With some luck and hard work, your giant pumpkin should be ready to harvest by the end of fall. The crop won't make very goodpumpkin pie, but it might win you a blue ribbon at your local fair. Here aremore usesfor pumpkins of any size this Halloween season."
54,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653017/giant-african-land-snail-facts,,"There are about 43,000living snail species. Three of them have become invasive pests inChina,Colombia,India,Barbados,Hawaii, and many other corners of the world:Achatina achatina,Archachatina marginata, andLissachatina fulica(a.k.a.Achatina fulica)—a trio better known asgiant African land snails. Native to East Africa, the snails can do a lot of damage when they’re introduced to foreign habitats. Here’s what you need to know about these monster mollusks. Whorled, striped, and brownish overall, the shells can measure up to 8 inches long and nearly 5 inches in diameter. According to theUSDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, that’s “about the size of an average [human] adult fist.” India’s giant Africanland snail problembegan in 1847. Some of the pioneering snails were probablyhitchhikersthat entered the subcontinent on shipments of timber. Others got an assist from exotic animal-lovers; a blacksmith who reportedly keptL. fulicaas pets may have helped them invade the Indian state of Bihar during the 1960s. Giant African land snails made their way to Florida in 1966, when a boy brought three of the snails home from a trip to Hawaii, where they were already invasive. His grandmother laterset them free. Peanuts, cucumbers, cocoa, and peas are just some of the commercial crops that giant African land snails devour. They can eatover 500 kinds of plants, including lichens, algae, and fungi. Giant African land snails may be predominantly herbivorous, but their shells need a steady supply ofcalciumto grow. To get it, the snails feed on bones, eggshells, oyster shells, and the shells ofother snails. They’ll even eathuman-made calcium sourceslike stucco, concrete, and paint—much to the horror of homeowners. Therat lungworm(Angiostrongylus cantonensis) uses snails to complete its life cycle. The adult worms both live and reproduce inside commonrat species, such as black, brown, and cotton rats. The worm’s larvae end up in the host mammal’s poop and are eventually excreted. The feces are then eaten by scavenging snails. If one of the worm-carrying snails is later eaten by a rodent, the cycle continues. A 2015 survey of 50L. fulicasnails collected in Miami found that 18 of themharbored rat lungworms. The worms can cause eosinophilic meningitis in humans who eat the snails, either as part of a meal or by accidentally ingesting parts of the snails on grocery store produce. The illness can be fatal. The giant snails have female and malereproductive organsand are prolific breeders. One instance of mating can fertilizeseveral clutchesof eggs over a period of time. Because a single snail can produce 1200 eggs per year, giant African land snails can take over an environment quickly. Run over these invertebrates at your own risk. Their tough, sharp shells canblow out car tires—or turn into flying shrapnel when accidentally crushed by a lawnmower. Following their accidental introduction in 1966, giant African land snails practically took over south Florida. The state spentmore than $1 millionandsurveyednearly a million properties to find and eliminate them. The effort paid off: Over the next seven years, more than 18,000 specimens were wiped out. In 1975, Florida’s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services announced that the invasive giant snails had been fully eradicated [PDF]. Thesnails came backin 2011, likely in an illegal shipment intended for religious purposes. They first popped up in Miami-Dade County, then spread into neighboring Broward County. This time around, the state spent more than $24 million to get rid of them, and no new sightings have been reported in Floridasince 2017. In October 2021, the snails were againdeclared eradicatedby the state’s agriculture commissioner. Labrador retrieverstrained by the USDA were enlisted to sniff out the invasive pests. Some dogs foundliterally hundredsof the snails per week. Assisted by the puppers, Florida officials were able to find and eliminate more than 168,000 snails in the state’s most recent campaign."

It's estimated that a single bite from this Australian snake packs enough venom to kill 100 adult men. But despite being the most venomous snake on Earth, the inland taipan isn't necessarily the deadliest. According to Australia'sBillabong Sanctuary, zero deaths from the species have been recorded. Theinland taipanlives on the cracking clays and loams of south-western Queensland and north-eastern South Australia. Humans rarely pass through this arid environment, but when they do, the snakes don't bother them. Theshy serpentspends most of its time out of the harsh sun, only coming to the surface to bask and look for food in the early morning hours. Reptile keepers who handle the snakes describe them as gentle and easy-going creatures. Like most animals, inland taipans will fight back when threatened. They warn intruders to back off by scrunching the upper halves of their bodies into an S-shape and pointing their heads at their target. If the threat doesn't leave, they will strike—either once or multiple times. An inland taipan bite can cause headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, unconsciousness, and paralysis. One component of the venom that makes it so lethal is called a hyaluronidase enzyme. This encourages the body to absorb the toxins quickly. The median lethal dose of inland taipan venom for mice is just0.025 milligrams per kilogram—making it the most potent of any snake species. The inland taipan evolved to prey on small mammals, but it is dangerous to humans as well. If it doesn't receive immediate medical attention, one bite can lead to death. Though rare, attacks on people do happen. AnAustralian teenagerwas bitten by his pet inland taipan while trying to place it in its enclosure in 2017. He was taken to a hospital in time and fortunately survived, but his story is a lesson that you probably shouldn't bring the world's most venomous snake into your home—no matter how docile it seems to be."

Just a few weeks later, theapproval was rescinded—much to the relief ofconservationistsacross the globe who’d spent those weeks speaking out against it. The contingent included Leonardo DiCaprio, who publicized the issue on social media, even tagging Cameroon president Paul Biya in anInstagram postasking him to “Please help #SaveEboForest.” While DiCaprio could hardly be said to have caused the reversal himself, scientists at the UK’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, believe his efforts to raise awareness really did help save the forest. To express their gratitude, asVarietyreports, they’ve named one of the Ebo Forest’s newly classifiedtreesafter the actor/activist:Uvariopsis dicaprio. Their research on the species is published inPeerJ. The so-called “Leo tree,” a member of the Annonaceae family, is a tropical evergreen whose bright yellow flowers bloom right from its trunk. “This is a plant which, for a botanist, just jumps out at you,” Kew taxonomist Martin CheektoldNew Scientist. “It’s so spectacular.” It’s also critically endangered. Only about four dozen mature Leo trees have been identified in the Ebo Forest, and it’s not known to grow anywhere else.U. dicapriois just one of manyendangered speciesthat call Ebo home. Among them are Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees, Goliath frogs, forest elephants, and grey parrots. Logging activities in or near their habitats could put serious pressure on the populations, threatening the biodiversity of the forest at large.

In addition to transmitting chlamydia through sexual contact, female koalas can inadvertently pass it on to their offspring through theirpap, a type of very nutritious fecal matter that joeys consume once they’ve grown out of breastfeeding (but aren’t yet old enough for eucalyptus leaves).According toNational Geographic, scientists have treated chlamydia with antibiotics in the past, but those antibiotics may have an adverse effect on koalas’ ability to break down harmful tannins in eucalyptus leaves. Now, there’s a preventive measure on the horizon: a vaccine. As NBC Newsreports, researchers at Australia’s University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) have administered an experimental chlamydia vaccine to more than 200 koalas, both captive and wild, and seen promising results. “The vaccine has now passed Phase 1 and Phase 2 testing that has established that it is completely safe and produces a good immune response and a good level of protection,” USC microbiology professor Peter Timms said in anews release. The team recently kicked off the third phase, which involves inoculating another 400 koalas at the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital. All koalas will also be implanted with microchips, so researchers can track any that end up back in the hospital in the next year. Chlamydia can cause pink eye, bladder infections, infertility, and evendeathin koalas. That’s bad news for any species, but especially one whose overall population has plummeted 30 percent since just 2018, according to the Australian Koala Foundation [PDF]. Major culprits include wildfires, drought, heat waves, and land clearing.

As9to5Mac reports, Apple is launchingSelf Service Repair—a new program that, as the name suggests, will let users order parts and repair their Apple devices themselves. When the roll-out begins in the U.S. early next year, its scope will be limited to screen, battery, and camera repairs on iPhones 12 and 13. Over the course of 2022, more countries, parts, and devices (starting with Mac computers that have M1 chips) will be added. Basically, once you’ve figured out what’s wrong with your device, you’ll order whatever you need to fix it from some 200 parts and tools available at the as-yet-unveiled Apple Self Service Repair Online Store. Though there’s no price range attached to anything yet, the general idea is that paying for parts will be cheaper than paying someone else to buy the parts and make the repair. You’ll also earn store credit if you give your broken parts to Apple to recycle. The new program could help the environment in another way, too. In September of this year, eco-focused mutual fund Green Century submitted ashareholder proposalurging Apple to lessen its restrictions on product repair in order to decrease electronic waste. “Electronic waste is the world’s fastest growing waste stream, and by 2040 internet-connected devices will account for 14 [percent] of all greenhouse gas emissions. Access to product repair is critical for extending the lifespan of electronic devices, thereby preventing wasted resources and reducing emissions,” the proposal explained. In other words, if it's easier for people to fix their Apple devices, they won’t be so quick to just get new ones. Green Century isn’t the only entity to have spoken out in support of consumers’ right to repair. In July of this year, President Joe Biden signed anexecutive orderthat encouraged the Federal Trade Commission “to issue rules against anticompetitive restrictions on using independent repair shops or doing DIY repairs of your own devices and equipment” in order to bolster the economy. Later that same month, the FTC released a statement [PDF] promising to crack down on “unlawful repair restrictions.” Applespokesperson Nick Leahytold The Vergethat the Self Service Repair program “has been in development for well over a year,” so neither Green Century’s proposal (which it withdrew once Apple announced the program) nor the federal messages directly prompted its creation.

It consists of spot-on impersonations of other birds he's heard around the forest, including the kookaburra. (The lyrebird's kookaburra impression is so convincing that he manages to get a response from the real thing.) Eventually, he moves on from imitating his feathered neighbors to recreating sounds produced by people. His impressions include a camera shudder, a camera with a motor drive, and a car alarm.

Though it isn’t the most well-known national park destination, it still sees more than 2 million visitors each year. Here are some interesting facts about Cuyahoga Valley National Park to know before you go. Cuyahoga is dedicated to maintaining the region’snatural biodiversity. The vegetation is primarily in the mixed mesophytic forest category, which means there’s a medium level of moisture in the area. It’s possible to find plants like bloodroot, goldenrod, wildflowers, shrubs, and plenty more within park lines. Because some of Cuyahoga Valley National Park has been developed to include public and private businesses, many of the local forests are smaller and more dispersed than they used to be. It’s generally believed the wordCuyahogais derived from the Mohawk wordCayagaga, which means “crooked river.” This name alludes to the structure of the Cuyahoga Valley. The Cuyahoga River splits Cleveland into two sections. Both branches of the river make up a canal that stretches 80 miles throughout the state between Akron and Cleveland, where much of Cuyahoga Valley National Park is. TheSeneca Nationrefer to the river asCuyohaga, which is believed to mean “place of the jawbone.” Unlike most national parks, Cuyahoga doesn't charge anentrance fee, though some park event activities may incur a cost. To help support the area, park officials recommend donating to the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park, if you’re able to do so.The organizationis dedicated to preserving, maintaining, and supporting Cuyahoga, making it an important part of the park’s infrastructure. Cuyahoga is one of the U.S.’s newer national parks. It wasdesignated in 1974as the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. Members of the National Park Service resisted its initial designation, as turning Cuyahoga into a national park would divert resources from many of the country's more well-known parks like Yosemite and Zion. But locals rallied to the cause, and the push to designate Cuyahoga was a success. Cuyahoga's value as a place for leisure goes back decades before it gained its official national park status. In 1929, accomplished businessman Hayward Kendalloffered the park430 acres of land and lasting financial support. He wanted to use the land specifically for park activities, and he championed the name “Virginia Kendall Park,” which was inspired by his mother. Today, you’ll find a lot of the park’s buildings in this particular area. It’s possible to visit a lodge, several picnic shelters, entertainment venues, camps, and even golf courses in this section of Cuyahoga. Cuyahoga Valley National Park is currently one of the nation’ssmaller national parks. It contains 32,950 acres of land. Comparatively,Zion National Parkcontains 148,016 acres;Yosemite National Park750,000 acres;Rocky Mountain National Park249,126 acres; andYellowstonean astonishing 2,221,766 acres. In 2020, Cuyahoga Valley National Park saw 2,755,628 visitors, making it the seventhmost-visited national parkin the U.S. The six national parks that surpassed Cuyahoga’s visitation numbers are Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Yellowstone, Zion, Rocky Mountain,Grand Teton, and theGrand Canyon. While Cuyahoga is used for a variety of different recreational opportunities, hiking is one of the more popular activities within the park, which features over125 milesof trails. The park doesn’t have any established campsites and it is not permitted to car camp within its boundaries, but there are a number of nearby camping options. Though the area was known for its air and riverpollution, efforts have been in place to clean the river—an important ecological resource—sincethe early 1900s. As of 2021, the Cuyahoga Riverwas removedfrom the lists of environmental areas of concern. It serves as a reminder that diligence and conscientious effort can help foster renewal and ecological health. Efforts to restore Cuyahoga’s natural wetlands are still in place. Although most people don’t think of Ohio when they imagine a place that’s full of reptiles, Cuyahoga Valley National Park has a fair number of them. In fact,20 different reptile specieshave been located within the park, including 11 different snake species, eight different turtle species, and even a skink. While no venomous snakes have been spotted within the park to date, it’s possible that the northern copperhead and the eastern massasauga may make their homes in this region."

Each new landowner would technically earn the title of “Lord” or “Lady” (or “Laird,” the traditional name for a Scottish landowner), and they’d also get the satisfaction of knowing they helped protect part of the Scottish Highlands. Peter and Laura christened their organization “Highland Titles” and soon bought another tract of land to add to their operation. Over the past 15 years,Highland Titleshas established fivenature reservesacross Scotland and another one in Northern Ireland. And as the New Zealand website,Stuff, points out, a Highland Title makes a lovely gift for the aspiring lord or lady in your life (or just anyone who appreciates an unconventional, eco-friendly gift). It’s surprisingly affordable. For $45, you can purchase a single square foot of land in Scotland’s Glencoe Wood, which also comes with a downloadable certificate bearing the name of the recipient as “Lord, Laird, or Lady of Glencoe.” If you’re looking for something slightly more romantic, you can shell out an extra $30 ($75 in total) for two square-foot plots located right beside each other. There arelarger plotsavailable, too: $113 will buy you 10 square feet of Glencoe, and 100 square feet costs $225. Plot owners can visit their land whenever they want; and there’s even a Highland Titles web app that you can use to view your tract and explore the reserves from afar [PDF].

64,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/651051/ice-age-facts-the-list-show,,"From what causes ice ages and how many we’ve had, to the species that thrived and the ones that died, here’s what you need to know about the ice age, adapted from an episode of The List Show on YouTube. The Utah Geological Surveydefines an ice ageas “a long interval of time … when global temperatures are relatively cold and large areas of the Earth are covered by continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers.” Basically, a weirdly cold winter or five wouldn’t be an ice age, but millions of years of chilly temperatures with ice sheets and glaciers would. For thousands of years, there were barely any earthworms across a large swath of North America. The animalsall but vanishedfrom the northern part of the continent around 10,000 years ago, and it wasn’t because they were gobbled up by some sort of prehistoric early bird:Glacierscaused their demise. During Earth’s most recent glaciation period, which peaked around 20,000 years ago, glaciers crept across the northern latitudes, grinding and scouring everything in their path. Soft, squishy earthworms were no match for the heavy ice. For thousands of years, much of the continent’s soil was without earthworms—that is, until European colonistsinadvertently introducedhordes of thecreepy crawliesto the landscape. Over its 4.5-billion year history, Earth has swung between periods of extreme heat and extreme cold. Crocodile-like reptiles once lurked within the lakes of the North Pole and palm trees swayed in Antarctic breezes. There are anumber of factorsthat might help plunge the planet into an ice age, and some explanations aren’t particularly intuitive. You probably know that increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere can warm the planet, but they might also have the opposite effect, given the right set of conditions. Around 460 million years ago, the volcanic eruptions that helped create parts of the northernAppalachian Mountainsdumped record-breaking amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. It’s believed that all that carbon created acid rain. As geochemist Lee Kump explained to the Earth science publicationEOS, when acid rain “‘attacks silicate rocks like granites and basalts,’ a chemical reaction incorporates the CO2 into limestone, which removes the molecule from the atmosphere.” More carbon in rocks and ocean floor sediment and less in the atmosphere might have contributed to the Earth’s cooling. That volcano example is a somewhat speedier version of what’s sometimes called theslow carbon cycle, in which carbon moves between rocks, soil, the ocean, and the atmosphere over hundreds of millions of years. Because rocks can sequester carbon—remove it from the atmosphere and store it in a form that doesn’t contribute to the greenhouse effect—scientists are interested in what factors might slow down or accelerate the weathering processes that break down rocks and lead to this sequestration. The formation of large mountain ranges, like the Himalayas, is oftenat the centerof these investigations. Some believe that the formation of these mountains causes increased weathering, which could then allow more carbon from the air to get stored in rocks [PDF]. Newer research complicates this picture—it may be that mountain formation doesn’t lead to anincreasein weathering overall, but instead exposes rocky material that’s morereactive, and therefore more efficient atweathering rocksand sequestering carbon. Anything that exposes new rocky material would therefore lead to increased carbon sequestration. This is an area of intense interest for geologists and other climate scientists. At minimum, the slow carbon cycle could give us insights into how the planet regulates its temperature. More ambitiously, some believe that human beings could eventually harness certain rocks’ carbon sequestering powers to helpcombat climate change. The planet’sorbit and the tilt of its axisaren’t as constant as you might think, and variations in them can contribute to ice ages.These changes happen regularlyover the course of hundreds of thousands of years, affecting the amount of sunlight that different latitudes on Earth receive, and by extension, the planet’s temperature. When the angle of Earth’s tilt decreases, summers cool down, allowing snow to accumulate. As layers of snow condense into glaciers and ice sheets, they reflect more sunlight—and therefore heat—causing global temperatures to drop. Each of the major ice ages themselves went throughcycles of freezing and thawing, called glacial and interglacial periods. During an interglacial period, glaciers recede toward the poles but don’t completely disappear. This ebb and flow of ice and heat is a long process that plays out over a span of tens of thousands of years, so you can probably cross off an instant planetary freeze, à la 2004’sThe Day After Tomorrow, from your list of climate concerns. The first of Earth’sfive major ice ageswas theHuronian glaciation, which kicked off about 2 billion years ago, possibly helped by a 250-million year pause in volcanic activity. That ice age was so intense that the entire planet froze over to form the first of a few “snowball Earths.” (Though many geologists think “slushball earth” would be a more accurate label, as the planet may not have been entirely frozen.) It’s believed land plants caused the Karoo, or Late Paleozoic, ice age, which started around 360 million years ago. As plants covered the planet, they sucked carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and released oxygen into the air, which caused temperatures to once again plummet. When people talk abouttheice age, they aren’t talking about any random glaciation period. They’re referring to themost recent glaciationduring the Pleistocene epoch of the Quaternary period. (An epochis a timeframe within a period; a period is a longer timeframe within an era.) So when we refer totheice age, going forward, we’re talking about a specific timeframe that lasted from about120,000 to 11,500 years ago. It’s believed tectonics played a big role in triggering the Quaternary Glaciation—more specifically, the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, the strip of land that links North and South America. The land bridge divides the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. When it formed, itdrastically changed both oceans’ currents, as the warm, tropical water could no longer flow between them. The warmer water went north,causing more precipitationin the Northern Hemisphere’s high latitudes. This precipitation—which, at high latitudes, fell as snow—kept piling up and freezingto form glaciersand ice sheets. All that ice reflected more light and absorbed less heat than the darker oceans it now covered, creatinga positive feedback cyclethat further decreased the planet’s temperature. The ice age reached its height, a period called the Last Glacial Maximum, around 20,000 years ago.Back then, 8 percent of the Earth’s surface, and a quarter of the planet’s total land area, was buried beneath ice.Ice sheetsup toa mile thickcovered North America—including a whopping97 percent of Canada—as well as large parts of Northern Europe, Asia, and Patagonia. Other parts of Northern Europe were basically transformed into a tundra, wiping out the warm-weather plants that had previously thrived there. Steppes, which are flat, unforested grasslands, expanded across the planet and sub-Saharan Africa became more arid. Because of all the water locked in frozen ice sheets at the time, the sea level was 400 feet lower than it currently is. During the Last Glacial Maximum, on average, the planet’s temperature hovered around46°F. That’s 11 degrees colder than the 20th century’s average global temperature. And average Arctic temperatures back then were25 degrees coolerthan today’s. Despite the cooler temperatures, wildlife thrived. Animalswe still see today, like shrews, mice, and lemmings, survived despite the changing landscape. Megafauna reigned supreme during the ice age. We don’t know for sure why prehistoric animals were so big.One theorysays that bigger prey animals were less likely to be hunted. Another theory, which followsa contested principleknown as Bergmann’s Rule, suggests that larger animals are more likely to be found in colder climates and higher latitudes. Whatever the cause, there were some big animals walking around in those cold climes. Woolly mammoths stood up to 11 feet tall at the shoulder. Thelargest saber-tooth cats, commonly (though incorrectly) called saber-toothtigers, reachednearly 1000 pounds—more than double the size ofmodern tigers. Bear-sized beavers roamed North America, and 12-foot-tall giant ground sloths burrowed around South America. There was also the Irish elk, one of the largest deer species ever recorded. They stood 7 feet tall at the shoulder and had antlers that spanned up to 12 feet—that’sdouble the sizeof amoose’s antlers. A lot of the iconic ice age megafauna went extinct after the ice age ended. There aremultiple theoriesas to why. One suggests that when the last glacial period ended and the climate shifted, it caused the vegetation that certain animals depended on to change. This was bad news for the large herbivores—and bad news for the large carnivores that depended on them. Another theory suggests an intense cold snap was the cause.One far-out ideaclaims meteorites or comets slammed into Earth, shifted the climate, and annihilated various species. And of course, there’s a popular theory that says a particularly powerful species of hunter was responsible for these mass extinctions:humans. Humans thrived during the ice age.ModernHomo sapiensevolvedaround 300,000 years ago. It was during the last glaciation period thatHomo sapiensbegan leaving Africa and spreading across the globe. Anatomically modern humans were already in Europe,mixing with Neanderthalsand creatingdetailed cave art, tens of thousands of years before the ice age hit its peak. It’s believed that our unusuallybig brains—and the tools and weaponsHomo sapienshad spent millennia advancing—allowed people to survive and continue expanding their range during the harsh conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum. The last ofthe other human speciesscattered around the world went extinct during the ice age. Thelatest known evidenceofHomo erectusdates to between 117,000 and 108,000 years ago. Neanderthals disappeared roughly 30,000 years ago, and some think the cooling climate in the years before the Last Glacial Maximum may be to blame. Though the Neanderthals had spent hundreds of thousands of years adapting to Europe’s chillier climate, the changing landscape may not have suited their hunting styles. ​​ The last glacial period ended over 10,000 years ago. Earth’s orbit changed, and the planet’s angle of tilt increased, leaving the Northern Hemisphere exposed to longer, more intense summers. Ice melted and the sea level rose. All that exposed water absorbed rather than reflected light, causing the planet’s temperatures to increase. You can still see traces of the ice age today. Head to Southern California’s La Brea Tar Pits, where you’ll find a bubbling, tarry sludge full of ice age animal bones,including dire wolvesand saber-tooth cats. Or visit Kerry, Ireland, where there’s a single lake that’s home to the only population of the Killarney shad,a type of fishwhose ancestors split their time between the ocean and freshwater but who became trapped in an Irish lake after ice sheets altered the landscape. On Canada’s Calvert Island, you’ll findhuman footprints from 13,000 years ago, left behind by the people who migrated to North America during the ice age. When ice sheets moved across the land, they left deep scars in their wake. Melting glaciers then filled those holes, creating famous bodies of water like theGreat Lakes and Scotland’s Loch Ness.Norway’s famous fjordsare valleys carved by glaciers, which later filled with sea water. But you don’t have to travel to some far-flung location to find hints of the ice age. If you’re ever hiking in the woods and find a large, scratched up rock, you’re likely looking at glacial striations caused by debris being dragged against the rock by an unrelenting chunk of ice. Or, if you’ve ever seen a massive boulder seemingly dropped out of nowhere, it’s most likely aglacial erratic, which is basically just a rock left behind by a moving glacier. Theice age ended a long time ago, but we’re actuallystill inanice age: theHolocene interglacial periodof the Quaternary ice age. Large portions of the Northern Hemisphere are no longer covered by ice, but we do still have some glaciers and ice sheets. Despite rapidly increasing global temperatures, our glaciers and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are still hanging around—for now."
65,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/650698/joshua-tree-national-park-facts,,"Joshua Tree National Park has always had a glamorous cachet—it is, after all, just two hours away from Los Angeles, so it's no surprise the park has a fascinating history filled with Hollywood-style drama. Many people don’t realize Joshua Tree National Park is actually composed of two distinct deserts. The southern tip of the Mojave Desert makes up its western edge and the Colorado Desert covers its eastern and southern areas. These deserts have different elevations, and as a result, different ecosystems. The Colorado Desert’s gentle slopes receive more annual rainfall and are home to desert lavender, desert agave, and colorful ocotillo plants [PDF]. The Joshua trees for which the park is named are more prevalent in the higher elevations on the Mojave side. Thedensest growth of Joshua treesin the world is found on the 1500-foot Cima Dome. The western end of the park even ascends into the 4000-footSan Bernardino Mountains, home of quaking aspen, California juniper, and Douglas pine trees. Joshua Tree is one of the youngest national parks in the country—it received that designation in October 1994. Joshua Tree now encompasses 800,000 acres, an area roughly the same size as Rhode Island [PDF]. It’s also one of themost popular national parks, as it’s a mere two-hour drive from Los Angeles. Its popularity has been a mixed blessing: Joshua Tree has seen an average of3 million visitorsper year in the past few years, though its infrastructure was only built for 1 million annually. This leads to long waits at the entrance gates and crowded campgrounds. Much of the park isn't reachable by road, causing overrun trails in the easier-to-access areas. The Joshua tree is a member of theYucca genus, a genus of usually stemless succulents. They can grow up to70 feet tall, though they can take up to half a century to reach their full size. The Joshua trees live for around 150 years, and it takes decades before their distinctive branches even begin to form. Because they store moisture in their roots, Joshua trees are referred to as the “great canteen of the desert.” Squirrels and jackrabbits find water by chewing on the trees during extreme drought, which in turn allows hawks and coyotes to find food. The shrub is only native to northwest Mexico and the American Southwest. Though there are still nearly a million currently growing throughout the Mojave Desert, like many other species, climate change has limited their range. By the end of the century, environmentalists predict80 percentof Joshua trees will be wiped out. The Cahuilla people call Joshua treeshumwichawa. Traditionally, they used the hardy plant’s leaves and seeds for baskets, sandals, and food, and even carved out its branches for use as containers. When Mormon settlers first arrived in the area in the 19th century,legend has itthat the distinctive trees reminded them of the Old Testament story of Joshua, the leader of the Israelites who held his arms up to heaven in a prayer to God to lead them across Canaan, hence the plant’s current name. Mormons may have given the national park its current moniker, but people are believed to have lived in the area for thousands of years. Therocky landscapeprovided shelter, as well as springs and vegetation for food. The park still contains artifacts from the Mojave, Serrano, Chemeheuvi, and Cahuilla tribes—including petroglyphs carved into many of the rock formations. By the 1800s, cattlemen, miners, and homesteadershad begun to appearon the land. The park is known for its heat: The average high in the summer months is a roasting100° F. But like many deserts, it can become quite cold as well, and snow in the higher elevations is not unheard of. Temperatures have dropped below freezing in the winter—once reaching arecord low of 10° Fin 1990 —and the park gets a dusting of snow about every year. It’s actually too cold for most cacti to grow there. In February 2021, the park saw a snowfall like it hadn’t seen inover a decade. The snow reached not only the usual higher elevations, but also the valley floor. The Joshua trees apparently love precipitation in any form, but the snow and ice typically disappear as quickly as they arrive. The black and white panoramic photograph on the sleeve of U2’s blockbuster 1987 albumThe Joshua Treewasn't shot in the national park, though the image on the inside cover is in fact of one of the trees. The famous cover was actually shot 200 miles away in Darwin, California. Ona bus triparound the Mojave Desert during the first day of shooting, lead singer Bono learned of the biblical origin of the nameJoshua treeand decided to make it the title of the band’s album. The next day, the cover photo was taken in under half an hour by the now-famous lone Joshua tree in Darwin. In 2011, a Dutch music venue manager died in Joshua Tree National Park;some believedhe was searching for the spot used in U2’s album cover, after he told colleagues he wanted to visit it. Joshua Tree National Park has a long history of inspiring artists, especially musicians. The Eagles’ self-titled 1972 debut album features a scenic sunset at the park. The photoshoot occurred during an overnight camping trip with the band and photographer Henry Diltz. As Don Henleyrecallsin the documentaryThe History of the Eagles, Part One, “We had a bag of peyote buttons, a bunch of trail mix, some tequila, a bunch of water, and some blankets. And the seven of us set out for Joshua Tree.” In the decades since, the park has continued to feature widely in music, voted byUSA Todayas one of thetop musical attractionsin the world in 2015. Joshua Tree National Park also serves as a backdrop in the music videos for Selena’s “Amor Prohibido,” Missy Elliott’s “Lose Control,” Ariana Grande’s “Into You,” and Walk the Moon’s “One Foot.” One of the park’s more bizarre music connections surrounds the funeral of country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons. Parsons was briefly a member of the Byrds, introduced the Rolling Stones to country music, and discovered Emmylou Harris. He visited the park in September 1973 and died of an overdose in the nearby Joshua Tree Inn on September 19. During the trip, his road manager, Phil Kaufman, claimed Parsonsspoke of his desireto be cremated upon his death and have his ashes scattered in Joshua Tree. To fulfill the musician’s final wishes, Kaufman and his friend posed as mortuary workers to intercept Parsons’s body at the airport, stopped at a gas station for gasoline canisters, and drove to Joshua Tree National Park’s Cap Rock formation, where they doused the body in gasoline and set it on fire before being caught. Therewas no lawagainst stealing a corpse, so instead the two men were only charged with misdemeanor theft for stealing the coffin, and were forced to pay several small fines. The motel where Parsons died is still in operation and his roomremains its most popular. Makeshift memorials pop up on Cap Rock, but Joshua Tree doesn't officially recognize Parsons's link to the park. Area 51 isn't the only desert locale with an extraterrestrial reputation. Joshua Tree National Park has also been dubbed a UFO hotspot. Ufologist Dr. Steven Greer hosts “Contact in the Desert,” the world’s largest UFO conference, for three days every June in the park. The conference presents on alleged archaeological evidence of aliens and how to contact extraterrestrial life. UFO enthusiasts can even stay in aFuturo housewithin the park."
66,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/651182/great-chicago-fire-1871-history-facts,,"On October 8, 1871, Chicago was transformed into a hellish inferno. For two days the city burned as firefighters struggled to get control of the blaze. By the time a sudden rain helped extinguish the flames, 300 people were dead, 100,000 more were homeless, and $200 million in damage—the equivalent of nearly $4.5 billion today—had been done. Like a phoenix, Chicago rose from the ashes. A century and a half later, the city glows like an ember along the blue shores of Lake Michigan, a testament to the resilience of the city’s people. To help you separate fact from fiction, here are some facts you may not have known about the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. While it is widely believed that the fire began whenMrs. O’Leary’s cow knocked over a lantern, it is likely that the myth ofMrs. O’Leary’s culpabilityresulted from a mix of xenophobia, misogyny, anti-Catholic sentiment, and classism. Joseph Medill, who co-owned theChicago Tribuneat the time, often wrote anti-Irish screeds in the paper. Another reporter from the time, Joseph Edgar Chamberlain of theChicago Evening Post,was blunt in his assessmentthat “that neighborhood” where the fire began “had always been a terra incognita to respectable Chicagoans.” The truth is no one is sure how the fire began, and Mrs. O’Leary and her cow wereofficially exoneratedin 1997. Known asfire whirlsorconvection whirls, the scorching hot air—upon coming into contact with cooler air—began spinning “like a hurricane, howling like myriads of evil spirits,”according to one eyewitness. These flames could form walls of fire that reached up to 100 feet into the air, turning the city into a proverbial hell on earth. At the same time as Chicago burned,the Peshtigo Fire was raging in Wisconsin, directly to the north along the shores of Lake Michigan. Born of the same conditions as the Chicago fire, the Peshtigo Fire was far larger, leaving a path of destruction that was 10 miles wide and 40 miles long. It was also more deadly; approximately 1500 people lost their lives in the Peshtigo Fire. While we think of cities as places of concrete and steel, in the 19th century, most of Chicago’s buildings were made of timber logged in the forests of Wisconsin. Even its roads and sidewalks were built using planks, which became deadly infernos making escape difficult. William Ogden, who served as Chicago’s first mayor from 1837 to 1838, was also largely responsible for developing the timber industry in the region at the time.According to the Peshtigo Fire Museum, Ogden “established a barge line between Peshtigo Harbor and Chicago” before developing railroad lines to better transport his lumber. Ogden, who also owned a lumber company in Peshtigo, lost the bulk of his personal possessions and most of his business holdings between the two fires. It is popularly thought that the fire led Chicago to become a world leader in skyscrapers, but the truth is it took another decade for the skyscraper boom to begin. That doesn’t mean working class Chicagoans were spared the pitfalls of gentrification, though. As Jerry Larson, a professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Cincinnatitold WTTW, “most of the buildings were rebuilt almost exactly as they looked before the fire.” Building with materials other than wood was cost-prohibitive, meaning working-class Chicagoans who couldn't afford more fire-resistant materials were forced out of Chicago's downtown area. In the popular imagination, Chicago was left in ruins, but the truth is a little less sensational. While most of Chicago's downtown area—the city's central business district—was destroyed, much of the city’s West Side remained unscathed. Crucially, the stockyards on the South Side, most of the city’s railroads, and the wharfs, mills, and lumberyards along the Chicago Riverremained untouched by the flames, allowing the city and its economy to rapidly recover and continue as the “hog butcher of the world.” Few people realize just how dry Chicago was during the summer and autumn of 1871. According toWGN meteorologist Tom Skilling, “the last significant rain event before the fire was 1.57 inches on July 3,” and the period from the Fourth of July through to the day of the fire remains the driest period in Chicago's history. Given rising global temperatures and an increasing number of droughts leading to wildfires, the circumstances that led to the Great Chicago Firemay offer lessons for our changing climate. More than 60 years after the fire, a film about the inferno would take Oscar gold.In Old Chicago, which was released in 1938, presents a fictionalized version of the events leading up to the blaze. The film follows the exploits of Dion O’Leary, the son of Mrs. O’Leary, played by Tyrone Power. Though the film took great historical liberties by inventing and renaming characters, it went on to earn six Academy Award nominations, with Alice Brady winning Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal as Mrs. O’Leary."

Once customers have squeezed their preferred sauce over their food, they're encouraged to save the used packets in a cardboard box instead of tossing them in the trash. As the container starts filling up, they can create an account with TerraCycle and print a free shipping label to stick to the box. The customer then ships the package via UPS, and TerraCycle handles converting the plastic into raw materials for reuse. The project is Taco Bell's attempt to make its packaging practices a little gentler on the environment. Originally, the company wanted to set up packet collection boxes in stores, but with the majority of its meals now being ordered for takeout or delivery, giving customers the option to mail their recyclables makes more sense. The program may not be worth it for the occasional Taco Bell patron, but it could be appealing to anyone with a drawer full of fire hot sauce packets at home. You can learn more about the initiative and sign up to take parthere. Hopefully this effort is more successful thanthese discontinued menu itemsfrom Taco Bell's history. [h/tNPR]"

Atotalof 22 animals (and one plant)—including the Bachman’s warbler songbird and 10 other birds, two freshwater fish, 11 mussels, and one bat—are scheduled to be removed from the endangered species list owing to their suspected or confirmed disappearance. This is a move that comes often as a result of humans altering their natural habitats via farming, damming, or logging. Eleven of the species hail from Hawaii and Guam, where non-native species like pigs and deer have decimated populations. Climate change is also playing a large role. Birds, for example, may be exposed to avian malaria from mosquitoes because warmer temperatures at higher elevations have put them at risk. Most all of them were considered extinct prior to the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973. While it means they likely couldn’t benefit from conservation, the announcement serves as a stark warning about the importance of future efforts. If confirmed, the 23 listings will join 11 species that have been declared extinct since the Act was first passed. (Fifty-four species have been removed from the Endangered Species list due to their recovery in that same timeframe, while another 56 moved from endangered to threatened.) To be declared extinct, a species has typically gone decades without a confirmed sighting. The ivory-billed woodpecker, for example, was last seen in the 1940s, though unconfirmed reports have persisted into the 21st century. The woodpecker, the largest known in the United States, saw its numbers dwindle as logging companies razed areas where it was known to be found. Here's the complete list: Birds:Bachman’s warbler, Ivory-billed woodpecker, Bridled white-eye, Kauai akialoa, Kauai nukupuu, Kauaʻi ʻōʻō, Large Kauai thrush, Maui ākepa, Maui nukupuʻu, Molokai creeper, Po`ouli Mussels:Flat pigtoe mussel, Green-blossom pearly mussel, Southern acornshell mussel, Stirrupshell mussel, Tubercled-blossom pearly mussel, Turgid-blossom pearly mussel, Upland combshell mussel, Yellow-blossom pearly mussel Fish:San Marcos gambusia, Scioto madtom Bat:Little Mariana fruit bat Plant:Phyllostegia glabra var. lanaiensis Not all experts agree with every entry on the proposal, with some saying it might be premature to remove the woodpecker from the list. The Fish and Wildlife Service will take public input and comments on the announcement through December. [h/tCNN]"

But it wasn’t going well, largely due toclimate change. Wildfires, drought, and heat waves rocked the Pacific Northwest, which devastated some of the region’sChristmas treefarms. “The second day of the heat, it was 116[°F]. I came in the driveway that night and seen the trees were basically cooking. Burnt down to nothing,” Jacob Hemphill, owner of Hemphill Tree Farm in Oregon City, Oregon,toldReutersin July. Most of his losses were seedlings, but some mature trees gotknocked out, too. That same month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released a report [PDF] showing that Christmas tree acreage in Oregon—which generates more Christmas trees than any other state—decreased by 24 percent between 2015 and 2020. For Elizabeth Werkmeister Shafer, owner of Werkmeister Christmas Tree Farm in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, one of the main setbacks this season was pests. She predicted that these widespread agricultural complications coupled with already high demand will create a shortage—and an early one. “If you don't have a tree by Thanksgiving weekend, it'll be hard to find a fresh-cut tree,” shetold WHAS11. Unfortunately, it may be harder than usual to find an artificial one this year, too. Supply chain disruptions have made countless everyday products scarce, fromcarsandtoilet papertoketchup packets. ArtificialChristmas treeshaven’t escaped unscathed. If you’re waiting for some nationalChristmastree organization to weigh in on the matter before you make your tree purchasing plans, the American Christmas Tree Association already has. “The supply of real Christmas trees will be impacted by the extreme weather conditions—fires, drought, heat—that hammered growers this season. Artificial tree supplies are being impacted by the serious supply chain issues that are plaguing just about every product that is imported into the U.S.,” it told WHAS11. In short, whether you’re planning to buy a fake fir or thereal McCoy, you should probably do it much earlier than you typically would. [h/tWHAS11]"

After all, sharing an enclosed space with rotting food scraps doesn't sound like the ideal way to enjoy life. But small-scale, indoor composting is definitely possible, and you won't even have to fill your home with any unpleasant odors to get it done. If you're just looking to dip your toe in the water and do your part tocut down on food wastearound the country, this 4.7-star-ratedVremi Agent of Change Kitchen Compost Bincan help you get started. This $30 bin is attractive enough to keep out on your countertop, but it's also small enough to fit under a sink to hide away. Made of durable, rust-resistant stainless steel, the bin is about 11 inches tall, 6.5 inches wide, and can be filled with about 1.2 gallons of liquid, making it large enough to fit about a week's worth of compostable kitchen waste. Two key issues most people have with composting—odor and potentially attracting bugs and insects—are combated via the activated charcoal filter, which fits on the bin's vented lid. The filter traps odors and can be hand-washed and reused for up to six months. Customers praised the bin's ability to keep odors out, with one saying, ""[the] lid forms a tight seal and has several layers of filters to stop the odors from escaping."" The bucket and lid are also safe to use in a dishwasher. According to theEPA, composting at home requires three basic ingredients: “browns,” “greens,” and water. Browns are dry carbon-rich materials like dead leaves, branches, twigs, egg cartons, and paper that's generally unprocessed. Greens are generally wet, nitrogen-rich materials like food scraps, flowers, grass clippings, coffee grounds, and eggshells. A compost pile should have an equal amount of browns and greens, with enough water to provide moisture to break down organic matter. After two to five weeks, your compost should be readyfor use inyour garden or indoor plant soil. And if you don't have plants in the home, you can alwaysdonate your compostto a local community garden or have it picked up by yourmunicipality.

Ragweed pollen in particular is known to wreak havoc during autumn. Whatever the season, a crucial way to avoid the worst of allergies is to keep your house as pollen-free as possible. Here are five tips for doing that, courtesy ofForbes’s Houzzblog. Though “airing out” your house sounds nice,sneeze-inducing particles are sure to hitch a ride on that lovely outdoor breeze. Keeping your windows (and doors) shut is a safer bet. Being extra diligent aboutvacuumingduring allergy season is a great idea, but all your hard work will be rendered moot if a cloud of allergens reenters the air when you transfer the waste to your kitchen trash can. Walk your vacuum outside and empty it into a bag there. Taking your shoes off at the door so you don’t track in pollen is a given, and changing outfits as soon as you get inside is worth the extra effort. If you were wearing something that exposed a lot of skin, taking a quick shower to rinse off wouldn’t hurt, either. Even if you don’t hop in theshowerright away, you probably should before you lay your pollen-y head on your pillow for the night. If you’re against washing your hair so often, Houzz’s Becky Harris recommends covering your hair with a scarf or a bandana before heading outside. While bathing yourdogorcatevery time they enter the house almost definitely isn’t feasible, wiping down their paws should be. A quick full-body brush can help remove some pollen from their fur, too.

Sometimes the convenience of a disposablecoffeecup outweighs any guilt you feel about throwing it away after one use. But when it comes to adopting more sustainable habits, you don't have to take an all-or-nothing approach. Making one simple change to your morning to-go order lets you have your coffee and drink it, too. According toHuffPost, requesting your drink without a lid is a great way to cut down on plastic waste. Whether you take your beverage hot or cold, the disposable cup almost always comes with a plastic lid. Not all plastic coffee containers are recyclable, and that material can takedecadesto break down in a landfill. By drinking your coffee without a lid, you're reducing the amount of single-use plastic that comes with your order. If your coffee is served in a paper cup with a biodegradable, plant-based lining, it's bested only by reusable mugs in terms of eco-friendless. A lidless coffee order doesn't make sense for every situation. If you want to keep your drink hot on a cold day or keep it from splashing you during your commute, tweaking your order for the sake of sustainability may not be worth it to you. But if you plan on taking your ""to-go"" cup as far as your favorite seat in Starbucks, skipping the lid is a no-brainer. Straws are another single-use part of your coffee cup that's often superfluous. Many coffee shops have started phasing out the items by introducingstrawless lidsfor cold beverages.

Viewing the aurora borealis in a 4K video isn't quite as impressive as seeing it in person, but it is much more convenient. This high-resolution footage reported byNerdistwas shot by marine biologist Alexander Semenov in May 2021. It shows colorful ribbons of light streaming over the White Sea in Russia. The video captures every part of the scene in clear detail, from the starry sky to the frozen water, making it easy to pretend you're really there. (If you were viewing thenorthern lightsin real life, however, they would sound more like bacon sizzling in a pan and less like a movie score.) The aurora borealis results from a reaction between the sun's rays and Earth's atmosphere. As charged solar particles fly toward our planet, they collide with gas molecules near the poles where the magnetic field is most concentrated. This ""excites"" atoms in the atmosphere, and as they revert to their original state, they release photons that light up the sky. Auroras come in a variety of colors, but vibrant greens as displayed in the video are most common. Russia's White Sea is out of the way for most people, but you don't necessarily have to fly halfway around the world to see this phenomenon.

But these frozen giants, which exist on every continent except Australia, are facing extinction. Thanks in part to global warming, roughly28 trillion tonsof ice has vanished since the mid-1990s, and 1.2 trillion tons now disappear each year. Here are a few “rivers of ice” from around the world retreating at a rapid rate. Africa’s tallest mountain, Kilimanjaro, rises 3.7 miles above sea level in Tanzania. Throughout the 19th century, tropical glaciers framed the mountain’s central cone, the Kibo caldera. But more recently, glaciers clinging to Kibo have endured loss of about90 percentof its mass due to sublimation, a process in which ice evaporates into vapor without melting first. Furtwängler, Kilimanjaro’s largest glacier, exists now as a thin ice wall. It shrank by nearly 70 percent between 2014 and 2020, and scientists estimateit will soon be gone. The Antarctic Ice Sheet contains7.2 million cubic milesof ice, and it’s drained by several “ice streams” leading to the ocean. Pine Island Glacier (PIG) and its neighbor Thwaites are among the largest and leakiest, serving as the main streams for ice to slip into the Amundsen Sea. This western pocket alone contains enough vulnerable ice to raise theglobal sea level by 4 feet. PIG alone loses roughly58 billion tonsof ice each year. The54,000 glaciersin the Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH), a region stretching across eight countries from Pakistan to central China, serve as a water source for10 major river basinsandaround 1.65 billionpeople. Glacier loss threatens these communities. From 1975 to 2000, HKH glaciers lost an average10 inches a year, and that rate doubled between 2000 and 2016. Siachen Glacier is thelongestin the Indian Himalayas and second longest in the world’s non-polar areas. Aletsch, the largest glacier in the Alps, has retreatednearly two miles since 1870. This ice river and more than 1500 others in Switzerland havelost 60 percentof their volume since 1850. Popular pastimes are also feeling the heat. A 2019 study in the journalArctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Researchreviewed the evolution of 95 regional mountaineering routes. Ninety-three had been “affected” by climate change, and of those, 26 were “greatly affected.” Three no longer exist at all. Mer de Glace is the largest glacier in France andsecond longest in the Alps. Nestled near the Alps’ highest summit, Mont Blanc, Mer de Glace offers visitors a view of glacier life quickly disappearing. It has shrunk by a third since the 1900s, with total loss of 1.5 cubic kilometers, or roughly “half a millionOlympic swimming pools” of ice, according to Bloomberg. In 1988, visitors could exit a cable car and take three steps to reach the ice. It required nearly120 steps in 2000, and is now approaching 600. Threatened flora and fauna include the génépi plant, which produces a drink similar to absinthe, and the rock ptarmigan. Montana’sGlacier National Parkwasonce home to 150 glaciers, which decreased to 80 by 1850. The park wascreated in 1910, and joined with Canada’s Waterton Lakes Provincial Park to form the world’s first International Peace Park straddling the two countries’ border in 1932. Glacier has 26 of its eponymous ice rivers left today, which are projected to disappear by 2030. Every named glacier shrank (some by 80 percent) between 1966 and 2015,accordingto the National Park Service.Blackfoot Glacieris the largest of those left at approximately .7 square miles. Glacier Bay, the centerpiece of Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, wascompletely filled with icein 1750, but the glaciers feeding it have withdrawn by more than 60 miles since. All told,99 percentof Alaska’s tidewater glaciers (which terminate in tidal inlets and bays) are in retreat. Many now terminate on land, shedding ice into the sea no more. Muir Glacier, one of the region’s most notable vanishing acts and former major attractions, used to deliver baby ‘bergs daily, but has receded over 30 miles since 1892. Muir flowed at about16 feet per dayuntil 1979; today it lumbers along at little more than six inches a day. Greenland holds the world’s “other” ice sheet: along with Antarctica’s, their ice sheets containmore than 99 percentof the freshwater ice on Earth. If the Greenland ice sheet melted entirely, global sea levels would rise 20 feet. Vast influxes of cold fresh water to the ocean could interfere with the Gulf Stream and Amazon rainforest. From 1979 to 2006, its loss of ice increased by 30 percent. Sermeq Kujalleq (Jakobshavn in Danish), Greenland’s largest glacier, isreceding nearly two milesinland annually. NASA’s Oceans Melting Greenland (yes, “OMG”) project will soon wrap up a six-year study to understand how warmer ocean waters and colder ice-sheet melt affect the movement of glaciers. Patagonia’s icefieldhas northern and southern lobes, and it’s also melting at one of the planet’s highest rates. The San Rafael Glacier, part of the northern segment, is the area’s only ocean-reaching outlet and theclosestocean-terminating glacier to the Equator. San Rafael begins on Monte San Valentin, the tallest Patagonian summit, and is one of themost actively calving glaciersin the world due to its fast flow (4.7 miles per year). It’s the speediest glacier in Patagonia and among the swiftest in the world. From 1870 to 2011, San Rafael’s area shrank by 11.5 percent. New Zealand has accessible glaciers in its Southern Alps, where retreat is easily observed by non-scientists. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research has found that a third of the permanent ice from the alpine range was lost from1977 to 2014. The tourist-friendly Fox and Franz Josef glaciers are taking a huge hit. Fox lost half a mile from2008 to 2018, and Franz Josef has been retreating even more rapidly, losing almost a mile in the same time frame—its fastest rateever recorded. The retreat threatens the livelihoods of New Zealand’s glacier guides, who struggle to find ways of ferrying tourists to the ice ever farther away. Puncak Jaya in Papua features the last of thetropical glaciersin the Western Pacific Warm Pool, an area that serves as a “heat engine” and climate regulator for the world. Glaciers here have receded and thinned. A 2021 study in the journalGlobal and Planetary Changerevealed Puncak Jayalost approximately 93 percentof its ice from 1980 to 2018. Models predict its shrinkage will continue, leading tototal ice lossthis decade. That would mean the end of the only tropical glacier between the Himalayas and the Andes. The Andes range is home to99 percent of the world’stropical glaciers, spanning seven countries, with 70 percent found in Peru. The Quelccaya glacier is that country’slargest ice capand the second-largest glaciated area in the tropics. Its surface area decreased by46 percentfrom 1976 to 2020, and it’s expected to disappear within the century, impacting the surrounding ecosystem, economy, and local communities. Another Andean casualty is the former Chacaltaya Glacier in Bolivia, which lefta ghost town and ski resortbehind by 2009, six years earlier than scientists in the 1990s had expected."

And now, researchers in the Czech Republic suggest that fish can show signs of addiction when exposed to methamphetamine in contaminated water. In a lab-based experiment, the researchers mimicked the surroundings of brown trout swimming in drug-polluted rivers. AsCNETreports, the fish were separated into two groups. The first group was kept for eight weeks in a tank with clean water, while the second group lived in a tank with a concentration of 1 microgram of meth per liter of water. After the eight weeks, the researchers moved all the fish into a tank with two streams of water: one clean, the other laced with meth. They found that the fish from the meth-laced tank suffered withdrawal-like symptoms for about four days and were sluggishly moving around the tank. About half of the meth-exposed fish were attracted to the meth-tainted stream, while only 41 percent of the drug-free fish went to the tainted stream. The researchers also discovered that the trout from the meth-containing tank had traces of the drug in their brains 10 days after their last exposure to the polluted water. The findings appeared in theJournal of Experimental Biology. The study aimed to examine how detrimental low-level drug pollution is to aquatic health. As Pavel Horký, the paper's lead author, said in apress release, the team is “concerned that drug addiction could drive fish to congregate near unhealthy water treatment discharges in search of a fix, as well as disturbing their natural tempo of life.” But since this study was conducted under lab conditions, more research is needed to know if brown trout in the wild would experience the same effects."

The plant, which often appears as a three-leafed shrub or vine, can prompt a rash thanks to urushiol, an irritating oil in its leaves. Shower within a half-hour of contact and you’ll be generally OK. But thanks to climate change, poison ivy may soon be getting more potent. Researchers have been keeping an eye on how poison ivy is reacting to a shifting environment. In 2006, Duke and Harvard University scientistspublisheda study in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciencesdemonstrating that poison ivy could double its usual size when there were increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. More CO2helpedthe plant with photosynthesis and water usage; CO2 also prompted it to produce more urushiol, meaning it could prove substantially more irritating to human skin. Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also what’sbringingon climate change, and this pumped-up version of poison ivy is one result. As carbon dioxide levels continue to increase, so could more irritating and pervasive poison ivy. The plant is also benefiting from warmer soils. In one experiment conducted at Harvard, an increase of 9°F in soil temperature resulted in poison ivy growing 149 percent faster, far exceeding the 10 percent to 20 percent seen in other plants under the same conditions. Coupled with the fact poison ivy likes to grow in human-cleared areas like camp sites, it’s likely the plant will become more of a concern in the years to come. If you’re communing with nature, try to wear pants and long sleeves rather than shorts and t-shirts, and learn to identify possible poison ivy.

80,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/647055/hyperion-worlds-tallest-tree,,"From the ground, the world’s tallest tree is easy to overlook: It has the same thick, craggy bark as the thousands of other coast redwoods towering over the temperate, fog-blanketed forests of Northern California, and it grows the same needle-like foliage. To truly understand what makes the tree exceptional, you would need to scale its trunk, as onebotanistdid in 2006. After lowering a measuring tape from the tallest leaf, you would learn that the tree—known as Hyperion—stands over380 feet. That makes it nearly 75 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty. But when hikers pass beneath Hyperion, they may have no idea that they’re standing in the shadow of the tallest living organism, and one of the most famous trees, on Earth. Hyperion isn't marked on any maps, and the Redwood State and National Parks keep its exact location in theRedwood Creek basinhidden from the public. That's because despite its formidable size, Hyperion is vulnerable. “When a globally superlative thing is discovered, people want to go see it,” Richard Campbell, director of restoration for the Save the Redwoods League, tells Mental Floss [PDF]. “And people want to go take photos of it, and put it on Instagram, and climb all over it, and carve their initials into it.” Foot traffic can trample the tree’s understory and compact the soil around the roots. Too many visitors could jeopardize the health of the 600-year-old behemoth. Historically, coast redwoods’ superlative nature has been one of the biggest threats to their survival. From the 1850s to the 1960s, more than90 percentof California’s original redwood trees were logged for their valuable timber. Hyperion escaped that era, but hiding its location may not be enough to get it through the next century. Just as the forests are beginning to recover, moreintense firesand other stressors aggravated by climate change threaten their progress. Now, conservationists are hoping they can use redwoods’ natural charisma to the species’ advantage. As the tallest trees in existence, coast redwoods have specific needs. In order to grow up totwo to three feetper year, they require constant hydration. So even in areas with high levels of rainfall, the trees rely on a back-up moisture source in case of dry spells—like thick fog generated by the ocean, which keeps redwood forests damp all year long. Only a few places on Earth meet these criteria. Today, the coast redwood’s natural range is limited to a450-mile-long, 5- to 35-mile-wide strip of coastline running through Northern California to Southern Oregon. Redwoods were once much more abundant in theregion. Their numbers began to decline starting in themid-19th century, when white settlers flooded the area hoping to profit off the California gold rush. New towns popped up practically overnight, and there was a sudden need for materials to construct buildings and furniture. The mighty redwoods covering the land became a primary lumber source. Loggers that felled the trees found wood that wasbeautiful and lightweight, yet stronger than its close relative, thegiant sequoia. The same qualities that allowed redwoods to grow so large and live so long—like decay-resistanttanninsand fire resistance from low resin—made their lumber highly desirable. Their size was another selling point. The trees often exceed 300 feet in height and grow18 feet wide, adding up to a lot of product. Coast redwoods are still considered to be one of themost valuablespecies in the lumber industry. And though Native American people on the coast builthomesand canoes from redwood planks prior to colonists’ arrival, they mainly harvested their material from fallen trees and encouraged new forest growth. The destruction that began in 1850 was unprecedented. From the beginning, redwood loggers faced opposition. California’s majestic giants were unlike anything growing out east, and conservationists were moved to protect them. TheSan Francisco Daily Chroniclesounded the alarm bell in 1854, writing, “Soon the whole neighborhood will be cleared of growing timber. Already the fairest and largest trees have fallen before fire, ax, and saw. Those magnificent pillars, which form so strange a crown to the mountains when seen from San Francisco and the bay, are slowly disappearing.” Passion for California’s redwoods—including the giant sequoia as well as the coast redwood—helped kick off a larger conservation movement in the U.S. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant Act in 1864, bestowing Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree Grove to the state of California and thus establishing the nation’s first state-controlled park. Sixteen years later, Sequoia National Park become the first national park in California and the second in the country. Such legislation was able to save only a minority of the state’s oldest redwoods. Improvements in logging technology in the early 20th century posed the greatest threat yet. Following World War II, California saw a housing boom, and the lumber industry raced to keep up with demand. Every year throughout the 1950s, redwoods were logged at three times the rate of any year prior to that decade. The decimation of the redwood forests wouldn’t start to decline until the mid-1970s, and by that point, the vast majority of the old-growth trees had already been felled. Conservationists have spent years working to recover the forests, but planting new trees isn’t a miracle solution. Trees that grow slowly over centuries are bigger, healthier, and capable ofstoring more carbon, making them essential components of the environment. “The old coast redwood forest has the ability to sequester and store more carbon than any place on land, pretty much,” Campbell says. “And the trees along the coast, especially up in Redwood State Park area, are sort of the epitome of that. They have the highest biomass of any forest. The most biomass of any tree.” Many of the old-growth redwoods that remain on the coast owe their survival to the expansion of Redwood National Park in 1978. That includesHyperion, which narrowly avoided destruction in the last century. After spending thesummer of 2006exploring a remote area of Redwood National Park, naturalists Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor stumbled upon a new candidate for world’s tallest tree [PDF], growing on a steep slope. Less thantwo monthsearlier, they had discovered Helios and Icarus, which measured 376 feet and 371 feet tall, respectively; both trees beat the previous record holder, Stratosphere Giant in Humboldt Redwoods State Park. This new coast redwood had the potential to best them all. After finding the tree—which they dubbed Hyperion after the Titan father of Helios in Greek mythology—they contacted botanist Steve Sillett of Humboldt State University in California. Sillett, considered the authority on coast redwoods, was the first scientist to climb the old-growth trees, beginning in 1987, and study the vibrant ecosystems in their canopies. Upon arriving at the tree, he helped the researchers measure it using a laser rangefinder. Initial calculations put it at 378 feet—which would have made it the tallest tree by a comfortable margin. But laser rangefinders aren’t always accurate. The tools uselaser pulsesto estimate the distances between the viewer and the top and base of the tree.Calculatingthe angles produced by the distances results in a decent estimate of the tree's height, but with measurements this important, Sillett wanted to be sure. He gathered his ropes andmechanical ascendersand started his climb. Dropping a fiberglass tape from the top of the tree showed that their estimates were low: Hyperion was 379.1 feet tall—three feet taller than the next tallest tree standing not far from there. (It’s grown more than a foot since 2006.) The find was also remarkable for another reason. Hyperion is located in the Redwood Creek basin, which only became protected land relatively recently. Lumber workers cleared wide swaths of the forest in the 1970s. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter made the basin government property with the Redwood National Park expansion act. The legislation came at a lucky time for Hyperion and its fellow giants in the area. From the tree, Sillett could see where loggers had clearcut part of the forest, and he estimated that Hyperion had probably been less than two weeks away from suffering the same fate. The superlative tree is also young, at least compared to other old-growth redwoods. Experts have placed its age between600 and 800 years; the oldest coast redwood is more than2500 years old. Speaking toThe New Yorkerin 2006, Sillett said Hyperion “could get to 390 feet in our lifetime.” To have a shot at another 600 years of survival, the tree needs protection. That’s why Redwood State and National Parks have never shared its location with the public. But that doesn’t mean its whereabouts are top-secret; there are guides givingunofficial toursthrough the remote area to the famous tree. The rigorous hike may prevent the site from ever becoming a full-blown tourist attraction, but as the climate crisis worsens, foot traffic may become the least of Hyperion's problems. Forest fires have always been part of the coast redwood’s ecology, but the new breed of fire fueled by climate change presents a unique threat. California saw an unprecedented wildfire season in 2020, and by mid-October,4.25 million acresof land had burned. That included 81,000 acres of coast redwoods, 11,000 of which were old-growth. The changing climate has intensified droughts and heat waves in California, and more dry brush and dead wood have accumulated on the forest floor as a result. This, combined with poor forest management, produces unusually powerful fires. Prior to the 19th century, Native Americans periodically lit controlled fires in the redwood forests to clear the underbrush and make room for new plants to grow. When white settlers arrived in the area, they stopped forest fires from spreading whenever possible and allowed plant debris to build up.Fire suppressionis considered a primary culprit behind the devastating forest fires of the modern era. Even with thick, fire-resistant bark, some coast redwoods aren’t able to survive such intense blazes. Trees that do survive may lose their crowns and take years to regrow them, disrupting entire ecosystems in the meantime. Beyond fires, climate change threatens themoisturethe redwoods depend on to thrive. As temperatures rise, life-giving fog evaporates from the coastal forests. Research published in2010showed that the average length of time that fog covered the forest decreased by more than three hours over the previous century. It’s unclear if this trend will continue as global warming becomes more severe, and if so, how—and if—coast redwoods will adapt. In the fight for survival, coast redwoods have something that many vulnerable species lack. Campbell says the tree’s popularity can help raise awareness around their conservation, and the conservation of trees in general. “I sort of think of them as the panda bear of trees,” he says, “the way that panda bears have become a global icon for wildlife conservation. I would like to see redwoods be the same for forests and for plants.” That charisma is what drives some people to hike through the wilderness to see Hyperion in person: They’re amazed that such an organism can exist, and they want to bear witness to it. But nature-lovers don’t need to stand beneath the tallest redwood to appreciate the majesty of the species. Every old-growth tree on the California coast is worth saving, and by leaving Hyperion off its map, Redwood National Park has emphasized that. ""I’m not being trite—it’s easy to miss the forest for the trees, right? If you’re just looking for that extra-tall one in a forest with already 350-foot-tall trees, you’re just trying to find the one that’s a wee bit bigger,"" Campbell says. “The forest itself is what the national park protects, and the whole forest is magnificent."""

And since spotted lanternflies spawn prolifically—they canlaynearly 200 egg masses on just one plant or other surfaces—they pose a serious threat to crops. “The economic impact could total in the hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs for those in the grapes, apple, hops, and hardwood industries,” the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculturewarns.

Lifehackerreportsit’s called thermal paper, and text is printed on it through heat transfer rather than ink. To make that process possible, manufacturers coat the paper in a chemical called bisphenol A, or BPA, which many people consider to be ahealthconcern for humans. In a nutshell, BPA closely resembles estradiol, a kind of estrogen, and can bind to estrogen receptors in our bodies. That mayinterferewith energy levels, cell repair, reproduction, and thyroid function. But, there isn’t enough evidence to demonstrate if or how BPA affects us, or how much you can safely be exposed to. Some studiessuggestit’s less dangerous than the general public thinks. In the absence of definitive answers, many companies have adopted a “better safe than sorry” attitude and made a concerted effort to stay away from using it in plastics and other products. For receipts, however, it’s still prevalent, and it might also be difficult to remove during the recycling process.According toRecyclebank, this means traces of BPA could end up in new paper products made from recycled materials. To avoid the risk, recyclers often try to keep it out in the first place.

85,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/648247/52-hertz-loneliest-whale-documentary,,"In 1989, a sonar surveillance system listening for Soviet submarines picked up a strange sound in the Pacific Ocean: a low, repetitive vibration with a frequency of 52 hertz. Navy officers initially attributed it to a machine, but eventually decided it must have come from a living creature. As for what kind, they didn’t know. By that time, theCold Warwas drawing to a close, and the Navy soon deemed it safe to share the data with unaffiliated scientists. Navy technician Joe George got in touch withWilliam A. Watkins, a leading expert in marine mammal bioacoustics, hoping he might be able to solve the mystery of the unfamiliar thrum. From 1992 until his death in 2004, Watkins and his colleagues at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution tracked the calls, which showed up in the North Pacific every year between August and February. In apaperpublished in the December 2004 issue ofDeep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers, the researchers concluded that itseemedlike a whale was responsible. Because the calls were always isolated, and they didn’t overlap with the movement of other baleen whales in the area—specifically blue, fin, andhumpback—the 52-hertz whale (or just “52 Hertz”) appeared to be something of a solitary figure. “Obviously, he’s able to eat and live and cruise around,” study co-author Mary Ann DahertoldThe Washington Post. “Is he successful reproductively? I haven’t the vaguest idea. Nobody can answer those questions. Is he lonely? I hate to attach human emotions like that. Do whales get lonely? I don’t know. I don’t even want to touch that topic.” While Daher and other researchers resisted making assumptions about the creature, the public latched onto the idea of the whale as an outcast, swimming alone and singing a tune that its fellow whales either couldn’t understand or simply wouldn’t respond to. Since 2004, the so-called “loneliest whale in the world” has become both mascot and muse for those who feel friendless or misunderstood. It’s inspired books, sculptures, tattoos, and other artistic tributes; even BTS released a song, “Whalien 52,” about it in 2015. But for all its emotional resonance, there’s quite a lot we don’t know about the whale—like, for example, whether it’s actually a whale. Scientists generally agree that chances are good, and the leadingtheoryis that it’s a hybrid of two whale species, perhaps blue and fin. Blue whale callsfallbetween 10 and 39 hertz, and fin whales usuallyvocalizein pulses at either 20 or 40 hertz. Blue-fin hybrids are a documented phenomenon, but their calls are not, so it’s possible that they sing at a slightly higher frequency than their parents. To try to prove (or disprove) the theories surrounding 52 Hertz, filmmaker Joshua Zeman embarked on a journey to locate the animal itself. He chronicled his endeavors in the recent documentaryThe Loneliest Whale: The Search for 52, available to stream now. Before beginning the search, Zeman first had to secure sponsors for his project—easier said than done, considering he couldn’t guarantee an outcome. “When we pitched the story, some places were like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s great; I love the story. But can you produce the whale?’ They would finance it if we knew we were going to find the whale,” Zeman toldThe Washington Post. “But what happens when we find the whale? What are we going to do? Are we going to hug it? The power is in the metaphor.” Zeman eventually reeled in a couple celebrities involved in ocean conservation efforts: Leonardo DiCaprio andEntourage’s Adrian Grenier. His next task was to enlist a team of experts who knew enough about tracking whales and analyzing their calls to give Zeman a fighting chance of finding a never-before-seen one.John Hildebrand, a professor of oceanography at the University of California San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography, not only brought his expertise in whale song to the mission, but also an invaluable lead. One of his interns had detected 52 Hertz’s call in California’s Santa Barbara Channel, suggesting that the whale might be still alive and relatively close by. John Calambokidis, a senior research biologist and co-founder of the Cascadia Research Collective, came on board, too, as didAna Širović, an associate professor of marine biology at Texas A&M University at Galveston. InOctober 2015, Zeman, the scientists, and other crew members set off on a week-long voyage around the channel to hunt for 52 Hertz. Using audio data from 1000-pound “sonobuoys” dropped in the water and drone footage, they hoped to locate whales in the area. Then, Calambokidis and his cohorts would head out in a smaller boat and tag the whales with suction-cup devices that captured both audio and video footage. If they happened to tag 52 Hertz, they’d likely be able to identify it. Since finding 52 Hertz was the primary goal of the entire venture, we’ll leave it up to the documentary to reveal whether it was achieved. But the film isn’t just about that single investigation. It explains how the discovery of whale song helped people view them as intelligent beings, fueling the 1960s movement to end commercial whaling. A current threat to marine ecosystems also gets some screen time: noise pollution from shipping, oil extraction, and other human activities. The participating scientists had other aims for the mission, too. “I knew I could get some useful data and information, whether we find the particular whale we were searching for or not,” Širović said in a press release. “We were able to record some cool footage of a blue whale singing underwater, which was the first such recording [obtained from tag data] which corroborated our previous understanding of how they call.” Hildebrand and Calambokidis had already been researching blue whale song together, so this particular trip was a continuation of that work. “We incrementally collected more data on blue whales in the Santa Barbara Channel,” Hildebrand tells Mental Floss. When it comes to whale communication, however, humans are still mostly in the dark. “The more we learn about whale song, the more idiosyncratic it appears,” Hildebrand says. “We don't know much about how whales respond to the calls of other whales. One theory is that females use the calls of males to select them for breeding, but that is just a theory. No one has seen a female react to the call of a male.” It’s also common for blue and fin whales to call when no other whales are around, Hildebrand explains. In short, 52 Hertz’s frequency is indeed higher than the usual frequency of blue and fin whale song; but it may seem so abnormal mainly because our understanding of what’s normal is based on limited data. And there is a lot more to we still need to understand. “Incredibly,” Hildebrand says, “new species of baleen whale are still being discovered.”"

Out of 250 different kinds of PET plastictestedover the past three years, LEGO has discovered one that seems to fit the bill. Their process [PDF] involves grinding down the bottle so it’s reduced to granular flakes, which are then cleaned and processed for durability. (The exact method is something the company appears to want to keep a trade secret.) The material is molded into bricks and then winds up on shelves. It’s estimated that for every 32-ounce beverage bottle recycled, LEGO could make as many as 10 4-inch-by-2-inch bricks. The company hasn’t yet disclosed whether entire playsets could be made of recycled plastic, or just random bricks. LEGO has been turning toward a more environmentally friendly business model for some time, with plans to make its manufacturing carbon-neutral by 2022 and its packaging sustainable by 2025. Some challenges for the eco-brick remain. LEGO will need to devise a way of using color dyes on the recycled material. It will also need to be compatible with all existing LEGO bricks. Currently, the brick is in the prototype stage. A testing phase is expected to last for a year before the company heads into a pilot phase.

AsThe Independentreports, they recently released development plans [PDF] mandating that all residential buildings constructed from this point on “use, where possible, recycled and renewable materials, lighter-colored roofs, and use lighter-colored materials and finishes on main external parts of the building.” “We need to say goodbye to the trend of having dark roofs that not only attract and retain heat and raise ambient street temperatures, but lead to astronomical electricity bills because of the need to cool homes,” Rob Stokes, New South Wales’s minister for planning and public spaces,toldThe Sydney Morning Herald.

Accordingto the Associated Press, the case marks the first time tree DNA was introduced in a federal trial. The case stemmed from a 2018 fire in Olympic National Forest in Washington that wound up spreading over 5.2 square miles. In the course of fighting and investigating the blaze, officials noticed that a number of the site’s valuable maple trees (often used to make guitars) had been sawed off rather than burned. Prosecutors said defendant Justin Andrew Wilke and co-conspirators took the trees and then sold them to a local lumber mill, with Wilkeclaimingthe trees were sourced legally elsewhere and with a valid permit. To challenge his argument, federal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington enlisted Richard Cronn, a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service. Using DNA, Cronn was able to demonstrate that the trees were a genetic match for what was left of the poached trees. The possibility of the DNA match being coincidental was just 1 in 1 decillion, or one 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. The fire, it turned out, was Wilke’s attempt to destroy a wasp’s nest before taking the tree. A jury convicted Wilke of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking of unlawfully harvested timber. Since there were no eyewitnesses to his starting the fire, he was not convicted of any related charges. While this marks the first time tree DNA resulted in a federal conviction, wood has played a role in other cases.

Arthur Kohler of the U.S. Forest Service was asked to identify the types of wood used to construct the ladder left on the scene. When authorities eventually arrested and tried Bruno Hauptmann for the crime, the jury saw evidence that wood in his home’s attic matched that of the ladder and some of his tools matched tool marks present on it.

It wasn’t exactly an underdog—the park has landed in first place every year since 1944. And by “national park,” we don’t mean any place overseen by the National Park Service. There are more than 420 of those, from national monuments to parkways; only about 60 are officially considered national parks. Yellowstone National Park, which hasn’t been the runner-up since 1947, finally returned to its former position of glory with 3.8 million visitors. Yellowstone unseatedGrand CanyonNational Park, which had sat in second place for three decades.Zion National Park,Rocky Mountain National Park, andGrand Teton National Parkall snuck by the Grand Canyon, too. With the exception of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the annual visitor count for the top 10 parks fell into a relatively narrow range: 2.4 million to 3.8 million. So what makes the Great Smoky Mountains such a highly trafficked spot?

The same gear that helps mitigate the spread of COVID-19 can harm the environment when not disposed of properly. AsPrestigereports, a Dutch designer has come up with an alternative to conventional disposable face masks that's as good for the planet as it is for you. The Marie Bee Bloom biodegradable face mask is meant to be planted in the ground when you're done using it. It doesn't contain any plastics or materials that won't break down outside. The strings are plain wool and the mask itself is made from rice paper. Instead of glue, the components are held together with potato starch. The delicate material means the mask isn'treusable, but its usefulness extends past its wearability. An old mask is capable of taking on new life—literally. Flower seeds are embedded in biodegradable fabric, so when you bury the mask in the ground you're also giving plants the chance to sprout. The product is the brainchild of Marianne de Groot-Pons, a graphic designer based in the Netherlands. According to her website, she felt inspired to design an eco-friendly face mask after seeing blue surgical masks littering the streets everywhere she went. Plantable masks may not be able to replace the protective gear we wear on a daily basis, but they may push people to think hard about what happens to their masks when they're done using them. Marie Bee Bloom face masks are available to purchase in packs of five, 10, and 15. You can buy them for roughly $3.50 apiece fromMarieBeeBloom.com. [h/tPrestige]"

You may have heard that you can’t recycle pizza boxes, but that’s not entirely true. Most pizza boxes are made from corrugated cardboard, which is recyclable under most circumstances. The material makes up most paper products collected for recycling, according to the New York StateDepartment of Environmental Conservation. If you need to get rid of an unsoiledpizza box, it’s fine to recycle it. Things get complicated, however, when the cardboard is covered in food matter. Pizza boxes tend to soak up grease from the pizza inside them, and soiled materials can’t be recycled. While it is sometimes possible to wash food off recyclables, grease stains are harder to remove from paper products. If you decide to put the box in the recycling bin anyway, it couldcontaminatethe items around it, creating more trash. Committed recyclers shouldn’t take this as an excuse to skippizzanight.

95,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/645217/lake-nyos-deadly-lakes,,"The evening of August 21, 1986, was like any other night around Lake Nyos, a deep crater lake high on the slopes of the Massif du Mbam mountain range in northwest Cameroon. Some residents of the local villages huddled around their cooking fires, tucking into alate dinner. Many others, tired froma busy dayat the market, werealready asleepin their grass-roofed huts. Around9:30p.m., those who remained awake heard a strange rumbling noise coming from the direction of Lake Nyos. Within minutes,nearly 1800people would be dead. That night, Lake Nyos expelled a jet of water over 300 feet high, releasing with it years' worth of carbon dioxide that had collected in the lake. A cloud of gas rose into the sky before descending over the hilltops and heading toward the unsuspecting villagers. At160 feet thickand traveling between 12 and 31 miles per hour, there was little chance of escaping it. As it swept past the huts, the hot cloud of carbon dioxide displaced the air, suffocating almost everyone it came into contact with until it eventually dissipated. Lake Nyos was known by locals asthe “good” lakefor its clean drinking water. But on that night in 1986, it was responsible for one of the deadliest natural disasters in African history. Nios, the village closest to the lake, was the worst affected. A man whotraveled to Nioson his motorbike the following day discovered it strewn with the bodies of people and animals. He couldn’t find a single person alive. The man rushed back to his village, Wum, around five miles away. The first survivors had just started to arrive. They later recalled choking on the air before passing out. Someremained unconsciousfor two days, only to wake up and find that their entire family had died. As word spread about the disaster,scientists flockedto Cameroon to try to understand what had happened. Tests of the water soon revealed the lake hadunusually high levelsof carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide levels were so high that when the scientists tried to pull the water samples to the surface, pressure from the gas caused the containers to burst. They theorized that carbon dioxide had accumulated at the bottom of Lake Nyos until something had disturbed it. That disturbance caused a chain reaction that forced the gas out from the bottom of the lake and into the atmosphere in a rare natural phenomenon called alimnic eruption. In the following months, U.S. research chemists found that the carbon dioxide levels in Lake Nyos were increasing at an alarming rate. Something had to be done to keep another disaster at bay. Geologists from the Cameroon Ministry of Mines, Water, and Powerproposed installing a pipe systeminto the lake designed to allow the controlled release of carbon dioxide from its bed up through the surface. Starting with small pipes the diameter of a garden hose, scientists began totest the ideain 1990, swapping them out for progressively larger pipes in the following years. Meanwhile, all villagers within an 18-mile radius of the lakewere evacuated. Their villages were destroyed to prevent them from going back. Though the pipes provided a temporary solution, there were still5500 tonsof carbon dioxide collecting in Lake Nyos every year from themagma chamberdeep below thevolcanic linethe crater lake sits atop. Funding was eventually secured to install the first permanent pipe in 2001, followed by an additional two pipes in 2011. It took another five years for the carbon dioxide to reach safe enough levels for villagersto returnand rebuild their communities—three decades after the disaster that had claimed so many of their friends and family. What triggered Lake Nyos's limnic eruption remains unknown. It could have been something as small as a rock falling into the water, or even astrong gust of wind. Once the scientists began figuring out what could have caused the disaster, they began to look for instances of similar eruptions [PDF]. It didn’t take them long to find one. Just two years earlier inLake Monoun, 59 miles away from Lake Nyos, nearby villagers heard a loud boom. In the following hours, 37 people mysteriously died. Until then, the strange occurrence hadn't garnered much attention. But in light of the Lake Nyos disaster, it was proof that the problem was greater than anticipated. Scientists now believe thatonly three lakesin the world accumulate such deadly levels of carbon dioxide in their depths—Nyos, Monoun, and Lake Kivu on the border of Congo and Rwanda. WhileLake NyosandLake Monounhave both been declared safe, the same cannot be said forLake Kivu. Around 2 million people live in the valleys surrounding the lake, which is1700 times biggerthan Lake Nyos and twice as deep. Though Rwanda has begun using methane from Lake Kivu as a source of energy, large scale efforts to completely de-gas the lake have yet to be made. Until that happens, history threatens to repeat itself as danger bubbles silently beneath the surface."

In July 2021, a lagoon in the area turned an eye-catching shade of magenta. It's not the only candy-colored body of water on Earth, but unlike the famous pink lakes in places likeAustralia, this one isn't natural. AsIndependentreports, the deep pink color of the Corfo lagoon is the result of pollution from local fish factories. The factories use an antibacterial agent, sodium sulfite, to preserve prawns before shipping them. When waste containing the product contaminated the lagoon earlier this month, it gave the waters an unnatural hue. The shocking color change is part of a pattern ofenvironmental issuesplaguing the area; locals have previously complained about unpleasant odors caused by runoff from the fish processing plants. Images of the polluted lagoon are reminiscent of the famous Lake Hillier in Australia. Though it looks just as artificial as the water in Argentina, Lake Hillier's bubblegum-pink color is a natural product of its ecosystem. Though its causes aren't totally clear, experts believe the Australian lake is tinted by a reddish type of algae calledDunaliella salina. The body's high salinity makes the perfect environment for the tiny creatures, which could explain their overwhelming presence in the water. Lake Hillier isn't the world's only naturally pink lake, but it is notable for sporting the color year-round. Corfo's pink shade is a sign of something much different. Juan Micheloud, head of environmental control for the region, toldAFPthat the chemicals won't harm the lake and the odd color will go away on its own after a few days. Activists and residents are skeptical, however, and they're demanding that local industries do more to lessen their impact on the environment. [h/tIndependent]"

It’s late morning on the polar ice when Eric Larsen unzips his tent to find white-out conditions obscuring everything from view. He’s had just a few hours of sleep, and he still overslept. Today he and his expedition partner, Ryan Waters, are making their final push to the North Pole, less than four miles away. But the whipping wind is pushing the big ice floe where they set up camp southward, and every moment counts. At this point, the two veteran adventurers have spent 53 days inching across the Arctic sea ice, and today will be another slog through slushy leads and over hummocks. When they began planning this expedition, they expected it to be treacherous. That was the point. They wanted to show the world how climate change was already wreaking havoc on the North Pole—in fact, they’re calling this the Last North Expedition. They predict that their method of reaching the Pole on foot will soon be impossible. Now it’s May 2014. The ice groans beneath them. They have to fight to gain ground in a landscape that wants to undermine their every step. The roaring wind pushes ice floes apart, revealing open water. If they’re going to make it to the North Pole, they’ll need to don their dry suits, jump in, and start swimming. After eight hours, they’re almost there. Larsen whips out his camera. Waters begins to count down the meters. At last, the GPS shows the coordinates the two men have been longing to see: 90° North. There is no flag waiting to greet them, no plaque denoting what is, to some explorers, the most sought-after spot on the map. Just wind and ice—and the knowledge that they may be the last two people to ever reach the North Pole this way. Once secure in their tent, they tuck into a tube of Pringles before indulging in a celebratory meal and sleeping for a solid 36 hours. By the time they wake up, the ice has already drifted 9 miles south. The North Pole, the place at the top of the world they and so many before them have battled to see, is once again out of reach. One hundred and twelve years after Peary and Henson allegedly laid claim to the Pole, and 53 years after Ralph Plaisted drove a snowmobile to 90° North, where does the legacy of North Pole exploration fit into our world? And would the explorers of the past even recognize the Arctic today? We’re about to find out. From Mental Floss and iHeartRadio, this is The Quest for the North Pole. I’m your host, Kat Long, science editor at Mental Floss, and this is our final episode: The North Pole Today. There is a real irony about our knowledge of the North Pole. People spent more than four centuries attempting to get to the Pole to observe what was there. They faced incredibly difficult journeys through ice-choked seas and over lands carved by massive glaciers. By the time they got close, in the 20th century, it was already changing dramatically because of human activity. Our idea of the North Pole, as observed by the most daring explorers in history, became obsolete in fewer than 100 years. And today, global warming is changing the Arctic in every way. The impacts of climate change are evident in its geography, oceans, lands, animals, and people. In our first episode, we said that an important goal of early Arctic exploration was to locate the magnetic North Pole. We always knew that thegeographicNorth Pole was at 90° North latitude—that’s just the spot on the map where all the meridians of longitude converge. But the magnetic North Pole is a different beast. Its location affects navigational instruments, and when explorers didn’t know where the magnetic pole was, their navigational readings could be way off. During British explorer John Ross’s four-year odyssey in the Northwest Passage, from 1829 to 1833 in the shipVictory, his nephew and crewmemberJames Clark Rosswalked all over the Boothia Peninsula looking for the magnetic north pole. He carried a compass with a dipping needle—an instrument that responded to the proximity of magnetic north by pointing downward. Near Cape Adelaide on the western edge of the peninsula, Ross saw the needle pointstraight downto the Earth—magnetic ground zero. The coordinates were approximately 70° 05’ N, 96° 46' W, more than a thousand nautical miles south of the geographic North Pole. But the coordinates for the magnetic North Pole aren’t set in stone, or in ice. As of 2020, its coordinates were86.50°N and 164.04°E, hundreds of nautical miles north of where it was when James Clark Ross discovered it. This change isn’t unusual, because as we mentioned in episode 1, the location of magnetic North has always fluctuated. In the mid-20th century, the magnetic North Pole shifted by around 9 miles per year. But in recent years, it’s changed much more rapidly: As of the early aughts, magnetic north was galloping about34 miles per year. The Arctic is changing rapidly in more noticeable ways. On June 20, 2020, the temperature in the Siberian village of Verkhoyansk hit 100.4°F, about 30 degrees above normal. This was reportedly thehottest temperature ever recordedinside the Arctic Circle, and it was part of a larger trend. The Arctic is the warmest it’s been in3 millionyears. The region has warmed aroundtwo timesfaster than the rest of Earth. In the 2010s, the temperature was at least 1.8°F above average in nine out of 10 years. This may seem like a small amount, but it has massive consequences. It’s forcing the region into apositive feedback loop—which, despite how it sounds, is actually a negative thing. Usually, sea ice reflects up to80 percentof the sunlight that strikes it. But as the Arctic warms, ice is replaced by dark open water, which absorbs light and heat. And as that open water sucks in more heat from the sun, more ice melts, and the scary cycle continues. That’sKristin Laidre, a marine biologist at the University of Washington. She’s been studying Arctic marine mammals around Greenland for about 20 years, looking at how mammal populations are adapting to climate change. Record-high temps have also led torecord-low snow cover, and that increases the risk for wildfires. Wildfire season also kicked off earlier than usual. The blazes might have been triggered by so-called “zombie fires,” which are fires that smolder in the dense layer of peat underneath the snow and ice. Peatlands happen to be the world’s most important terrestrial ecosystem for carbon storage. And when they burn, tons of greenhouse gases are released into our atmosphere. Higher temps are meltingpermafrost, too. While this sometimes reveals cool fossils like mammoth bones, it also releases ridiculous amounts of carbon and methane, not to mention super-bad stuff likeanthrax,infectious viruses, and otherdangerous microbes. And when permafrost becomes unstable, the ground doesn’t hold together as well. Along Alaska’s coast, the equivalent of30 football fieldsof land disappear each year due to erosion. Though past explorers would definitely have appreciated less ice in their way, climate scientists cite the decrease in sea ice as one of the most worrying changes in the Arctic today. In 2007, after a century of steadily warming temperatures, the Northwest Passage was completelyice-freein summer for the first time in recorded history. The years since then have also seen ice-free summers. And just this past February, a commercial ship successfully made amid-winter voyageacross the Northeast Passage that winds around Russia and China—the same route that defeated William Barents in the 16th century. Here’s Andrea Pitzer, author ofIcebound: Shipwrecked At the Edge of the World, which tells the story of Barents’s three voyages. In 2019, she retraced Barents’s steps to his hut on Nova Zembla, where he and his men were forced to spend the winter in 1596. In the best-case scenarios, ice made navigation difficult for explorers of the past. In the worst cases, sea ice would bash into their ships, squeeze them until they sank, or surround them in a solid mass. This might be less of an issue today, because the sea ice extent—which the United States Environmental Protection Agency defines as “the area of ocean where at least 15 percent of the surface is frozen”—is dwindling. Though satellites have been tracking the conditions only since 1979, century-old ship’s logbooksrevealthat sea ice used to be much more extensive. Satellites have captured drastic changes in thesea ice minimum. That is the point, usually at the end of the summer, when sea ice covers the smallest area for the whole year. Since 1979, its minimum has decreased by roughly32,000 square milesevery decade. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, that’s an area roughly four times the size of Maine. The lowest sea ice minimum ever recorded happened in September 2012, and 2020 was the second-lowest. No ice escapes this cycle. Take the gigantic slabs ofpaleocrystic icethat George Strong Nares observed on his attempt at the North Pole in 1875. These huge masses are important for seals, which make their burrows in the ice, and polar bears, which hunt the seals for food. A current called the Beaufort Gyre sends the oldest, thickest ice churning toward Canada and Greenland’s northern shore. It forms a protective dam across the Nares Strait, blocking older ice from drifting south to warmer waters—it’s what Nares thought would forever block explorer’s progress to the North. Its Inuktut name isTuvaijuittuq, which translates to “the place where the ice never melts.” But warmer temps make the barrier weaker, and more of the paleocrystic ice—which we once took for granted would be permanently frozen—isescapingfrom the Nares Strait and melting away. As a result, the sea route to the Pole that Nares, in theAlertandDiscovery, found completely blocked is more open today. And the ice that remains throughout the year isthinner and more vulnerablethan in the past. The well-trodden “American route” blazed by Charles Francis Hall, Elisha Kent Kane, and Robert Peary in the 19th century, now looks completely different. Here’s Susan Kaplan, a professor of anthropology and director of the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum at Bowdoin College. A consequence of less ice is thatmore shipshave an easier time getting around the Arctic. Between 2016 and 2019, shipping along the Northeast Passage increased 58 percent. Not only does this mean more noise,pollution, and traffic, but alsoinvasive speciesthat hitch a ride on the ships, more efforts to extractArctic natural resources, and even commercial cruises. In 2016, acruisetraversed the Northwest Passage, allowing rich tourists to browse the same places that explorers had fought tooth and nail to reach in previous centuries. And some tour operators really know how to sell the romance of it all. That’s P.J. Capelotti, author ofThe Greatest Show in the Arctic: The American Exploration of Franz Josef Land, 1898–1905, which recounts expeditions to these islands in the Russian Arctic. When he visited Nansen and Johansen’s dugout shelter on Franz Josef Land, he started photographing some walrus bones next to the hut, thinking they had been left behind by the explorers in 1896. Before that famous expedition, Nansen and his hardy band of Norwegian comrades crossed the Greenland ice sheet, the largest in the Northern Hemisphere, from its east to west coast in 1888. Robert Peary and Matthew Henson traversed the ice sheet from west to east in 1892 and in 1895. In Peary’s case, they barely made it back alive. That ice sheet is melting faster than it has in the last12,000 years. Today, it’s losing ice seventimes fasterthan it did in the 1990s. And this trend goes way beyond the Arctic lands. Between 1994 and 2017, Earth lost 28 trillion tons of ice. It is really difficult to imagine how much 28 trillion tons actually is, but here’s an attempt at a comparison. In 2017, one of the largest icebergs ever recorded broke off from Antarctica. It weighed about1 trillion tons, and it was the size of Delaware. In the last decade, Earth haslosta Delaware-sized mass of ice each year. All that melting ice gets dumped into the ocean, raising sea levels around the world. Meltwater pouring off Greenland’s ice sheet is one of the largestcontributorsto rising sea levels. All that fresh, cold water isaltering ocean currents—the type of thing that Nansen’s second expedition, in theFram, was meant to study. We’ll be right back. Climate change is having a major impact on Arctic flora and fauna. And what would Arctic literature be without encounters with potentially lethal wildlife? From the polar bears that stalked William Barents and the castaways on Nova Zembla, to the walruses and narwhals hunted for their tusks, to the musk ox that saved Peary and Henson from starvation, Arctic animals provided sustenance, clothing, shelter, and fuel for every generation of polar explorer—and the Inuit, whose entire cultures depend on them. But climate change is challenging the animals’ survival. Polar bears, those ferocious carnivores that menaced explorers, are more often portrayed as victims of climate change today. The image of an emaciated bear swimming great distances between chunks of sea ice, shaggy white fur draping from too-prominent ribs, is a staple of environmental activism. Some scientistsestimatethat almost all of the 19 polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic could disappear by the end of this century. Polar bears depend on sea ice for hunting seals, theirmain sourceof food. The bears need the energy they store from the fat seals to be able to survive during times when food is scarce. As more and more ice disappears, the bears are forced to retreat onto land, where the meals are few and far between. Fewer food sources means the animals must go longer without it, and that hurts their ability to reproduce andraise cubs. Walruses also need sea ice. It’s important for their mating, and when they’re not hunting food, these one-ton mammals lounge on it in huge groups, soaking up the Arctic sun. But, if there aren’t enough floes to go around, walruses have to swim farther to gather in these groups, known as “haul outs,” on land. Hundreds of walruses pile onto one spot, which is not ideal when most of the walruses have a pair of up to three-foot tusks sticking out of their mouths. As anyone who’s ever found themselves stuck in a mosh pit knows, this type of situation can get very dangerous, very fast. Sometimes, these land-based haul outs become so large and unwieldy, the walrusestrample each other. All of these marine mammals are closely tied to the sea ice for all the functions of their lives, as Kristin Laidre explains. Probably no animal is more associated with the North Pole than Santa’s reindeer, but even these herbivores are in trouble. In recent years, reindeer populations have dropped byover 50 percent, and the likely reasons are not pretty. For instance, longer summers giveparasitic flies, like botflies, more opportunities to lay their eggs in the caribou’s skin or its nose. As you might imagine, this forces the caribou to spend more time fending off flies and less time eating, which has a terrible effect on their populations. Losing caribou would be devastating for the Indigenous people who have a deep cultural connection to them forfoodand skins, which are used to make clothing, tents, and other necessities. Arctic explorers of the past may not have relied on reindeer to travel Santa-style across the ice, but like the peoples of the far north, they also relied on them for sustenance. Like the intrepid humans before them, some animals are extending their ranges northward as the planet warms. Red foxes, those wily canids found across vast regions of the world, have begun their own Arctic expeditions. Their northern expansion isdisplacing the native Arctic fox. The opportunistic red foxes compete for den sites and food sources, and, at times, kill the native foxes. This trend is happening in marine environments, too. Here’s Kristin Laidre. Inuit and other Arctic peoples have the most to lose from all of these dramatic shifts. Inuit assisted explorers, and saved their lives, over the course of four centuries. Now, they’re on the front lines of climate change. All of the threats we’ve mentioned so far—to animals, ice, sea levels, and more—have a direct impact on polar communities’ survival. Indigenous peoples have also left behind evidence of their thousands of years in the Arctic. More than 180,000 archaeological sites are scattered across the Arctic. Because the region is so cold, items like bones, fabrics, and skins were once remarkably well-preserved in permafrost. But the warming ground exposes these treasures to decay. Coastal erosion is also wiping out ancient settlements and burial sites, some of whichcontaintraces of the earliest known migrations to North America. One of them wasNuvugaq, a smattering of sod houses and a communal building used byInuvialuitwhale hunters, that the explorer John Franklin observed in 1826. Less than 200 years later, that site has been claimed by the sea. Rising seas and thawing permafrost are wiping away Arctic explorers’ own marks on the region. Here’s P.J. Capelotti. On Franz Josef Land, evidence of Walter Wellman’sill-fated North Pole expeditionhas escaped erosion thus far. The American journalist-turned-explorer led an expedition across Franz Josef Land in 1898. As part of that, they constructeda hut at Cape Heller, located at the 81st parallel. After Bentsen died, his sole companion that winter spent weeks living alone in the fort, sleeping beside the corpse of his dead comrade. We’ll be right back. Explorers from as recently as the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries found it impossible to sail to the North Pole. Ice completely blocked their way—and put the age-old theory of an Open Polar Sea to rest. William Edward Parry, Fridtjof Nansen, Robert Peary, and others tried to walk, ski, or dogsled to the Pole over solid sea ice. As late as 1968, Ralph Plaisted and his buddies were able to drive snowmobiles to the North Pole. But today, those modes would be virtually impossible. One of the last human-powered expeditions to the Pole took place in 2014. On their expedition dubbedLast North, American adventurers Eric Larsen and Ryan Waters departed from the coast of Ellesmere Island, just like Peary had done in 1909, over 400 nautical miles from the Pole. But that was about all they had in common with the explorers of a century before. Larsen and Waters traded the traditional sled dogs for skis and snowshoes. They dragged their 317-pound sleds behind them across the ice. They were alone and entirely unsupported. There was no team of explorers helping them break ground; no strategically planned food drops to replenish their supplies. They worked like the human versions of a dog sledding team, hitching themselves to one sled at a time to lug them up and over the 20-foot-tall ice ridges that fragmented their route. Instead of donning handmade fur suits like Peary and Henson, Larsen and Waters looked as though they’d just stepped out of REI. They wore layers and layers of merino wool and down garments and heavy-duty boots to stave off the freezing temperatures. Rather than ration pemmican and ship’s biscuit, their food provisions included state-of-the-art dehydrated meals—plus some things anyone could pick up at a local grocery store to ensure they could scarf down over7000 calories per day. They packed energy bars, salami, cheese, nuts, Pringles, and three bags of cheese puffs, which were designated as a celebratory treat. Perhaps most surprisingly, the two men also packed 25 servings of freeze-dried ice cream—because nothing creates a craving for ice cream like spending weeks on ice. But even with high-tech gear and abundance of high-calorie food, Larsen and Waters battled for survival on their journey to the Pole. Like Robert Peary, they didn’t take kayaks or rafts with them. To cross open water, they had drysuits—and they swam. Those waterproof suits were crucial to their success. Cracks in the ice revealed great ribbons of open water all the way to the horizon. Where these gaps blocked their progress, the two men swam, pulling their buoyant sledges while paddling and kicking with their limbs. They had to act as their own icebreakers to shatter ice that was too thin to walk across, but too thick to easily swim through. Air trapped in their drysuits kept them afloat, but smashing a path forward, then pulling themselves back atop solid ice like seals flopping on shore, was exhausting. Even the miles they trekked across solid ice were perilous. It’s hard to keep a steady pace when the ground beneath your feet is always changing. Ice that in some places was thick and solid was in other areas so deceivingly thin; one wrong step could send an explorer plunging into freezing water. It cracked around them as they slept and threatened to shatter beneath them as they inched forward. Relentless wind sent the ice floes careening southward as the men fought to continue north: In the time it took them to pause and don their drysuits before swimming across a lead, the ice floes would drift south and set them back by as much as a quarter-mile. Polar bear prints in the snow were unnerving reminders that in the Arctic, it’s not just the ice and cold that can leave a man fighting for his life. On day five of the expedition, a mother polar bear and her cub came within 15 feet of Larsen and Waters as they slogged forward. Their noses twitched as the mens’ scents wafted through the crisp air. Waters fired his flare, but the bears remained unfazed. The yearling cub, which weighed several hundred pounds, started forward, investigating what must have seemed like strange-looking seals lumbering upright across the frozen ground. Larsen, realizing their gun was nearby, shot into the air, was finally able to scare the bears away. Their muscles ached and sores speckled their skin. Stress and exhaustion frayed their nerves. Even worse, they were low on food. The thin, erratic ice slowed their forward progression to a crawl. By day 40, the two realized they’d need to drastically increase their pace if they had any hope of setting foot at the top of the world. But since they couldn’t ski any faster, they’d have to go harder. They slept for just four hours at a time, and spent up to 15 hours a day attempting to gain miles across the dicey landscape. Each step was like playing Russian roulette with the ice. On day 53, Larsen and Waters finally reached the North Pole. A mere 42 hours later, a small plane dropped from the sky to scoop them up and ferry them back to civilization. Within moments of liftoff, the limitless patchwork of ice and water they had traversed vanished beneath the clouds. The dangerous conditions they encountered reinforced the assumption that the Last North expedition would be one of the final human-powered treks to the Pole. Adventurers of the future who want to follow in Peary’s, Plaisted’s, or even Larson’s footsteps are likely out of luck. The sea ice that forms at the Pole each year rarely touches land. But, that doesn’t mean the North Pole is out of reach. Today’s adventurers, scientists, and even tourists regularly visit the top of the world, but their modes of travel are thoroughly modern. Most arrive near the Pole by research ship or cruise vessel. After a few hours, they return to their ship. The price for this momentary contact runsabout $30,000a pop. The recentMOSAiC Expeditionsought to recreate Fridtjof Nansen’s famous voyage in theFram, which we talked about in our third episode. To study polar ocean currents, Nansen purposefully got his small ship stuck into polar sea ice and let the currents take it where they may. The international team of scientists on the MOSAiC expedition did the same with their modern icebreaker,Polarstern. The vessel remained icebound while the researchers made scientific observations of climate change and compared their data to Nansen’s from the 1890s. Nansen eventually realized the currents wouldn’t take theFramto the Pole, so he attempted to get there by dogsled. In contrast, in August 2020, thePolarsternsailedeasily to the North Pole amid slushy floes, not the solid ice fields of yesteryear. A series of aerial photographs taken on the day the ship reached 90° North shows the surface of the Arctic Ocean as, well, a mosaic of thin patchy ice, streams of slush, and blue water. Climate scientists are fond of saying “what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic.” It’s easy to think of the Arctic or the North Pole as a place that’s not only geographically distant, but some place far away from modern civilization. That’s how Europeans in the early 19th century were able to romanticize the Arctic. They projected their hopes and dreams upon what they considered a blank slate—those empty spaces on the map. The polar regions appeared pure, sublime, and tantalizing; something to be celebrated in poetry and tamed by technology. But today, we know that isn’t the whole picture. Explorers went ever farther into uncharted territory. They observed the people, the animals, the climate. They mapped coastlines, islands, and waterways. And as they studied and learned more about the Arctic, they realized it was not as remote as they had thought. I believe that we’re still learning this lesson. The actions that we take today have a direct effect on the Arctic, and those effects will reverberate back to us. Here’s Kristin Laidre. Those are just two simplified examples of how connected we are to the Arctic, no matter where we live, or whether we’ll ever go there. I became interested in Arctic history because of my familial connection to it. Reading about explorers and their expeditions was how I came to understand some of the perils that region is facing now. My hope is that, by listening to the daring adventures and complex personalities of the past, we all learn to care more about the present and future Arctic. Caring about something is the first step toward protecting it. And we need to include everyone in that story. An inescapable fact of polar exploration is that it was conducted mainly by Westerners, who were mainly white and mainly men. Many explorers left a harmful legacy among the Native communities they encountered and places they went. Because of that, people who aren’t in this privileged group might feel like the story of exploration isn’t theirs, or has no relevance to their lives. But climate change in the Arctic affects everyone, and only collectively can we try to stop it. We must tell stories that are more inclusive and about why the Arctic’s past, present, and future is important, so everyone is engaged in protecting the natural heritage of our planet. The quest for the North Pole is more than the people who tried to reach it or succeeded in conquering it. It’s a doorway through which we can examine our own history and human nature. It’s a symbol for the human desire for knowledge and the struggle to understand ourselves. It reveals our shortcomings and urges us toward action. Whether we learn from the past, and take action now, is the choice we face. The Quest for the North Pole is hosted by me, Kat Long.

99,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/640990/compostable-vs-biodegradable-difference,,"When considering whether something is likely to wind up spending years in a landfill, the termscompostableandbiodegradablecome up. On the surface, the two seem interchangeable. Both imply materials—typically those used in packaging or in products like soap, bags, or cups—can be returned to the earth. But there are actually a few keydifferencesto keep in mind. If something is biodegradable, it means it will eventually break down in the presence of bacteria, fungi, or other naturally occurring conditions in soil. Typically, this means thingsderivedfrom plants,animals, or natural minerals. Even plastic, widely believed to be outside of this definition, is biodegradable, though biodegradable-resistant might be a better term. It can take hundreds of years for plastic to succumb to the elements. Any product that will eventually break down to carbon dioxide and water is technically biodegradable, though the idea that it could take centuries certainly affects its environmental profile. Compostableactually refers to two different things. If something organic is compostable, it means you can add it to a compost pile to use as fertilizer—think food or leaves. But in terms of packaging,compostablemeans it can become compost under the right conditions. Something labeled compostable needs to be processed in an industrial composting facility to live up to that promise. According to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), a compostable product needs to biodegrade by 90 percent within 180 days in a dedicated facility. If it’s simply thrown into a landfill, there’s no telling when it might break down. Ultimately, both biodegradable and compostable items are good for the environment, but it’s a matter of timing. A compostable item can degrade faster, but only under the right conditions. Items labeled biodegradable usually have to break down within a year, but don’t return resources to soil like compostable items can. It's something to keep in mind the next time you make an environmentally sound purchase. [h/tPJPOnline.com]"

It's concealed inside a sinkhole cave, and the only way in is by swimming or kayaking through a water tunnel. Though it looks like a natural marvel, the cave around the hidden beach may have been created by human activity within the last century. According toAtlas Obscura, Mexico started using the uninhabited Marieta Islands off the coast of the Riviera Nayarit to test bombs in the early 1900s. The controlled explosions changed the landscape, creating caves,craters, and most likely the sinkhole above Playa del Amor. The practice continued for decades, and in the 1960s, scientist Jacques Cousteau launched a campaign to conserve the island chain's natural resources. The Mexican government made the Marieta Islands a national park in response to the protests. Later, the site was declared a UNESCO MAB Biosphere Reserve. Parque Nacional Islas Marietas is a protected area today, but tourists are allowed to visit on alimited basis. After traveling through the spot's one narrow entryway, visitors are allowed to sunbathe beneath the circular patch of sky and swim in the clear water. Thanks to conversation efforts, the beach is also a great place to see wildlife that's returned to the area. [h/tAtlas Obscura]"

It’s a controversial condiment that doesn’t have quite the same widespread appeal asketchup or mustard. But if you ask animal conservationists, there’s no debate: Mayonnaise has become an unlikely ally in the fight to save endangered green sea turtles. According to theAssociated Press, a recent oil spill on Israel’s coast has created an environmental crisis for wildlife. More than 1000 tons of tar have washed ashore over 120 miles. Sea turtles native to the region are being subjected to the toxic substance that covers their bodies and enters their digestive systems. Rescued turtles have been moved to the Sea Turtle Rescue Center in Michmoret to receive treatment. “They all got here with a coat of tar on their heads, and in their eyes, nostrils, mouth, digestive system, and stomach,” Yaniv Levy, founder of the center, told Israel news outletHaaretz.com. “With this kind of damage they have no chance to survive without treatment. We removed the tar from their nostrils and eyes so they could breathe and see.” To flush the tar out, conservationists have found that mayonnaise is an effective solution. First, vegetable oil is used to thin the tar. Then, turtles are fed the condiment via a syringe, which dilutes the tar and allows it to be flushed out of their digestive tract. Because mayonnaise has proteins and fats, it’s also nourishing for the turtles, who are right now subsisting almost exclusively on an all-mayo diet. Currently, 27 turtles are being treated. Though the turtles begin to respond to care within days, it could be weeks or months before they’re ready to be released back into the wild, pending results of their bloodwork. Israel’s Environmental Protection Ministry is still investigating the cause of the spill. [h/tFood & Wine]"

After staying dormant for roughly 6000 years, the volcano awoke with a violent eruption on March 19, 2021.

According toThe Guardian, killer whales—the largest member of the dolphin family—have been ramming into boats off the Spanish coast in what some observers believe are deliberate attacks. Reports oforcas confronting boatshave been coming in from sailors across southern Spain for the past two months. In some cases, the damage has been significant, with boats losing parts of their rudders. Some crew members have been wounded from the jolts. These do not appear to be accidental encounters. In one incident last Friday afternoon near A Coruña, a port city in northwestern Spain, a yacht was pummeled by an orca about 15 times. The damaged vessel had to be towed into port. Other attacks have seen groups oforcas, known aspods, team up to smash boats. Near Cape Trafalgar, nine orcas spent more than an hour crashing into a boat, and eventually disabled the engine. The skipper said the whales had been communicating bywhistlingduring the encounter. Scientists aren't entirely sure what’s causing this aggressive behavior, though it’s possible that just one pod is responsible for all of the attacks. Oneexplanationcould be stress due to scarce resources in the area, as humans fish the tuna the whales thrive on; another is that eyewitness reports are not from trained researchers, ascribing behavior that might not match the intention of the orcas, who have been known to interact with boats and their rudders with curiosity. One theory is even related to the currentcoronaviruspandemic: As fewer vessels left port during lockdowns, the whales may have grown accustomed to quieter waters. As activity picked up, they responded to the increased commotion and disruption by attacking. But could they really be expressing anger? For some scientists, the answer is yes. Decades of fishing nets and ship noise in their territory, plus a dwindling food supply, means that orcas could be identifying boats and their human occupants as stress factors. And they might be starting to respond in kind. [h/tThe Guardian]"

It surpasses the termmegafire, a fire that consumes over 100,000 acres. The August Complex, which began with a series of lightning strikes, is the state’s first-ever gigafire, though not the country’s. In 2004, the Taylor Complex in Alaska destroyed 1.3 million acres. In 1988, the Yellowstone Fire took 1.58 million acres in Montana in Idaho. Acomplexis often used to describe a group of smaller fires which may or may not begin to burn together. The August Complex began as 300 individual fires that eventuallyjoinedtogether. The termgigafireis thought to have originated in the comments section of theWildfire Todaywebsite. In 2017, a visitor to the site with the screenname “kevin9” proposed that fires consuming over 1 million acres should be dubbedgigafires. The site began using the term for wildfires that met or exceeded that threshold in Australia.

Sea cucumbers offer something a little less conventional:poop, and lots of it. According to a recentstudypublished in the journalCoral Reefs, the black sea cucumbers (Holothuria atra) along one segment of theGreat Barrier Reefproduce more than 64,000 metric tons of excrement each year—or about the mass of five Eiffel Towers. Though arriving at that estimate didn’t entail physically measuring every metric ton, researchers did spend a memorable 24 hours “spooning poo,” as reef ecologist and study co-author Vincent RaoulttoldThe Guardian. The researchers used drones and satellites to estimate that more than 3 million black sea cucumbers live on the outer and inner coral reefs bordering Heron Island off Queensland, Australia. In order to approximate how much feces that population generates annually, they first had to determine how much one sea cucumber poops in a single day. So the team monitored individual specimens in tanks. “Every hour we would sit there, and take a spoon, and collect the little fecal pellets these sea cucumbers would produce,” Raoult explained. They found that each sea cucumber is responsible for around 38 grams of poop per day, which they extrapolated to arrive at roughly 64,000 metric tons across the whole reef per year. More research is needed before we draw any conclusions about how this affects the health of the reef and its other inhabitants, but it’s likely a good thing. Sea cucumber defecation is a method of bioturbation, meaning it helps stir up sediments on the ocean floor. This can release nutrients vital to the ecosystem—like calcium carbonate, which makes up coralskeletonsand other organisms’ shells. As oceansabsorbthe carbon dioxide released when we burn fossil fuels, the water becomes more acidic, and calcium carbonate structures deteriorate more rapidly. In other words, sea cucumber poop could be freeing up additional calcium carbonate, which helps coral reefs resist the effects ofclimate change. Again, more research is needed, but it’s possible we should be celebrating the excretory achievements of Heron Island’s sea cucumbers much like we do with newly potty-trained toddlers.

The North Polehas no land massat all. Instead, it’s made up of huge ice floes, 6 to 10 feet thick, that float on the surface of the Arctic Ocean. Beneath the ice, the water is 13,400 feet deep. At the North Pole, there is only eitherlight or darkness. The sun rises around the spring equinox on March 20 and stays in the sky for a full six months before finally setting around the fall equinox on September 22. Through the winter, the North Pole is dark 24 hours a day until the sun finally begins to reappear in March. In the early 20th century, the North Pole was one of the last places on Earth yet to be “discovered.” That changed in 1909 when, in the same September week, newspapers reported that not one but two explorers had made it to the top of the world. The famous American explorerRobert E. Pearyclaimed to have reached his destination in April 1909, his eighth attempt. But another American explorer, Frederick E. Cook, came out of nowhere to claimhewas first in April 1908, a full year before Peary. Despite the competing reports, Peary was widely acknowledged as the first at the North Poleuntil 1988when, after re-examining his records, the National Geographic Society concluded that he might not have made it to the North Pole after all. Even if he did, it’s likely that his teammates,Matthew Hensonand four Inughuit guides Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah, were actually the first toset foot at the pole—because Peary had to ride on a sled due to the loss of eight toes to frostbite. Unlike inAntarctica, where permanent research stations were establishedas earlyas the 1940s, there is no equivalent at the North Pole. The Soviet Union established the first temporary research station therein 1937. Planes dropped four men, including an oceanographer, a meteorologist, and a radio operator, on a 10-foot-thick ice floe in March, and over the next year theystudiedthe Arctic environment. When the expedition concluded in February 1938, rescuers found the station not where they left it, but drifting in the Greenland Sea, 1615 miles away. After several failed rescue attempts, all four researchers were safely evacuated and returned home. Santa Claus, the North Pole’s most famous resident, didn’t always live within the Arctic Circle. Saint Nicholas, the 4th-century religious figure from whom the myth of Santa Claus is derived, came from Myra, a Roman town in what is now Turkey. But in the mid-1800s, cartoonist Thomas Nast begandepictingthe saintly character as we know him today: fat, jolly, and with a sack full of toys. Because a flurry of American and European expeditions to the Arctic captured the world’s imagination around the same period, Nast selected the fabled location for Santa’s permanent home. In 2007, two Russian submarinesembarkedon a record-breaking dive to the seabed of the North Pole, two-and-a-half miles beneath the surface of the Arctic Ocean. But it was oil and gas, not the thrill of exploration, that drove their expedition. On the ocean floor, the submarines planted a 3-foot Russian flag made of corrosion-resistant titanium, staking its claim to what is believed to be almost a quarter of the Earth’s oil and gas reserves underneath. Russia argued that the North Pole is merely an extension of the Lomonosov Ridge, an underwater chain of hills extending from the Russian mainland, and therefore Russian territory. Denmark argued that the ridge is actually an extension of Greenland, and thus Danish territory. While Russia congratulated itself for the move, the rest of the world was not amused. More than a decade on,Russia’s claimto the North Pole’s resourceshas notbeen recognized by the United Nations. Despite the frigid and fluctuating climate, the Arctic is incredibly biodiverse. More than21,000 speciesof plants and animals are adapted to the extreme landscapes. But at the North Pole, where there is no land or terrestrial flora and fauna, wildlife is fewer and farther between. Arctic cod, shrimp, and crustaceans live at various depths under the sea ice, while the most common sights above the ice are migrating birds, such as Arctic terns, fulmars, kittiwakes, and snow buntings. In 1987, Tokyo motorcycle shop owner and racerShinji Kazamaleft Canada’s Ward Hunt Island bound for the North Pole on his Yamaha TW200. Kazama and the five members of his support team traveled 1250 miles over sea ice inconditions so extremethat, at times, the motorcycle could only travel 30 feet per hour. It took the adventurer 44 days to reach his destination. Five years later, in 1992, Kazama completed the same feat at the South Pole, becoming the first and only person to have ever reached both poles by motorcycle. Since 2003, the North Pole has hosted an Aprilmarathonfor the world’s most extreme athletes. The 26.2-mile race is run on a hard snow and ice track with competitors braving frigid temperatures that, in past years, have dropped as low as -20°F (-29°C). The current record for the fastest time at the FWD North Pole Marathon is held by IrishmanThomas Maguire, who ran the race in three hours and 36 minutes in 2007. The Arctic iswarmingat twice the rate of the rest of the globe. As the climate crisis deepens, scientistsexpectthat within fewer than three decades, sea ice cover will completely disappear in the summer months unless global emissions can be significantly reduced—and quickly. And because what happens at the North Poleimpactsthe entire Earth, the seasonal disappearance of ice will likely lead to rising sea levels, more severe weather events, and drastic changes in climate and precipitation on all seven continents."

AsThe New York Timesreports, Khao Yai National Park in central Thailand responded to a recent littering offense by mailing abandoned trash back to the litterbugs who left it there. The responsible party left behind a tent filled with trash after camping overnight in Khao Yai. In Thailand, littering in a national park is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $16,000 fine. The park officials took a less conventional approach to this particular crime. After cross-referencing equipment rental forms with a discarded prescription bottle, they were able to track down the offenders and mail them their forgotten garbage. The clear bag of trash came with a note. “You have forgotten some of your belongings at the Khao Yai National Park,” it read. “Please let us return these to you.” Varawut Silpa-archa, Thailand's environment minister, referenced the incident in aFacebook post, writing, “I will pick up every single piece of your trash, pack them well in a box, and mail it to your home as a souvenir."" In addition to getting a package of trash in the mail, the unidentified campers have also been banned from staying in the park overnight. Officials tasked with protecting the environment have seen firsthand the damage litter can cause. Plastics can takecenturiesto break down, and in that time they pose a serious threat to wildlife.

They’re called ice volcanoes, or ice canos, and they’re nature’s mostly harmless re-imagining of a volcano. You can see this atypical formation in Kazakhstan, whichreportedlycrops up every January and looks like a place for Frodo to drop a ring into, in the video below. An ice cano needs some very specific conditions in order to appear. Tom Finley, director of education at Schlitz Audubon Nature Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,toldThe Washington Postthat freezing temperatures (32 degrees Fahrenheit) need to be persistent. That chill coupled with strong winds will cause ice to form. The water continuing to move underneath will eventually break through the ice—known as an ice shelf—and then freeze. As more water exits, the ice volcano grows. The formations, which can grow larger than a person, look “like a completely foreign landscape,” Finley said, with observers feeling “like you have been transported to another planet.” The ice canos dotting Lake Michigan are numerous but not terribly large; the ice cano in Kazakhstan exceeds 45 feet in height. The emerging water from the top looks like a geyser, giving it all a school science fair feel. Because ice volcanoes rest on unstable ice shelves, it’s not a good idea to examine one up close. Finleyrecommendsgoing in a group, using walking poles and cleats, and being aware of frostbite. [h/tTravel Awaits]"

They weren’t exactly staging an organized protest—they were justbeaversdoing what beavers do. Nevertheless, officials at the Idaho Department of Fish and Game decided their best bet was to find a new home for the long-toothed locals. The surrounding wilderness provided plenty of options, but transportation was another issue entirely. Traversing the undeveloped, mountainous terrain would require both trucks and pack animals, and experts knew from past relocation efforts that beavers weren’t fond of either. “Beavers cannot stand the direct heat of the sun unless they are in water,” department employee Elmo W. Heter explained in a 1950 report [PDF]. “Sometimes they refuse to eat. Older individuals often become dangerously belligerent ... Horses and mules become spooky and quarrelsome when loaded with a struggling, malodorous pair of live beavers.” To keep Payette Lake’s beavers healthy and happy during the journey, their human handlers would need to find another method of travel. As Boise State Public Radioreports, that’s when Heter suggested making use of their leftover WWII parachutes. Two beavers would sit inside a wooden box attached to a parachute, which could be dropped from an airplane between 500 and 800 feet above their new home in the Chamberlain Basin. The cables that fastened the box to the parachute would keep it shut during the flight, but they’d slacken enough for the beavers to open the box upon landing. After testing the operation with weights, Heter and his colleagues enlisted an older beaver named Geronimo for a few live trials. “Poor fellow!” Heter wrote. “You may be sure that ‘Geronimo’ had a priority reservation on the first ship into the hinterland, and that three young females went with him.” Once Geronimo had certified the safety of the mission, the team began migrating the whole beaver population. During the fall of 1948, a total of 76 beavers touched down in their new territory. It wasn’t without tragedy, though; one beaver fell to his death after a cable broke on his box. Overall, however, the venture was deemed much safer (and less expensive) than any trip on foot would have been. And when department officials checked in on the beavers a year later, they had already startedimprovingtheir ecosystem. “Beavers had built dams, constructed houses, stored up food, and were well on their way to producing colonies,” Heter wrote.

And if you're a coffee drinker, you probably know that the disposable paper filters you use every day to brew your favorite beans can cause unnecessary waste that just continues to grow over time. If you want to avoid making the switch to a plastic, reusable model,ReFlow’s cotton coffee filtersand tea bags are an eco-friendly alternative that makes morning brews as sustainable as possible—and you can support them onKickstarteruntil January 16. Paper coffee filters contribute to deforestation, mountains of waste, needless plastic packaging, and oftentimes go through achemical processinvolving chlorine to get that bright white look. The recycled cotton ReFlow filters result in coffee that tastes the same as a cup brewed with a paper filter, but you'll be able to reuse it hundreds of times. The filters are also suitable whether you're using a pour-over coffee method or have a brewing machine. For the tea lovers out there, you can fill the ReFlow Pouch with all different kinds of tea leaves to get the best flavor without tossing a dozen soggy paper bags in the trash every week. And both products can be thrown in the wash in between uses. There are many ways to support this campaign: When you contribute at least $25, you’ll get either two reusable coffee filters or tea bags. Contributing at least $43 will get you two coffee filtersandtwo tea bags. When you contribute $55, you’ll get either four coffee filters or four tea bags. Higher contributions yield more rewards, like coffee drippers and a barista towel made from recycled fabric. The ReFlow campaign ends on January 16, so there is still time for you to support this product by heading toKickstarter. Shipments will hopefully be sent out in February 2021."

In order to save the planet from the progressively devastating effects of climate change and habitat loss, that number will have to be a lot higher—around 50 percent, according to a new analysispublishedinScience Advances. Researchers from RESOLVE, the University of Minnesota, Arizona State University, and Globaïa spent the past two years pinpointing a “Global Safety Net” of the most important regions we must preserve not only to slowclimate change, but also to safeguard Earth’s plant and animal species. They split lands into five categories—species rarity sites, high biodiversity areas, large mammal landscapes, intact wilderness areas, and climate stabilization areas—and created an interactive,color-coded mapvia Google Earth Engine so you can explore them for yourself. The light blue expanses are climate stabilization areas, which are particularly well-equipped to store carbon. Since humans emit such large quantities of carbon by burning fossil fuels, it’s pivotal that wefortifyforests, grasslands, and other terrain that can soak it up before it contributes toglobal warming. (And, of course, we also need to work onreducingour carbon emissions in the first place.) High biodiversity areas and rare species sites are dark green and pink, respectively. While protecting Earth’s fascinating flora and fauna is an end goal on its own, there’s another reason why we should keep these ecosystems intact. As humans encroach upon habitats and essentially evict their occupants, we’re increasing our chances of being exposed to new germs. If more diseases make the jump from animals to humans—calledzoonotic diseases—it could lead to morepandemics. The Global Safety Net isn’t only for personal perusal. AsFast Companyreports, the researchers are hoping that governments across the globe will use the data to inform future conservation legislation. “We now have a detailed global map to help guide policy in restoring humanity's relationship with nature,” Google Earth Engine program managerTanya Birchsaid in apress release. “By leveraging advanced computer technologies, the Global Safety Net offers an actionable and dynamic roadmap for saving our planet.

As Engadgetreports, electronics company LG will soon debut a solution: the PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier, a face mask that ensures every breath of air is a fresh one. The mask doesn’t just clean the air—it’s also designed to make breathing as easy as it is when you aren’t wearing a mask. The respiratory sensor tracks how fast you’re breathing and how much air you’re taking in, and the three-speed fans adjust their own pace accordingly. They spin faster when you inhale in order to deliver more air, and they decelerate when you exhale so you’re not struggling against the force of a fan every time you breathe out. According to apress release, designers used “extensive facial shape analysis” to develop a mask that’s comfortable enough to wear for hours, but tight enough that it won’t let impure air sneak in through small gaps. Each charge will last you about eight hours in low mode and two hours in high mode, though LG hasn’t yet detailed the differences between the two settings.

Searing heat can torture human occupants. After dark, the problem is reversed, and a winter jacket might prove useful. On average, temperatures in Africa's Sahara Desert can swing an astounding 75 degrees in 24 hours, rising to an average 100°F with the sun out and plummeting to 25°F after it sets. What causes this? Blame the sand. When the sun is out, sand proves to be an effective distributor of heat,reflectingit back into the air. But it’s not very good at retaining heat. Once the sun goes down, heat from the sand is released quickly. The thing that could help retain warm air overnight is humidity, but deserts don’t have much of that. Water vapor in the air traps heat: Think of it like aninsulatingblanket, preventing either heat or cold from dispersing into the air. When the heat source is taken away, that vapor will retain it for long periods. Without sun or humidity, daytime heat isn’t being held anywhere, and the desert will cool rapidly. Humidity is also why deserts can feel hotter than other places even though the temperature is the same. The water vapor needs lots of solar energy to heat up, while a dry climate takes that energy head-on. All of this happens quickly because of that lack of humidity. Just as warm air escapes when night falls, there’s no humidity to trap the chilly evening weather. When the sun rises, it’s back to scorching. Other factors can come into play. Clouds that helpmoderatetemperature and wind can both help keep temperatures from dropping.

South Georgia sits in the South Atlantic north of Antarctica and east of South America, and in recent years, it's become a great place to studyking penguinsand their impact on the environment. As glaciers on the island have retreated due to climate change, an influx of penguins has filled the newly open land. The island supports a king penguin population of about 300,000 breeding adults today. The uptick in penguins has resulted in more penguinpoop, with the poop releasing more of the same greenhouse gases into the air that are causing glaciers to the melt in the first place. The environment isn't the only thing susceptible to the gases from penguin guano. Scientists from Denmark and China were in South Georgia to study this cycle when they started to feel sick and loopy. They had spent the day breathing nitrous oxide, which is more commonly known as laughing gas. “After nosing about in guano for several hours, one goes completely cuckoo. One begins to feel ill and get a headache,” Bo Elberling, a researcher from the Center for Permafrost at the University of Copenhagen,told the AFP. He and his colleagues published a study on the relationship between glacial retreat, penguin activity, and greenhouses gases in the journalScience of The Total Environment. King penguins eat a lot of fish and krill, both of which are high in nitrogen. But penguin feces on its own doesn't contain the same stuff that dentists give their patients. When the guano enters the ground,microbesin the soil convert it to nitrous oxide. In addition to making it hard for visitors to breath, the gas is bad for the air. The polluting effect of nitrous oxide is 300 times higher than that of carbon dioxide. According to the study, there isn't enough nitrous oxide produced on South Georgia to have a global impact, but as the penguin population grows, so will the amount of waste they leave behind.

FARTS,” Frank Mitloehner, a professor at the University of California Davis Department of Animal Sciencewroteon Twitter. “Nearly all enteric methane from cattle is from belching.

The research, which wasconductedby the Autonomous University of the State of Mexico, has not been published. Critics point out that the reduced emissions are only during the last three to four months of a cow’s life, leaving the remainder—up to 24 months total—to produce typical amounts of gas.

While it might seem like a drastic policy, Vermont has been laying the groundwork—and developing the infrastructure to maintain it—for years. In 2012, the legislature unanimously passed the Universal Recycling Law, which mapped out a step-by-step plan to cut down on landfill waste. Over the years,recyclables, yard debris, and now food scraps have all been banned from landfills [PDF]. To help residents abide by the restrictions, trash haulers have begun to offer pick-up services for the entire range of materials, and the state has budgeted around $970,000 in grant money for compost collection and processing facilities. According toFast Company, Vermont officials are hopeful this latest policy will help them hit their long-standing goal of reducing landfill waste by 50 percent; until now, they’ve only been able to achieve a 36-percent decrease. And it’s not just about saving space in landfills. Food decomposes more slowly in landfills, and the process produces methane—a harmful greenhouse gas that contributes toclimate change. Composting those scraps enriches the soil (and keeps garbage from smelling so putrid, too). As for enforcing the Food Scraps Ban, they’re relying on the honor code. “People say, ‘What does this mean with a food waste ban? [Are] people going to be out there looking in my garbage for my apple cores?'” Josh Kelly, materials management section chief at the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, toldFast Company. “That’s not the intent of this.” The lack of consequences might diminish the efficacy of such a law in a different state, but maybe not in eco-friendly Vermont:According toa University of Vermont study, 72 percent of Vermonters already composted or fed food scraps to their animals before the Food Scraps Ban took effect.

Last November, for example, temperatures dropped more than 50 degrees below 0°F. Verkhoyansk does thaw out considerably during the summer months, but its June averages usually hover around 68°F, which is still considerably cooler than what residents have been experiencing for the last few days (and will continue to experience for a week or more). This recent heat wave is the result of what meteorologists call a “heat dome,” which is when a ridge of high pressure in the atmosphere settles over an area and prevents hot air from rising and dispersing, instead forcing it back to the surface where it causes abnormally hot temperatures. But the strangely high thermometer readings aren’t limited to one town or one weather pattern. Western Siberia as a whole has been averaging noticeably warmer temperatures since December, and the extended slew of scorchers is damaging more than just its reputation as one of thecoldest regionson Earth.

Of that gigantic number, however, only about 100,000 are intense enough for humans to feel the effects, and just 100 or so of those actually cause any destruction. In other words, the Earth quakes a lot, whether we realize it or not. So why do earthquakes happen, when do they happen, and can you avoid them by moving to themoon? Those questions and more, addressed below. Understanding earthquakes requires a brief journey to the center of the Earth, which is a solid ball of iron and other metals that can reach temperatures up to 10,800°F. The extreme heat from thatinner coreemanates through its surrounding layers—first through the outer core, mostly made of liquid iron and nickel, and then on to the mostly solid rock layer called the mantle. This heating process causes constant movement in themantle, which makes the Earth’s crust above it move, too. The crust comprises a patchwork of giant, individual rock slabs called tectonic plates. Sometimes when two plates areslidingagainst each other, the friction between their jagged edges causes them to temporarily get stuck. The pressure builds until it can finally overcome the friction, and the plates finally go their separate ways. At that point, all the pent-up energy is released in ripples—or seismic waves—that literally shake the land sitting on the Earth’s crust. Unfortunately, there’s no fancy device that warns us whenever an earthquake is coming. But while scientists can’tpredictexactly when or where an earthquake will occur, they can occasionallyforecastthe probability that one will hit a certain area sometime soon (and if that sounds a little vague, it’s because it is). For one, we know where the tectonic plates border each other, and that’s where the high-magnitude earthquakes occur. TheRing of Fire, for example, is an area along the rim of the Pacific Ocean where approximately 81 percent of the world’s biggest earthquakes happen. We also know that especially large earthquakes are sometimes preceded by tiny quakes called foreshocks (though they can’t beidentifiedas foreshocks unless a larger earthquake actually hits—if that doesn’t happen, they’re just regular, small earthquakes). When small quakes near a plate boundary coincide with other geological changes, it can indicate that a big earthquake is coming. In February 1975, for instance, the Chinese city ofHaichengexperienced possible foreshocks after months of shifts in land elevation and water levels, so officials ordered its million residents to evacuate immediately. The next day, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake rocked the region. Though there were 2000 casualties, it’s estimated that 150,000 could have been killed or injured if nobody had fled. That said, successful forecasts like Haicheng’s are rare, and scientists spend a lot of time monitoring known fault lines—the borders between plates—to try to determine how much pressure is building up and when it might cause a problem. It’s not an exact science. One fluctuating forecast is for “The Big One,” a huge earthquake that’s expected to hit the San Andreas Fault Zone, an 800-mile network of fault lines that runs from Northern to Southern California, sometime in the future. Right now, the USGSforecastsa 31 percent chance that a 7.5-magnitude quake will hit Los Angeles in the next 30 years and a 20 percent chance that such a quake will occur in San Francisco’s Bay Area. The likelihood of “The Big One” is partially dependent on other earthquakes in that fault zone. After two back-to-back quakes hit Ridgecrest, California, in 2019, seismologists observed pressure changes in the surrounding fault lines, and astudypublished in July 2020 suggested that the chances of “The Big One” happening in the next year may have increased to 1.15 percent—three to five times likelier than previously thought. Because so much of Earth’s surface is covered in water, many earthquakes don’t touch land at all, but that doesn’t mean they don’t affect people. When platesshifton the ocean floor, the energy displaces the water above them, causing it to rise dramatically. Then, gravity pulls that water back down, which makes the surrounding water form a massive wave, ortsunami. Earthquakes can also indirectly cause tsunamis by altering the landscape. On July 9, 1958, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake hitLituya Bayin northeastern Alaska, causing a rockslide on a bordering cliff. As an estimated 40 million cubic yards of rock rushed into the bay, the force created an estimated 1720-foot wave—the largest tsunami of all time. The boundary between the North American and Pacific plates runs through and around Alaska, which means that Alaskans are no strangers to earthquakes;according tothe Alaska Earthquake Center, one is detected in the state about every 15 minutes. On March 28, 1964, a 9.2-magnitude earthquake—the largest ever recorded in the U.S.—hit Prince William Sound, a body of water that borders the Gulf of Alaska. Not only did the initial force level buildings and homes, but it alsogenerateda series of landslides, tsunamis, and other earthquakes (called aftershocks) that affected communities as far as Oregon and California. Scientistsdiscoveredthat the earthquake had happened because the Pacific plate wasn’t just rubbing up against the North American plate—it was actually slipping under it. The area where these plates converge is known as a “subduction zone.” Occasionally, the pressure builds up and causes a major movement, or megathrust, when it finally releases. Though experts still couldn't predict these movements, studying the damage did help Alaskans shore up their defenses for future earthquakes. Officials passed better building codes, and the town ofValdez, which sat on unstable land, was actually moved four miles east. The 1960earthquakenear Valdivia, Chile, was larger than Alaska’s earthquake four years later, but the conditions that caused it were similar. The Nazca plate, which runs beneath the Pacific Ocean along South America’s west coast, is slipping under the South American plate (which is beneath the continent itself). On May 22, 1960, there was a huge shift along a 560- to 620-mile length of the Nazca plate, causing a catastrophic, record-breaking earthquake with a magnitude of 9.5. Just like in Alaska, this quake set off a series of tsunamis and aftershocks that decimated whole towns. It’s difficult to quantify the damage, but it’s estimated that at least 1655 people died and another 2 million people ended up homeless. Approximately 800 years ago, anearthquakenear Dunedin, New Zealand, thrust a section of its coast upward and wiped out the bull kelp that had lived there. New bull kelp soon started settling in the area, and their descendants today look indistinguishable from the neighboring kelp that never got displaced. In July 2020, scientists published astudyin the journalProceedings of the Royal Society Bshowing that the two kelp populations actually have different genetic makeup. Their findings suggest that earthquakes—and similar geological catastrophes—can have an extremely long-lasting impact on the biodiversity of the affected area. In 1935, Charles Richterdeviseda scale for determining an earthquake’s magnitude by measuring the size of its seismic waves with a seismograph. Basically, aseismographis an instrument with a mass attached to a fixed base; the base moves during an earthquake, while the mass does not. The movement is converted into an electrical voltage, which is recorded by a moving needle onto paper in a wave pattern. The varying height of the waves is called amplitude. The higher the amplitude, the higher an earthquake scores on the Richter scale (which goes from one to 10). Since the scale is logarithmic, each point is 10 times greater than the one below it. But seismic wave amplitude in one specific area is alimited metric, especially for larger earthquakes that affect pretty vast regions. So, in the 1970s, seismologists Hiroo Kanamori and Thomas C. Hankscame upwith a measurement called a “moment,” found by multiplying threevariables: distance the plates moved; length of the fault line between them; and rigidity of the rock itself. That moment is essentially how much energy is released in an earthquake, which is a more comprehensive metric than just how much the ground shakes. To put it in terms the general public could grasp, they created the moment magnitude scale, where the moment is converted to a number value between one and 10. The values increase logarithmically, just like they do on the Richter scale, so it’s not uncommon for newscasters or journalists to mistakenly mention the Richter scale when they’re actually talking about the moment magnitude scale. Aptly called moonquakes, these seismic shifts can happen for a fewreasons(that we know of so far). Deep moonquakes are usually because Earth’s gravitational pull is manipulating the moon’s interior structures. A surface-level quake, on the other hand, is sometimes the result of a meteoroid impact or the stark temperature change between night and day. But in May 2019, scientistssuggesteda possible fourth reason for shallower shakes: The moon is shrinking as its core cools, and this process is causing shifts in its crust. As the crust shifts, the scarps—or ridges—that we see on the moon’s surface may shift, too."

But in urban settings, the intrusive noise of traffic, construction, or other interruptions can dampen a park's pleasures. Near Taipei, Taiwan, visitors toYangmingshan National Parkhave a different experience entirely. According toCondé Nast Traveler, the park will be certified this week by Taiwan’s government and the California-based nonprofit Quiet Parks International as the first-ever Quiet Urban Park. With densely-populated Taipei two hours away, the background noise doesn’t exceed 45 decibels, or roughly the level of a quiet conversation. The park’s location will allow people to experience the noise of their surroundings, fromfrogstobirds. In the early morning hours, when activity in Taipei is minimal,duckscan be heard paddling across the water. In this setting, the hope is that people living in the bustle of urban life can have a place to decompress. According to Laila Chin-Hui Fan, the environmental journalist who led the movement to get Yangmingshan approved, the site is a “wonderland that can help cleanse our body, clear our mind, and claim our spirit.” Quiet Parks International is hoping to certify as many as 50 more parks in the coming decade, including locations in New York City, London, Stockholm, and Portland, Oregon. Yangmingshan National Park will officially be recognized June 5, and so will a mile-long path through the woods that QPI has dubbed an official Quiet Urban Trail.

129,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/624623/tips-watching-backyard-wildlife,,"Whether you live among acres of sprawling land or look out over a sliver of city sidewalk, if you pay close enough attention, you’re bound to see wildlife right outside your door. So get familiar with your nonhuman neighbors with these 10 tips for backyard wildlife watching. After all, theanimalsare there—whether you notice them or not. Watching wildlifeis a wonderful way to learn about the other inhabitants of your yard. “You can go out and go for a hike and walk to find something, but there’s really a value in sitting quietly in one space and seeing what comes along,” Brian Hess, a wildlife biologist with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, told Mental Floss in 2020. Charismatic creatures like deer and bears are exciting, but there’s no need to wait for something large to come ambling through. Peek between the branches of a shrub and you may find a bird nest tucked within the greenery; move a rock and you’ll likely spot worms wriggling around in the moist earth. Try varying your routine, too, as different animals become more active depending on the time of day. Treat wildlife watching as if you’re window shopping in a store stocked with stuff you can’t afford: Basically, look but don’t touch. “My general rule of thumb whenever I’m watching wildlife is if they change their behavior because of my presence, that probably means I’m too close and should back off,” Hess said. Keeping your distance will help both you and the wildlife stay safe—and make sure any curious pets don’t get too close to wild creatures, either. An animal may attack if it feels threatened, which, as anyone who’s seenHomeward Bound(1993) knows, can lead to some pretty painful encounters. There’s also the risk ofzoonotic diseases; though fairly rare, North Americans in particular have to be cautious ofrabies. Avoid feeding wildlife, too (bird feeders are fine—more on that later). Don’t chuck your dog’s uneaten kibble or your dinner scraps out the back door, as teaching wildlife to rely on people for meals can cause unwanted learned behavior and lead to human-animal conflicts. One of the best ways to attract wildlife is to addnative plantsto your yard. “You can put an oak tree in your yard, watch the life come to it, and help rebuild your local ecosystem,” Doug Tallamy, a professor of entomology at the University of Delaware, told Mental Floss in 2020. A perfectly manicured patch of grass or an exotic shrub may look lovely, but it doesn’t create a suitable habitat for many animals. Mostinsectsare specialized feeders, meaning they’ve evolved over millions of years to eat particular plants. Basically, if you want to see moremonarchs, you better start planting some milkweed. Short on yard space? Urban apartment dwellers can stick pots of native plants in window boxes. Adding even a tiny bit of greenery will help city animals who may not have access to as many resources as their rural counterparts. Finding native plants is fairly simple. Organizations like theNational Wildlife Federationand theAudubon Society(and if you’re in California, theCalifornia Native Plant Society) have online databases you can browse. And, if you’re attracting birds, avoid turning your yard into a stage for Windex commercial-level crashes. If your glass is spotless, stick some decals or tempera paint onto your windowsto help prevent bird collisions. Though native plants are a great way to attract wildlife, you can also supplement your yard’s offerings with various bird feeders [PDF]. Make sure you regularly clean your feeders, lest the seeds get wet and grow mold. You should also rake away any discarded shells scattered on the ground, which cancollectharmful bacteria. If you live in an area with bears, check with your state’s wildlife agency for theirseasonal best practicesregarding bird feeders, as foragingursineslove to snack on high-fat, high-protein seeds. Atub of waterin a shady spot away from your house will help your resident critters and thirsty passersby. If you can, put a large rock or brick in the water bowl, and fill the basin so only part of the object is submerged. This will provide insects and other animals with an extra perch to land on, as they may have a tough time sipping water from a steep-sided dog dish. The rock will also give small creatures an extra escape option, should they accidentally fall into the tub and go for an unplanned swim. Make sure you clean the water bowl regularly—standing water can quickly become a soupy mess of dirt, guano, andmosquitoeggs. Put away the insecticide and instead embrace your resident creepy-crawlies. You can have a lot of funidentifyingthe beetles and butterflies that frequent your yard. And about90 percentof flowering plants depend onpollinators, so not only is that bee bumbling around your garden cute, it’s also playing a vital role in helping your local ecosystem. While insects are fascinating in their own right, you can also view them as food for larger creatures. They’re a nutritious meal for animals like birds, lizards, frogs, squirrels, bats, opossums, and much more. Caterpillars in particular are a great source of grub for local and migrant bird populations. “If you want chickadees breeding in your yard, you need to have 6000 to 9000 caterpillars or the chickadees can’t rear their young,” Tallamy told Mental Floss. There’s a reason avid birders get to know their bird calls. “Hearing wildlife is a great way to start to pay attention,” John Rowden, senior director of bird-friendly communities at the Audubon Society, told Mental Floss in 2020. “Learn the sounds, and it will help you identify the animals.” And if your yard suddenly erupts with a cacophony ofsquirrel alarm calls, there’s a good chance there’s some sort of predator lurking nearby. Identifying the sounds of nocturnal animals likeowlsand raccoons will help you discern who's been coming after dark. You may be able to smell some animals, too.Skunksunleash a notoriously stinky spray when warding off threats;foxesandmountain lionsmark their territories with their own funky scents; and desert dwellers claim they can often smelljavelinabefore they see them. You don’t have to see the animals themselves to find hints of their presence. A fallen feather, a muddyprint, a well-walked trail etched into the dirt, and a heaping pile ofscatare all clues as to who’s been sharing your yard. Sure, watching wildlife is a great excuse to unplug, but embracingtools and technologycan help enhance your experience. A pair of binoculars will transform that blurry blot in the sky into a clearly identifiable bird; a trail camera will snap footage of whatever walks through your yard when you’re not looking. Apps likeiNaturalistandMerlincan help you identify various species and share your findings with fellow members of the community. Keep a record of the creatures who frequent your yard. This will help you get a sense of their routines and better identify individual animals. You can keep your logs simple—a quick journal entry or a series of photographs is an excellent way to document your resident wildlife. As a bonus, your observations can also help withcitizen scienceprojects, such as theMonarch Joint Ventureor Audubon’sHummingbirds at Homeproject.

AsSmithsonianreports, evidence of pollution from the incident has been found in an unusual place: Paris's beehives. A new study published in the journalEnvironmental Science & Technology Lettersexplains that hives located downwind from the Notre-Dame fire contained honey with high concentrations of lead. As the cathedral's roof andspireburned, 450 tons of lead melted in the extreme heat, releasing hazardous particles into the air. While lead had clearly settled into the structure itself—making it unsafe toreopento the public even after it was renovated—the question remains of how far the toxic materials spread beyond the site. The study shows that at least some lead managed to travel a few miles away from the church. Honey sampled three months after the blaze from hives downwind from the Notre-Dame fire contained four times as much lead as honey from the Parisian suburbs, and 3.5 times as much as Parisian honey collected before April 2019. This doesn't mean that honey from certain Paris neighborhoods is unsafe to eat. The sample with the highest numbers, taken from a hive 3 miles west of the cathedral, contained 0.08 micrograms of lead per 1 gram of honey. The European Union allows honey to be sold with lead concentrations up to 0.10 micrograms per gram. “The highest levels of lead that we detected were the equivalent of 80 drops of water in an Olympic sized swimming pool,” study co-author Dominique Weis, director of the University of British Columbia's Pacific Centre for Isotopic and Geochemical Research, said in astatement. But what the findings mean for homes and businesses in Notre-Dame's surrounding area-where environmental lead samples have exceeded the safety guidelines20 timesover in some spots—is still unclear.

Embedded deep inside an Arctic mountain, it holds roughly1 millionseed samples that can be accessed only in emergencies. But its remote location can't protect it from one of its biggest threats: rising temperatures above the Arctic Circle. AsLife in Norwayreports, the Svalbard archipelago recorded its hottest day ever on July 25, 2020, when temperatures exceeded 71°F. It beat the long-standing record of 70.3°F., which was logged in 1979. The islands lie about 700 miles south of the North Pole. A rapidlychanging climatecould spell disaster for the seed vault. The vault acts as a reserve for the world's crops. If a catastrophe—such as war or famine—wipes out a specificplantspecies, the facility ensures it isn't lost for good. The resource was used as intended for the first time in 2015 in light of theSyrian civil war. But if the vault itself is vulnerable to destruction, then it can't fulfill its mission. Unusually warm weather in the Arctic threatens to melt the permafrost that's stayed frozen beneath the surface for centuries. When this happened in Svalbard in2016, the underground facility flooded. Thankfully no seed samples were damaged in the event. The seed vault has beenrenovatedsince the flood, but the latest temperature record shows that climate change is still a problem for the site. As temperatures rise around the world, the vault's function becomes more than important than ever; climate change is one of the catastrophes facing the same crops the Svalbard Seed Vault was built to protect.

Both docs are produced by and airing on National Geographic. InLost on Everest, premiering at 9 p.m. EDT, climber Mark Synnott and Nat Geo photographer Renan Ozturk lead a team of seasoned mountaineers on a mission to discover what happened to Andrew “Sandy” Irvine, who vanished with fellow explorer George Mallory during the first Everest climb in June 1924. While Mallory’s body was located by a BBC-sponsored operation in 1999, Irvine’s exact fate has remained a mystery for nearly a century since his disappearance. As Synnott and his companions search for evidence, they encounter their own harrowing set of obstacles, from hurricane-force winds to medical emergencies. But Mount Everest isn’t only achallengefor adventure-seekers and intrepid investigators—it also holds thousands of years’ worth of information about how climate change has altered the environment, which can help scientists predict its future effects. InExpedition Everest, airing at 10 p.m. EDT, actor Tate Donovan narrates the journey of an international group of scientists and climbers with an ambitious set of data-collecting objectives. One task is to use drones, laser scanners, and cameras to capture footage of every inch of the ascent, so researchers can create a 360-degree portrait of the mountain and track how glacial melt alters the landscape in the coming years. Since the Himalayas contain the water supply for roughly one-fourth of the world’s population, the increase in glacial melt—which has already doubled since 2000—could threaten the futures of billions of people living in the region. Even more immediate is the risk of flash floods, which are difficult to predict without a constant feed of weather data from high altitudes. Another goal of the expedition is to install weather stations at five locations along the climbing route, which will monitor temperature, humidity, air pressure, wind speed, and other factors that help alert meteorologists to an impending flood. Never before has an ice core been collected from this height on Everest, but scientists brave dangerous, and even deadly, conditions to try and collect a sample.#ExpeditionEverestpic.twitter.com/namhdff6WN Some researchers have joined the expedition to drill deep into the ice at an altitude above 8000 meters (26,000 feet)—Mount Everest's ""death zone""—and collect ice cores. These long tubes of ice reveal how the atmosphere has changed over thousands of years. Others are collecting similar cores of sediment at the bottom of a lake, as well as examining how plant and animal life has adapted to the warming temperatures and rising water levels. Overall,Expedition Everestillustrates how the Himalayas function as an early indicator of what climate change will do to other places.

Now, they’ve finally got one in their grasp. As CBS Newsreports, the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) found the hornet on July 14 in a bottle trap set near Whatcom County’s Birch Bay. It’s the only trapped specimen so far; Washington’s previous five sightings were all free-roaming. “This is encouraging because it means we know that the traps work,” Sven Spichiger, WSDA’s managing entomologist, said in apress release. “But it also means we have work to do.” Right now, the captured hornet’s colony is likely abuzz with just one queen and some worker hornets, but that’ll change after mating season begins in mid-September. New queens and other hornets will be born, and the growing community will soon wreak havoc on the area—especially its honeybees. Murder hornets target beehives, beheading thebeesand feeding the leftover thoraxes to their young. To keep the species from decimating the state’s bee population (not to mention stinging unsuspecting humans), it’s imperative that the WSDA locate the hornets’ hives and destroy them within the next two months.

135,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/627260/beavers-return-to-devon-england-river-otter,,"Beavers were hunted to extinction in England in the16th century, so locals were surprised to find a group of the mammals living on Devon's River Otter in 2008. Instead of moving the beavers, the Devon Wildlife Trust monitored the population to see how it would interact with the local environment. Now, asThe Guardianreports, the government has deemed the beaver reintroduction program a success, meaning the species now has a permanent home in the country for the first time in centuries. Though the North American beaver is better known,beaversare also native to Europe.Huntingreduced theEurasian Beaverpopulation to 1200 specimens by 1900. Their numbers have recovered in the years since, but they're still mainly limited to Scandinavia, Germany, France, Poland, and central Russia. The beaver group currently living on the River Otter likely originated with either an accidental or unauthorized release. When local authorities discovered the beavers were breeding in 2014, they intended to relocate them to protect the local ecosystem. TheDevon Wildlife Trustproposed an alternative: Allow the population to live on the river undisturbed for five years, and only remove them if they were proven to cause harm by the end of the trial. The beavers did not hurt the environment—they actually addedseveral benefits, according to the five-year study. The population, which now consists of 15 family groups, constructed 28 dams throughout the river system. These dams helped slow water flow during floods and contained water during droughts that would normally dry up riverbeds. The beaver-engineered habitat also allowed an increase in the number ofwater voles, fish, and amphibians. When the trial officially ends on August 31, the beavers will become permanent residents of Devon in the eyes of the government. They're concentrated on the River Otter for now, but they're expected to expand beyond it, potentially starting new beaver populations in other parts of England for the first time in modern history.

The current world record for the hottest temperature recorded on Earth was 134°F and was set by Death Valley back on July 10, 1913. A scorching 131°F was also observed in Kebili, Tunisia, on July 7, 1931. Because some meteorologists believe these two readings may not have been totally accurate, it’s possible the 129°F observed in Death Valley in 2013 and the 129°F recorded in both Kuwait in 2016 and Pakistan in 2017 could be the current highest temperatures. If so, and if the latest temperature can be verified, that would make it the new record holder by one degree. While Death Valley is known for its blistering heat, much of the Western United States has seen sweltering temperatures this month. Phoenix, Arizona, recorded 117°F; Sacramento, California, recorded 112°F. While these temperatures are undoubtedly impressive, they’re still not quite enough to attempt to fry an egg on a sidewalk. Egg yolks usuallyneedat least 150°F in order to cook, and concrete is a rather poor heat conductor. [h/tThe Washington Post]"

AsCNN Travelreports, the species recently popped up in a noteworthy place: Scientists have spotted a family of three wolverines in Mount Rainier National Park, marking the animal's first appearance there in more than 100 years. A member of the weasel family, wolverines were once prized for their fur and hunted to near-extinction in the 19th and early20th centuries. Their numbers have rebounded slightly, but today there are only 300 to 1000 specimens in the lower 48 states. In addition to their small population, wolverines are notoriously elusive, which makes it hard for scientists to study them. The Mount Rainier wolverines were discovered by theCascades Carnivore Projectin partnership with the National Park Service. In 2018, scientists installed remote cameras designed to detect wolverines' distinctive chest markings in the park. This summer, the camera stations recorded a nursing wolverine and her two kits—Rainier's first wolverine family in a century. Park officials are hopeful that more wolverines will follow this initial sighting. Wolverines require a large hunting range and are sensitive to environmental changes, so their presence in Rainier speaks to the ecological health of the park as a whole. The location of the den hasn't been made public for the animals' protection, but park officials say visitors should keep an eye out for them. “Backcountry enthusiasts, skiers, snowshoers, and snowmobilers can help us monitor wolverines and contribute to studying their natural return to the Cascade ecosystem,” Dr. Tara Chestnut, a park ecologist, said in apress release. “Wolverines are solitary animals and despite their reputation for aggressiveness in popular media, they pose no risk to park visitors. If you are lucky enough to see one in the wild, it will likely flee as soon as it notices you.” [h/tCNN Travel]"

AsBoston.comreports, a bald eagle nest with a baby chick has been spotted on the Cape for the first time in more than a century. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife spotted the nest in Barnstable, Massachusetts. It's one of more than 70 eagle's nests that have popped up around the state this year, with others being documenting in Concord, Medford, and Northampton. Any eagle nest with eggs is considered active, and accordingto a photosnapped by a Mass Audubon Long Pasture volunteer, the Cape Cod site has already hatched a chick. A bald eagle nest with eggs was last recorded on Cape Cod in 1905. In the years that followed, hunting, habitat loss, and insecticides like DDT decimated their numbers, resulting in the birds' addition to the Endangered Species List. Thanks to conservation efforts and the ban of DDT, this trend has been reversed. Their numbers have grown from to just471 nesting pairsin the lower 48 states in 1963 to nearly 10,000 today. The species is no longer considered endangered, and as the new Cape Cod nest shows, the birds are beginning to show up in places they haven't been seen in a lifetime.

AsAccuWeatherreports, the group of 17-year cicadas dubbed Brood IX is already starting to emerge in northwestern North Carolina, southwestern Virginia, and southeastern West Virginia. As their name suggests, 17-cicadas appear above ground onceevery 17 years. Most of their lives are spent as nymphs in the dirt, sucking sap fromtree roots. When the weather warms up in their 17th year, that's their cue to breach the surface, climb a tree or some other vertical surface, and shed their immature exoskeletons. The large, dark bug that emerges is the cicada most people are familiar with. After a few months of flying, mating, and filling the forest with their deafening songs, the adult cicadas die by the end of the summer. That's the scene that's set to play out in a small pocket of the eastern U.S. in the coming weeks. Different cicada broods follow different timelines, and 2020 is the year the newest generation of Brood IX makes its debut. The group is estimated to comprise nearly1.5 millioninsects. When the soil warms up to 64° F, the first of the bugs will make their ascent. The ground typically reaches that point in mid-May, but due to recent cold weather in the mid-Atlantic, the cicadas may arrive to the party later than usual.

As part of Black Birders Week, you can follow along as professional and amateur Black naturalists, scientists, and outdoor enthusiasts share their expertise and experiences and celebrate diversity in the outdoors. Throughout the week, members of BlackAFInSTEM are facilitating online events and conversations like#AskABlackBirderand#BlackWomenWhoBird. Though Black Birders Week was created for Black nature enthusiasts, everyone is welcome to participate. Follow along the #BlackBirdersWeek hashtag, or check out the @BlackAFInSTEM Twitter account. Ask questions, engage with their posts, or simply retweet the scientists to help amplify their voices. Scroll through the hashtags on Twitter and Instagram, and you’ll find a stream of Black naturalists honoring their love of the outdoors. “We want kids to see our faces and attach them to the outdoors, and we want our peers to recognize that we belong here too,” Grousis-Henderson tells Mental Floss. Not only does Black Birders Week make space for Black birders to share their passion, it’s also a way for the community to raise awareness of their unique experiences and addresssystemic racismin nature and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). According to Grousis-Henderson, it’s an opportunity to foster a dialogue within the birding community; to prompt conversations about diversity within the outdoors. “We wanted to draw on what we know about the diversity of biological systems and bring that perspective to social systems,” Grousis-Henderson says. “A diverse ecosystem can stand up to a lot of change, but a non-diverse ecosystem, one lacking biodiversity, is easy to topple.” The movement goes beyondbirding. Alongside Black Birders Week, Black outdoorspeople are sharing their experiences of what it’s like to be aBlack person in nature—a space where they’re far too often made to feelunwelcomeand unsafe. Organizations likeBackyard Basecamp,Melanin Base Camp, andOutdoor Afrocontinue to foster the Black community's connection to nature.

141,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/627935/livestream-new-englands-titanic-shipwreck-expedition,,"The weekend after Thanksgiving in 1898, New England was hit with a storm so fierce itsankroughly 150 ships and killed hundreds of sailors and passengers. It was nicknamed the “Portland Gale” after its most famous casualty: the SSPortland. The opulent, 291-footsteamshiphad been ferrying passengers between Boston and Portland, Maine, for nearly a decade when it perished in the Atlantic along with every person on board, and the tragedy shocked the entire region—people later began calling thePortland“New England’sTitanic.” But while we know all about the iceberg that clobbered the “unsinkable”RMSTitanic, nobody’s quite sure why the reliablePortlandwas unable to weather the 1898 storm. In fact, for 91 years, nobody knew where it was. Oceanographic technology had advanced considerably by 1989, when divers John Fish and Arnold Carrteamedup with Richard Limeburner, an oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), to search for the sunken ship. They knew where bodies and detritus from the wreck had been found along the shore, and they knew what time the ship sank—the victims’ watches had all stopped ticking around 9 a.m. After estimating the shipwreck’s general location by tracing the victims’ paths in reverse, they used sonar to scan theoceanfloor for signs of the ship itself. They weren’t disappointed. Theshipwreckrests in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, an area between Cape Ann and Cape Cod that’s home to approximately 200 shipwrecks. And although the researchers couldn’t prove their wreck was indeed thePortlandin 1989, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)confirmedit in 2002. Since then, there have been several expeditions to explore the remains, but none has solved the mystery of what caused its fatal plunge. Next week, the NOAA and the WHOI are joining forces for a new expedition—and they’re livestreaming some of it. The first two 45-minute programs are airing on Tuesday, August 25, at 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. EST on both theNOAAandWHOIwebsites. Viewers will follow a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) as it inspects thePortland, while scientists narrate its progress and answer questions about the project. They are, of course, hoping to find out why thePortlandsank. An earlier investigation revealed that the crankshaft on the port side was disconnected from the connecting rod, which could’ve caused an engine malfunction. However, that may have happened when thePortlandstruck the ocean floor. It’s also possible that the ship exhausted its fuel source before it could make it to safety. “We're still hoping to examine the boilers and see if there is any coal remaining,” Kirstin Meyer-Kaiser, the project’s lead scientist, tells Mental Floss. “If we cannot find any coal, this would suggest that thePortlandhad run out of fuel.” But the researchers aren’t only focused on filling in thePortland’s historical blanks. They’re also interested in studying its current role as a vibrant habitat for ocean life. For sponges, anemones, and other invertebrates that stay in one place—called sessile invertebrates—shipwrecks offer the chance to settle on higher ground, where ocean currents move more quickly and food floats by more often. “We actually see some pretty distinct patterns in thePortlandcommunity,” Meyer-Kaiser explains. “There's a dense aggregation of anemones on the walking beam, the highest point on the wreck, because those animals are taking advantage of the food sources available to them there.” A shipwreck’s nooks and crannies are prime real estate for fish and other species seeking shelter, and the abundance of those species then attracts predators to the area. In short, shipwrecks are fantastic forbiodiversity. “This year, we had the opportunity to visit a natural boulder reef site and compare the biological community to the wrecks we're studying,” Meyer-Kaiser says. “The boulder reef community had some of the same species, but it was missing the large sponges, anemones, and many of the fishes we see on shipwrecks.” Next week’s expedition will explore a second shipwreck, too: an unidentified coal schooner. Its hull is covered in a layer of copper to preventbiofouling, or the build-up of barnacles, algae, and other organisms that attach themselves to the submerged parts of vessels. Overexposure to copper can be toxic to marine life [PDF], and Meyer-Kaiser says the schooner’s layer has definitely kept its biological population smaller than it could’ve been. “It's actually fascinating to see anti-fouling measures working so well even a century or so later!” she says. In addition to studying the biodiversity thatisthere, the researchers will also hunt for clues that might help uncover the schooner’s identity. They’ve spotted a shoe, a bowl, a speed-measuring device, an instrument they think is a telescope, and the numbers898nailed into the bow stem post. According to Meyer-Kaiser, this figure is a little like a house number or a license plate, and they’re sifting through historical records to find a match. You can tune into the schooner expedition on Wednesday, August 26, at 2:30 p.m. EST and 6:30 p.m. EST, and on Thursday, August 27, at 2:30 p.m. EST, throughNOAAorWHOI."

143,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/626812/gut-microbiome-controls-craving-for-nature,,"After a few months spent indoors with only your family pod for company, you might be craving fresh air, birdsong, and the scent of a pine forest. A new theory called ""the Lovebug Effect"" suggests there may be a backseat driver in our daydreams of nature holidays and woodland strolls: the gutmicrobiome. Humans have an innate tendency to seek out and spend time innatural environments, but we’re still not really sure why. A new paperpublishedin the journalScience of The Total Environmentsuggests that our thirst for nature could be driven by microscopic life lurking in the deepest, darkest crevices of the gut. “While it seems clear that we benefit from having the drive to spend time in nature, the exact reasons behind nature-seeking behavior haven’t been resolved,” senior authorMartin Breed, a lecturer in biology at Flinders University, tells Mental Floss. “The Lovebug Effect is a conceptual piece that addresses this by drawing from recent work on how microbes influence behavior.” The human gut is home to trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Collectively, these microbes make up the gut microbiome, which orchestrates thehomeostatic harmonybetween functions essential to health. Gut-brain communication mediatesmetabolism,immune system function, andappetite, and could even explain that divine lurch ofbutterfliesin your stomach. The Lovebug Effect theorizes that gut-brain communication also drives nature-seeking behaviors. “Microbes in a gut environment that are starved of contact with environmental microbiota might be hijacking neural pathways between the brain and gut to drive nature-seeking behavior,” first authorJake Robinson, an ecologist and planetary health researcher at Sheffield University, tells Mental Floss. In other words, your gut microbes are yearning for their outdoor counterparts—and telling your brain to go find them. There’s now pretty robust evidence from animal studies that microbes caninterceptgut-brain crosstalk by activating thevagus nerveandsympathetic neuronsthrough their release ofkey neurotransmitters, such asserotonin, dopamine, and GABA. Breed says that when the microbiome is lacking in diversity, the chemicals it releases might have an effect on the brain that manifests as a thirst for nature. Once we're immersed in the great outdoors, we’re literally bombarded by environmental microbiota—a thimble-full ofsoilcontains billions of microbes, far more than there are humans on planet Earth. According to the Lovebug Effect, this abundance of environmental microbiota means our gut microbiome has countless choices when it comes to selecting which microbes to propagate. And the sensations we experience when immersed in nature offer plenty reason to return. Who doesn’t love the smell of fresh rain? This enticing scent,petrichor, is produced when rain hits bacterial spores in the soil. Breed and Robinson claim that these kinds of sensory preferences could be byproducts of an ancient nature connectedness, and evidence for ourco-evolutionalongside the microbiome. Unlikebehavior-altering parasitesthat usually end up killing zombified host animals, gut microbes that stimulate nature-seeking behaviors would also benefit the human host. Hands-on exposure to soil microbes mayboostthe immune system, and fresh country air offers a microbial diversity that avoids theaccumulationof harmful microbes. Mental health might also benefit; gut microbiome imbalances have been linked topsychiatric disorders, includingdepressionandanxiety. When starved of natural environments, however, the gut microbiome finds a way to cope.Marco Candela, an associate professor at the University of Bologna, found that gut microbiome imbalances in the isolated crew of theMars voyage simulation,Mars500, were normalized through a process of “microbial adaptation.” “Reductions in the butyrate-producing bacteriumFaecalibacterium prausnitziiwere compensated by increases in other butyrate-producing microorganisms,” Candela tells Mental Floss. This means that microbes readily replace the functions of dwindling ones. Another open question is how altering host behavior would benefit the gut microbiome when the microbes within arecompetingwith each other. “Most animal studies have shown the effect of a single microorganism on behavior, but the gut microbiota is an ecosystem,” Candela says. “It’s a fascinating topic, but needs more confirmation in humans.” To demonstrate whether the Lovebug Effect is more than speculation, researchers will likely have to examine the relationship between nature connectedness and microbial diversity, and pinpoint the mechanisms underlying microbiome behavioral control. Other than stimulating curiosity, the Lovebug Effect serves to remind us of our deep-seated connection with the natural world—and that it’s in our best interests to conserve it."

150,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/618620/fat-bats-resistant-to-white-nose-syndrome,,"Good news for flying mammals: chubby little brownbatsmight be genetically resistant to white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that’s killed more than 5.5 million bats since it was first documented in 2006 [PDF]. A newstudyin the journalScientific Reportsdescribes three genetic adaptations in the bats that could protect them from the pathogen. Little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus), common in Canada and the eastern United States, are especiallysusceptibleto white-nose syndrome. According to lead author Giorgia G. Auteri, a doctoral candidate at the University of Michigan, white-nose syndrome kills bats by disrupting their hibernation cycles. “When they’re in hibernation in the winter, they’re not meant to be waking up. They’re supposed to be asleep,” Auteri tells Mental Floss. “But this fungus grows on them, and it causes the bats to keep waking up during hibernation. And because they’re waking up when they shouldn’t be, they’re running out of fat reserves too early.” But while white-nose syndrome hasdevastatedbat populations in North America, not all infected bats die from the disease—some recover. Auteri wanted to find out what made the survivors so special. Auteri and her team compared the genetic makeup of nine surviving and 29 non-surviving little brown bats from northern Michigan. They discovered that survivors share three important genetic distinctions. “One is involved with fat metabolism,” she says. “And another is involved with regulating when the bats wake up from hibernation. And the third gene is involved in theirecholocationability, in their sonar for hunting insects.” The results make sense, Auteri says. Because white-nose syndrome interrupts bats’ hibernation schedules, bats with genes that relate to more optimal fat storage (i.e., they’re fatter) and better hibernation regulation (i.e., they sleep longer) are more likely to survive the disease. Auteri’s research could help scientists and conservationists find ways to preserve little brown bat populations. Besides being adorable, little brown bats also play an important ecological role as predators of insects like mosquitoes, moths, and other pests that are destructive to crops and forests."
151,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/618976/animal-crossings-around-the-world,,"Animals’ natural habitats are shrinking, and the spaces they have left are often carved up by dangerous, multi-lane highways. Highways fracture ecosystems into isolated parts, which can limit genetic diversity of the organisms in each portion and jeopardize a species’ chance of survival. When animals attempt to cross these barriers, they end up putting themselves in harm’s way, and depending on their size, they can threaten the safety of people on the road. A solution that’s gaining popularity around the world is the construction of animal crossings. Also known as animal bridges or wildlife overpasses, these structures extend over busy highways like normal bridges, but instead of cars, they provide safe passage to wildlife. Greenery planted over bridges can make them inviting places for wildlife, and fences along roads sometimes funnel animals toward the safe crossing points. Different types of bridges have been built to cater to different animals: There’s an animal crossing for crabs in Australia and one for squirrels in Washington state. Check out these and more examples of extraordinary animal crossings around the world below. Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, is home to megafauna like moose, elk, and grizzly bears. When these animals attempt to cross a highway, they pose a threat to human drivers and passengers as well as themselves. That’s why, beginning in1996, officials installed six wildlife overpasses and 38 underpasses on the Trans-Canada Highway, which bears 30,000 vehicles along the 25-mile stretch from Banff National Park to the Kananaskis River every day. Wildlife mortality in the area has dropped by 80 percent as a result of the animal crossings. Large animals like elk and bears aren’t the only ones that deserve safe passage across busy streets. Each year,50 million red crabson Australia’s Christmas Island head toward the sea to spawn—a mass migration that’s been complicated by human development in recent years. To help the crustaceans reach their destination safely, the island built a 16-foot-high bridge the crabs can scale to cross a busy road. Thirty-one special crab underpasses and 65 miles of plastic barriers funneling them toward the passageways were also installed. Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo in The Netherlands is the longest wildlife crossing on Earth. The 2625-foot-long, 164-foot-wide bridge stretches across roads, railways, and a sports complex. Animals like deer, wild boar, and European badgers use it to travel to isolated environments that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. Natuurbrug Zanderij Crailoo translates to “sand quarry natural bridge,” and it's one of more than 600 ""ecoducts"" in the nation. Animal crossings come in all shapes and sizes.Nutty Narrows Bridgein Longview, Washington, is suspended above a busy thoroughfare and it’s just wide enough to fit a squirrel scampering to safety. Local builder Amos Peters constructed it in 1963 to keep squirrels away from the traffic below. Since then, several similar squirrel bridges have been installed around town.   Overpasses that allow wildlife to avoid traffic are called “green bridges” in the UK. In 2018, one of these bridges opened above theKnutsford-Bowdon bypassonA556in Cheshire, England. The greenery is meant to attract small animals like badgers and voles. Unlike some other wildlife crossings, this one is open to people as well. A path on the bridge aids agricultural workers crossing the highway. Even before the construction of a wildlife bridge near Snoqualmie Pass in Washington was completed, it was attracting animals. Deer were spotted using the overpass to cross Interstate 90 as early as2018. After 8-foot walls were erected around the bridge to muffle noise and local flora was planted, the animal crossing official opened in 2019. It was designed to play host to elk, bears, and mountain goats, but some unexpected visitors have also been spied using the bridge. It was the site of an alleged Bigfoot sighting earlier in2020. When you hear the wordSingapore, you may picture a futuristic metropolis, but the island is home to plenty of wildlife as well as people. Two rainforestnature reservesoutside the city center were separated by traffic for three decades before a wildlife overpass linked them together in 2013. Singapore's Eco-Link @ BKE spans eight lanes and it was thefirstwildlife overpass of its kind built in Southeast Asia."

AsCNNreports, nearly 60 bears were spotted looking for food in the area, and experts say climate change is to blame. Normally around this time of year, Arctic sea ice is thick enough for polar bears to use it as a platform for hunting seals. Temperatures have been warmer than average this year, and without the ice to support them, hungry polar bears are being pushed south into human-occupied territories on land. According to a statement released by World Wildlife Fund Russia, the bears gathering in Ryrkaypiy arethin-lookingand include cubs and adults of various ages. So far, they've been subsisting on walrus carcasses that have been lain on the village's shore since autumn. No incidents between bears and villagers have been reported yet, but the 500 residents are on guard. Volunteers are now patrolling the town limits and school buses have started picking up children who would normally walk to class. Prior to this decade, it was unusual to see more than three or five polar bears near Ryrkaypiy at a time. But as climate change drives global warming and melts Arctic sea ice, seeing large groups of polar bears at lower latitudes is no longer an anomaly. Earlierthis year, Novaya Zemlya, Russia, declared a state of emergency after more than 50 bears invaded the region. As sea ice becomesmore scarce, the circumstances forcing hungry polar bears to share space with people will only get worse. [h/tCNN]"
154,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/616858/costa-rica-jaguar-rescue-center,,"In 2005, Catalonian primatologist Encar Garcia and her husband, Italian herpetologist Sandro Alviani, were living in southwestern Costa Rica when locals began to bring them injured animals in hopes that the two experts could save them. As word spread and more animals arrived, their property slowly transformed into a full-fledged rescue center. So they purchased the surrounding land andnamedtheir new organization theJaguar Rescue Center(JRC), after one of their early rescues: a young, orphaned jaguar whose mother had been killed by farmers. Today, the center covers nearly 5.5 acres of land near Puerto Viejo de Talamanca in Costa Rica’s Limón province. It can accommodate around 160 animals at a time, and is home to everything from spider monkeys to sea turtles (though, by law, staff members aren’t allowed to accept domesticated animals like cats and dogs). While locals still bring injured and orphaned animals to the JRC, others are brought by tourists, the Ministry of Environment and Energy, the National Animal Health Service, and even the police, who confiscate animals that have been poached or illegally kept as pets. The rescues are often victims of road accidents, animal attacks, environmental destruction, human interaction, or electrocution from exposed power lines. After the animals are rehabilitated, they’re released into La Ceiba Natural Reserve, a human-free (except for JRC workers) part of the forest where they can safely reacclimate to living in the wild. The JRC has cameras installed in the area to monitor the animals after their release and make sure they’re finding enough food. Unfortunately, not all the creatures brought to the JRC recover from their injuries—in 2019, for example, 311 of the 749 rescues died [PDF]—so JRC staff members and volunteers understand just how remarkable it is to watch an animal regain its health and be successfully returned to its natural environment. “There are so many amazing things about working for the JRC, but I think we all can agree that seeing a rescued animal make it through rehabilitation and be released is the best and most rewarding part of the job,” Torey, a JRC tour guide, tells Mental Floss. Some thought-to-be-orphaned sloths are even released right back into the arms of their mothers. After recording thecries of a baby sloth, JRC staff will take the sloth back to wherever it was first found, play the recording, and wait for the mother to recognize the cries and (slowly) climb down from her leafy abode to reunite with her child. Despite its partnerships with government agencies, the JRC doesn’t receive government funding. Instead, it relies on public donations and revenue from its visitor services. Find out more about how you can help below. You can make a one-time or monthlydonationthat will go toward food, medical care, and supplies for the animals, or you candonatespecifically to the JRC’s “Shock Free Zone” program, which insulates power lines and transformers that run through forests to prevent them from electrocuting wildlife. Check out the JRC’s Amazonwish listto see which items are most needed—and what they’ll be used for, too. Examples include Pampers diapers for baby monkeys, snake hooks for safely rescuing snakes, and cans of worms to feed birds, opossums, and bats. One of the most important products on the list is powdered goat’s milk, which staff members use to feed orphans of many mammalian species at the JRC. “It has the most universally digestible enzyme compared to other milk,” Torey says. “Unfortunately, we do not have sloth milk, monkey milk, etc. readily available for the baby animals.” For $105, you can virtually “adopt” an animal at the JRC. Choices range from Diavolino, a “feisty little margay” rescued from the illegal pet trade, to Floqui, a whitish two-fingered sloth who was born with only one digit on each hand and foot. You can stay overnight at the JRC in one of its three visitorresidences—La Ceiba House, Ilán Ilán House, or one of the Jaguar Inn bungalows—which offer a variety of amenities, restaurant service, and access to nearby beaches. Whether or not you’re staying there, you can book a tour of the JRC, where you’ll get to explore the premises and even meet some of the animals. There are private, public, nighttime, and VIP tours, and you can find out morehere. If you’re looking for a more hands-on, potentially life-changing way to help Costa Rica’s wildlife, you can apply for the JRC’s four-week volunteer program or a position at La Ceiba Natural Reserve that lasts three to six months. According to thewebsite, JRC volunteers are housed in the Jaguar Inn and help with “a broad range of tasks, from doing the dishes and cleaning up after the animals ... to building and remodeling enclosures, or babysitting a new arrival to ease the stress of their new environment.” La Ceibavolunteers, on the other hand, stay right on the reserve and do everything from monitoring captive and recently released animals to keeping the trails clear.

Able to withstand years of manipulation and abuse, the sets remain intact even when doll heads, action figure limbs, and electronic games fall by the wayside. If you needed further confirmation on their durability, science is here to help. Newresearchfrom the University of Plymouth in the UK published in the journalEnvironmental Pollutiondemonstrates that the bricks couldsurvivein some form for as long as 1300 years in the ocean. Not even constant exposure to saltwater can stop them. This projection was determined by researchers collecting LEGO bricks that had washed ashore in Southwest England. They compared the mass of these found bricks to similar LEGOs taken from storage. The 50 pieces, which are made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic, were retrieved from outdoor saltwater exposure to be washed, weighed, and measured. Their approximate age was estimated by using an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer to see which chemical elements were missing. A rate of deterioration was made based on their condition relative to the stored bricks. The result? LEGO bricks could hold on to some semblance of shape for anywhere between 100 to 1300 years. While not necessarily usable—some of the pieces decayed into blobs of plastic—researchers were able to demonstrate that microplastics can endure in the environment for indefinite periods. “The pieces we tested had smoothed and discolored, with some of the structures having fractured and fragmented, suggested that as well as pieces remaining intact they might also break down into microplastics,” Andrew Turner, the lead author and associate professor of environmental sciences at the University of Plymouth, said in a statement. “It once again emphasizes the importance of people disposing of used items properly to ensure they do not pose potential problems for the environment.” [h/tGeek.com]"

AsPopular Sciencereports, firefly species around the world are at risk of extinction. They're vulnerable to many of the same threats as other bugs, but there's one human-made problem that poses a unique threat to the insects: light pollution. A research team led by Tufts University biology professor Sara Lewis shared its findings on the causes of firefly decline in a new paper in the journalBioScience. To identify the biggest threats, they surveyed scientists, conservationists, and other firefly experts working in different parts of the globe about their observations. Most subjects pointed to habitat loss—a factor that's put pressure on species spanning the animal kingdom in recent decades. Fireflies have also fallen victim to insecticides, as have manyinsects, whether they're considered pests or not. But light pollution was the most surprising concern brought up by firefly experts. A firefly's light show isn't just pretty to look at—it's essential for the beetles' survival. The blinking caused bybioluminescenceis part of the insect's courtship rituals. Like the stars over a city sky, a firefly's flashes can be washed out by light from human-made sources. If fireflies can't see each other's light signals, they can't get together to mate, and populations suffer as a result. According to the study, experts ranked artificial light at night as the second highest threat to fireflies, with more than 23 percent of the planet's land experiencing some degree of light pollution. This report shows that curbing land development and insecticide use may not be enough to save fireflies from extinction. Moving forward, the study authors recommend regulating the usage of artificial outdoor lights to make them more suitable for firefly courtship. In doing so, conservationists may inadvertently help other species that evolved to thrive in darkness. The study's authors write, ""Reducing artificial light—both its extent and its duration—should, in contrast, benefit a wide range of culturally and economically important nocturnal animals.""

Plus, traditional burials take up land that’s quickly becoming scarce in urban areas. Cremation isn’t much better, environmentally speaking—a single cremationrequiresabout the same amount of energy that an individual would use over a month, and it produces harmful greenhouse gas emissions. “For every person that chooses to be recomposed instead of cremated or buried, it will save just over a metric ton of carbon, which is pretty significant,” Spade toldCityLabin January.

Finally, one of the guides who considered Sullivan a friend took Sullivan and other undercover agents to a grave that heproceededto dig up. The man cautioned them keep quiet. He said disturbing the bones was a ""lock-up offense."" It was exactly the kind of demonstration Sullivan had been hoping for. As the man speared the shovel into the dirt, Sullivan, wearing an audio recorder, was gathering evidence. The man and his associates were eventually convicted of illegally disturbing archaeological sites and graves, a violation of the Native American Graves Protection andRepatriation Act. Sullivan, who testified in court about the case, is still on active duty as an assistant special agent in charge. He is not an FBI agent or a member of any law enforcement agency. For over 35 years, he’s worked for the Investigative Services Branch of the National Park Service, adivisiondevoted to handling criminal activity committed on thestaggeringly vast85 million acres of federally owned land. The ISB routinely investigates animal poaching, missing persons, and homicides. And they do it with only a tiny fraction of the resources and manpower of the large law enforcement agencies. “Most of us came into the agency thinking we’d just investigate poaching or resource crime, and we do,” Sullivan tells Mental Floss. “But the vast majority are crimes against people. Rapes, homicides, and everything in between.” Inside the federal parks, he says, “People bring their problems with them.” When President Ulysses S. Grantsignedthe Yellowstone National Park Protection Act into law in 1872,he was officially establishing the country’s first national park. Ever since, hundreds of parks, all owned and operated by the federal government, have fallen under the NPS umbrella. The job of the NPS is to preserve and protect irreplaceable environmental assets. From the start, that’s been a challenge. While the land that makes up Yellowstone was onceoccupiedpeacefully by Native tribes, its increasing occupation by the government led to more disruptive activity. In the late 1800s,Yellowstonewas ravaged by poachers, squatters, and vandals who had no regard for the ineffectual authority of the park superintendents who doubled as police. In response, the government dispatched the U.S. Army in 1886, stationing soldiers throughout the park to patrol the grounds and deal with problems. When a bison poachergot away withlittle more than a wrist slap, the public was outraged, and lawmakers established the National Park Protection Act, or Lacey Act, of 1894 to provide more stringent punishment for troublemakers [PDF]. While the Army was an effective deterrent against crime, soldiers were not exactly a wealth of park information for visitors. Hoping to create more uniformity in the growing park system, President Woodrow Wilson approved the National Park Service Organic Act in 1916, setting the stage for a fleet of park rangers who could both police and tend to visitors. Eventually, even the rangers found themselves overwhelmed at times with activity in the park that required more specialized law enforcement attention. Following ariot at Stoneman Meadowin Yosemite in 1970, theYosemiteandOlympicnational parks hired criminal investigation specialists to look into serious infractions on park land. Other parks followed suit. Instead of parks hiring their own individual investigators, the NPS eventually opened the Investigative Services Branch, or ISB, which was given its formal name in 2003. But rangers like Sullivan had made the move years earlier. After starting in theOzarkNational Scenic Riverways in the early 1990s, he became one of the first ISB special agents. “I gradually worked my way into it,” Sullivan says. “After six years on patrol, I became an investigator.” If a serious crime happens on federal park land, the ISB typically has jurisdiction, though that can vary by location. (Some states have proprietary or concurrent rights to a crime scene, meaning they either take it over or work in tandem with the ISB or FBI. The latter two agencies can also work together.) That means a park official’s first call is typically to the rangers, who then contact the ISB, as in the case of theTheodore Rooseveltrevolver that wasstolenfrom Sagamore Hill in 1990. (It was recovered 16 years later.) The ISB, Sullivan says, is contacted when a crime exceeds the threshold for what rangers typically handle. That means calls to address violent crimes, significant acts of theft or poaching, and missing persons. In the Pacific Field Office headquartered at Yosemite [PDF], agents recently addressed a 2017 assault with a deadly weapon and strangulation at a campground in Haleakalā National Park; vandals who smashedDevil's Hole pupfisheggs, a species among the rarest on Earth, atDeath ValleyNational Park in 2016; and a DUI vehicular assault at Olympic National Park in 2017. Sullivan has seen no shortage of memorable cases—like his run-in with serial killer Cary Stayner, whocommittedmultiple murders in and around Yosemite, including the beheading of park naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong in 1999. Sullivan saw Stayner driving near the park at the estimated time of the murder. Stayner later confessed tofour killingstotal. According to Sullivan, what makes the ISB different from other investigative agencies is simple. They’re not a law enforcement agency. “We’re an agency that does law enforcement,” he says. “There’s a big difference.” Unlike the FBI, the National Park Service is not a multi-tiered agency devoted to criminal investigation. The NPS’s main priority is protection ofnatural resources, meaning that the lone branch devoted to crime—the ISB—is a small part of the machine. There are just 33 special agents covering the entire country in four locations: the Pacific, North Central, Southwest, and Atlantic Field Offices. Each is responsible for multiple parks in multiple states. The Atlantic office alone covers 23 states. “We expect [agents] to carry the bulk of the load and do the job,” Sullivan says. As a senior officer tasked with hiring, Sullivan says he looks for people who can work well by themselves and don’t mind the solitude that comes with operating in remote parts of the country. Some agents come, stay for a bit, and realize it’s not a fit. “We live and work at the end of the road,” he says. “If you enjoy the social aspect, the nightlife, it’s not for you.” Owing to the small staff, there’s no ISB forensic department. Agents rely on state or federal labs, hopefully building a rapport with local forensic analysts in the process. Because the ISB has to share resources, agents might also find themselves coming to the office and then being asked to jump on a helicopter to assist in an investigation three states away. Sullivan says that there’s a kind of freedom in not having to deal with a lot of bureaucracy. Agents don’t just make arrests and hand the perp off to another department. They often see a case through to the end and into the hands of a prosecuting U.S. attorney, as Special Agent Beth Shott did when she successfully investigated the 2012 death of Toni Henthorn inRocky MountainNational Park. Henthorn died after falling from a steep cliff, and her husband Harold had claimed it was an accident. ShottdiscoveredHarold had pushed her. The price for that kind of autonomy is being forced to be selective when tackling crimes. With so few agents and so much territory to cover, the ISB only accepts cases they stand a good chance of solving, using what Sullivan calls the “solvability matrix.” “We look at the level of crime,” he says. “Is it a felony? What victims are involved? Is there a suspect? Is there physical evidence?” Violent crimes often get the ISB’s full attention, though resource crimes—like the Native American grave-robbing case—can rise to the level of a top priority. The Pacific Field Office took on 49 new cases in 2018. Counting existing cases, the office worked a total of 117 incidents that year. While there is no crime unique to national parks, there is one recurring type of casethat all ISB agents have to cope with at some point: Missing persons, which often turn intocold cases. According to Sullivan, 30 people have disappeared from Yosemite since 1909 without ever being found. Across the whole park system, 23 people are currently listed on the NPS website as missing. It’s an eerie statistic, and one that speaks to the vast and remote territory that makes up the landscape of the national parks. “We deal with missing persons quite a bit,” Sullivan says. “People who have just vanished into the wilderness, there is lots of that.” Some were last seen hiking. Others are believed to have died by suicide. Many leave a car behind, the only trace left of them. All of Sullivan’s agents have at least one cold case assigned to them. When there’s downtime, they can pick up the thread and work on it. If tips come in from a call or the ISB’s social media presence on outlets likeTwitter, the case can warm up again, but they often have to take a back seat to cases meeting the solvability matrix. Among the most prominent of the missing is Paul Fugate, a park ranger who disappeared fromChiricahuaNational Monument in Arizona on January 13, 1980. After walking away from his station to hike a park trail, he was never seen again. Investigators suspected foul play was involved, but the case has yet to be resolved. Sometimes a body appears with no context. “Jane Doe,” who was found in Yosemite’s Summit Meadow in 1983, was a young woman believed to be the victim of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, though that’s never been proven. (Lucas, prone to falsely confessing to unsolved murders, died in 2001.) Not all such cases come to unhappy ends. In January 2020, visitor Martin Edward O’Connor waslocatedat Grand Canyon National Park after being missing for nearly two weeks. Sullivan tries to resolve cases like this one as best he can. With a small staff and the same number of hours in the day as anyone else, it can be difficult. The ISB is often unheralded, with Sullivan hearing a repeated joke about agents “investigating pinecones.” That could change if the ABC television network moves forward with a proposedseriesabout the agency, set to be produced by Kevin Costner. Regardless, agents will still be policing a serious expanse of public land. “Yosemite gets 5 million visitors a year,” he says. “That’s 15,000 to 20,000 people a day. We have the same problems as any population the same size. We’re here to deal with it.”"

Ananalysisfrom last year estimates the number of plants that have disappeared since 1750 is double than that of all birds, mammals, and amphibians combined. Plants are a vital part of the food chain, and as more of them go extinct, it could have catastrophic ripple effects across ecosystems. To draw attention to this issue, the online loan providerNetCredithas illustrated a map of the most endangered plant species in each state. To create the map, they looked at data from the United States Department of Agriculture and found species that were either endangered or threatened on the federal or state level. From there, they selected plants that were unique-looking, had an interesting history, or had a limited range. The result is a colorful graphic that demonstrates the diversity of threatened species in the plant kingdom. The map includes colorful flowers, like the dragon's mouth of Rhode Island and the American globeflower of Ohio. Other plants look more aggressive like the Nichol's Echinocactus that's under threat in Arizona. Two carnivorous pitcher plants make the list: the Jones's pitcher plant in North Carolina and the canebrake pitcher plant in Alabama. You can view the full illustrated map below.

They show geysers of water bursting forth from the tops of snowy mounds on Oval Beach. The scene looks like a bizarre version of a volcano spewing lava, but it's actually the natural result of the lake's tides. It was a great day to visit the beach and watch the waves interact with the ice.

ButLive Sciencesays ice shelves along the coast stop the waves of Lake Michigan from reaching the shore. As the tides move under the ice sheet, pressure builds, and with nowhere else to go, water breaks the ice and spurts through the opening. The water from each eruption freezes when it settles on the ice above the surface, and the ice layers build upon each other to form a cone shape. This is similar to how realvolcanoesform, only instead of layers of water freezing into ice, it's molten lava hardening into rock. There's no seismic activity going on when these ice volcanoes erupt: It's simply the lake's natural tide persisting in spite of freezing temperatures. But, like real volcanoes, they can be dangerous. The ice mounds are hollow and more fragile than the surrounding ice, so onlookers should appreciate them from afar.

Wildlife officials in New South Wales feared that the last natural stand of Wollemi pines would be counted among the billions of plants andanimalsdestroyed by Australia's recentwave of wildfires. But thanks to quick action from firefighters, the ancient grove has been saved,The Guardianreports. The first Wollemi pines date as far back as 200 million years, and the trees reached peak numbers65 millionto 34 million years ago. Since then, populations have shrunk so drastically that the species was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered 26 years ago. Fewer than 200 wild specimens exist today, and they're all concentrated in a protected sandstone grove in Wollemi National Park, about 125 miles northwest of Sydney, Australia. The Wollemi pines' fragile status means that one bad forest fire could spell its end. With this in mind, the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service and NSW Rural Fire Service prioritized their protection this bushfire season. Before the Gospers Mountain fire spread to the canyons where the trees grow, a team of firefighters was sent there by helicopter to install an irrigation system. This kept the trees hydrated and made them less vulnerable to flames. Helicopters also dumped fire retardant around the grove to weaken the fire when it arrived. The efforts weren't able be able to save every Wollemi pine from damage and destruction—a few trees survived with charring and two more died—but they were enough ensure the continuation of the species. With a population this small, protecting it is a never-ending battle. In addition to fire, visitors stepping on seedlings and introducing diseases also pose a threat. For that reason, the Australian government has chosen to hide the exact location of the grove from the public. [h/tThe Guardian]"

AtChernobyl, bears, wolves, birds, and even dogs have persisted, though visitors arecautionednot to pet them, because their fur might harbor radioactive particles. Now, there’s evidence of animal life thriving at another nuclear meltdown site. A newstudyin thejournalFrontiers in Ecology and the Environmenthas confirmed that several species are making the radioactive area in Fukushima, Japan home. While not as severe as the fallout in Chernobyl, the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 following a massive earthquake andtsunamiwas catastrophic. Three nuclear reactors experienced ameltdown, prompting the Japanese government to evacuate and relocate more than 100,000 people from nearby homes. Using cameras to capture activity across over 267,000 still frames, University of Georgia researchersfoundmore than 20 animal species living in the Fukushima Evacuation Zone and two other less-restricted zones that limit human occupation. Wild boar, rabbits, macaque monkeys, pheasants, and foxes were all recorded. While this study didn't evaluate the health of the animals in areas affected by radiation, their behavior seems to be consistent with normal patterns. Raccoons, for example, have remained nocturnal. Researchers also discovered sika deer, weasels, and black bears within the confines of the affected area.

169,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/546289/easy-ways-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint,,"Imagine a landmass the size of the entire continent of Africa burning as a massive forest fire for anentire year. Such an enormous fire would release nearly 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere—the same amount that human activity produces every year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's2015numbers. The scale at which we're pumping out CO2 is alarming, and it is all serving to trap heat on the planet and fuelclimate change. Fortunately, there are small, easy steps everyone can take toreducetheir personal carbon footprint (which you can calculatehere). Your breakfast sandwich, while delicious, isn't eco-friendly. Livestock consume a lot of resources and release the greenhouse gas methane into the environment every time theyburpandfart—which means animal products come at a high environmental cost. Add the toll that transporting and packaging the ingredients takes on the environment, and the average bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich comes out to about1441 gramsCO2 equivalent (a unit that measures global warming potential). For comparison, driving a car four miles produces about 1650 grams CO2 equivalent. Maybe grab some locally grown fruit the next time you're looking for a portable morning bite. Grass-fed beef has been embraced by the organic food movement, leading some people to believe it's the better choice for the environment. Buta 2017 reportreleased by Oxford's Food Climate Research Network shows this isn't the case: Grass-fed cattle only accounts for 1 gram of protein, per person, per day, compared to 13 grams from all ruminants, which includes cows, sheep, and goats. Despite this, grass-fed cattle still contribute one-third of all the greenhouse gases produced by ruminants—and the carbon-absorbing pastures they graze in don't do much to offset that. But grain-fed, factory-farmed meat isn't much better for the environment, and it comes with a whole different set of concerns, so a better option is to cut meat from your diet where you can. Traveling somewhere by plane is the quickest way to expand your carbon footprint. Just one round-trip flight between New York and Los Angeles produces abouta fifthof the emissions your car creates in a year. The best option for the environment is to fly less or not at all, but this is unrealistic for some people. An alternative is to book your seats in coach. Because they're allotted less space, and therefore require less fuel, passengers flying economy are linked to three times fewer emissions than those flying in business class. Look at first class and the difference is even more dramatic: Those flyers account for nine times the carbon emissions of passengers in coach. Next time you have a moment alone, check the tags of the clothes you have on. Unless you're a mindful shopper, your wardrobe likely crossed thousands of miles before ending up in your possession. The resources that go into making a single garment also add up: According to a report from Dame Ellen MacArthur's foundation, the fashion industry produces1.2 billion tonsof greenhouse gas emissions a year. Fortunately, there's an alternative to buying clothes from major chains that doesn't involve joining a nudist colony. Next time you need to replenish your closet, head to a second-hand store. Buying gently used clothing is better for the environment, and manythrift storesdonate part of the proceeds to charitable causes. It's easy to see how biking can reduce your carbon footprint. While the typical passenger car releases about404 gramsof CO2 per mile, a bicycle emits zero. If you live in a bikeable city or in an area with mild weather year-round, a bike is a worthwhile investment. Even if a bike can't replace your car completely, for shorter trips it's a great way to be gentle on the environment while saving gas money and getting a cardio workout at the same time. Heating your home in the winter is expensive, and it can also be a major contributor to your carbon footprint. Do the planet and your wallet a favor and turn down the thermostat by a degree or two when you're in the house. At night you should turn the heat down even lower, and when you're away you should turn it off altogether. Investing in asmart thermostatthat senses when you're in the house and adjusts itself is another way to reduce your carbon emissions. If you have the yard space for a clothesline, take advantage of it. According toThe Guardian, a household that uses a dryer 200 times a year could shrink its carbon footprint by roughly half a ton of CO2 by air-drying laundry instead. Even if you don't have the option to use a clothesline year-round, avoiding the dryer forjust halfyour loads would make a difference. Just because an appliance is turned off doesn't mean it isn't consuming energy. According toHow Stuff Works, the ""phantom energy"" zapped up by electronics that stay plugged into an outlet around the clock can account for 10 percent of your electric bill (which, if you factor it out, would be more than a free month's worth of electricity each year). If you can't stand plugging and unplugging every gadget around your home all day, try leaving appliances you don't use on a daily basis, like toasters, desk lamps, etc., unplugged and only power them up when you need them. Every piece of waste you toss in the garbage adds to your carbon footprint. You may not be able to bring your trash production down tonothing, but you can reduce it by investing in non-disposable goods that can withstand a bit of wear and tear. Reuseableshopping bags,food storage containers,coffee cups, andstrawscan replace many of the items that are often thrown away every day. If you still use incandescent bulbs to light your home, it's time to make a change. Incandescents use electricity inefficiently, adding money to your electricity bill and your home cooling expenses, thanks to the excess heat they generate.Energy Star-qualifiedlight bulbs like CFLs (compact fluorescents) and LEDs (light-emitting diodes) are more energy-efficient than the average light bulb and last six times as long. If every household in America swapped just one regular light bulb for one of these options, we could reduce CO2 emissions by 9 billion pounds. For trips where biking isn't an option, see if you can find a friend. Car travel isn't great for the environment, but hitching a ride with someone going the same direction as you makes a much smaller impact than driving alone. Next time you're at work, look around the office for potential carpool buddies. And before your next night out with friends, suggest a system that doesn't involve everyone coming in a separate car. One way to make your electric laundry machine a little gentler on the environment is to switch on the cold water setting. That simple change can reduce your washer's carbon emissions by75 percentand save you $60 for every 300 loads of laundry you clean. And for lightly soiled clothing, cold water sanitizes just as well as a warm wash. Curtains aren't just there for privacy—throughout the year, they can help lower your energy consumption. When the sun is hitting the house, keep your windows clear in the winter to take advantage of thatfree heat source, and close them during peak daylight hours during the summer (especially when you aren't at home). On winter nights, conserve energy by drawing your curtains closed and blocking the heat inside from leaking out, and either open your windows at night for a fresh breeze or close your curtains to keep the air conditioning in during the warmer months. Keep up these habits year-round and you'll see the difference in your heating and cooling bills. You don't need to deprive yourself of the pleasure of a hot shower to adopt a more eco-friendly lifestyle. According toMother Jones, we would save 20.9 billion pounds of CO2 a year if we all shaved one minute off our shower sessions. If that change sounds easy for you, try taking thefive-minuteshower challenge for a week or two. One of the easiest ways to take care of the planet is also the most fun. Set aside an afternoon to plant a tree in your backyard and the benefits will last its whole life. A young tree absorbs roughly13 poundsof CO2 per year and a mature tree can absorb 48 pounds. After 40 years, a tree will have sequestered1 tonof carbon that would have otherwise contributed to global warming."

For glaciers, it’s a little different. Every summer, a Swiss group swaths the Rhône glacier in enormous fleece blankets to block the sun from melting it. Because the blankets are white, the glacier still looks relatively normal from afar. But the color wasn’t chosen for aesthetic purposes: As Live Sciencereports, white helps reflect light before it hits the ice. Though glaciologist David VolkentoldAgence France-Presse in 2015 that he believes the blankets could slow the damage by up to 70 percent, he also acknowledged that it’s a stall tactic, not a permanent solution—on a hot day, 3 to 5 inches of theglaciercan still slip away. For Switzerland, concern for the future of this particular glacier extends beyond itsenvironmentalimplications. Beneath the grayish surface of the Rhône glacier lies an otherworldly,blue icegrotto which draws thousands of visitors each year. According to Switzerland’s national tourismwebsite, the 330-foot-long tunnel is redrilled annually and has been a tourist attraction since 1870, when the Furka pass road made it easily accessible by foot. Fleece blankets are just one innovative method scientists have proposed to combat glacial melt all over the world. As Atlas Obscurareports, John C. Moore, chief scientist at Beijing Normal University’s College of Global Change and Earth System Science, and his colleagues suggested separating a Greenland glacier from the warmer water that erodes its icy edges by creating a barrier of gravel and sand between them. Another idea was to simply vacuum away that water completely. Johannes Feldmann, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and his team proposed fortifying the West Antarctic ice sheet by turning 8 trillion tons of ocean water into snow and blasting it onto the sheet. Founder and CEO of the nonprofit Ice911 Leslie Field’s project is similar to the ice blankets—she’s currently testing a reflective material made from microscopic glass balls that could keep ice cool beneath the sun. While some people are working on temporary fixes, others are finding ways to honor the glaciers we’ve already lost toclimate change—likethis plaquefor the Icelandic glacier Okjökull. Let’s hope the Rhône glacier doesn’t see the same end anytime soon. [h/tLive Science]"

When Northern Denmark’s Rubjerg Knude lighthouse was built in 1899, there was more than 650 feet of land separating it from the coast.According toCondé Nast Traveler, that seemingly safe expanse of sand had eroded to fewer than 20 feet by the 2000s. To rescue the 1000-ton landmark from imminent destruction, local mason Kjeld Pedersen approached the Danish government with an innovative proposition: Slide the lighthouse to safety on a pair of custom-sized rollerblades. Since a similar plan had succeeded in moving a gun repository in Skagen, a town about 45 miles from Rubjerg Knude, the government gave the green light (and 5 million kroner, or about $743,000) to Pedersen. Last week, Pedersen and his team mounted Rubjerg Knude on a pair of roller blades attached to a track, and scooted the structure about 263 feet inland. It wasn’t exactly a rip-roaring ride—they moved it 0.001 mph. At that rate, the entire operation took almost 50 hours. As one can imagine, Pedersen was a bit tired after such an epic undertaking. “It’s been overwhelming for him,” Visit Denmark’s Nina Grandjean Gleerup toldCondé Nast Traveler. “I think he’s told Denmark ‘Don’t use me anymore’ because of all the attention!” Gleerup also explained that Pedersen’s humble diligence and creativity reflected the spirit of the neighboring fishing towns, Løken and Lønstrup, which are known for quaint coffee shops, galleries, and beautiful natural landscapes.

It’s called “Young People Marching,” and it’s dedicated to 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. The song is done inRaffi’s signature style, with a moderate tempo, simple arrangement, and easily repeatable lines. And, on the surface, even its message seems upbeat—it’s a celebration of all the young people peacefully marching forclimate change. But it’s hard to miss Raffi’s deeper meaning if you tune in to the lyrics, which feature phrases like “Decades of lies, decades of denial … decades of obstruction,” “The science is clear, it’s late in the hour for climate action,” and “Green New Deal, keepin’ it real.” As much as it honors the “millions and millions of young people” now devoted to the cause, it’s also a frustrated rebuke of the older generations who created the mess that today’s children must clean up. The music video reinforces this point by juxtaposing footage of the Amazon wildfires, melting glaciers, and ocean trash with scenes of children participating in climate strikes. If you only know Raffi’s most popular numbers, you might think this is a surprising about-face for the 71-year-old entertainer, but he’s actually been speaking out (and singing out) against climate change since the late 1980s. In 1989, after hearing a Canadian radio series calledIt’s a Matter of Survivalthat stressed the climate emergency, Raffi released an album for adults calledEvergreen Everblue, which covered concepts like atomic waste and ethical commerce.According toSlate, he even decided against having children because of the deteriorating state of theenvironment. Raffi told Slate that he won’t be playing “Young People Marching” at his concerts, but he encourages climate activists to use it as an anthem. “What I’m saying to all the climate strikers is, ‘Here, take this song, play it at your rallies, learn it, sing it, do what you like,’” he told Slate. “This is what I can do. This is what I can offer. I wrote it as an offering, as a troubadour marking a moment in time.” For Raffi, it isn’t a question of politics—at this point, he says, everyone should treat the situation as an emergency. “You’d be delinquent if you didn’t rise to the occasion and become a responder.” Press play on “Young People Marching” and read up on ways to reduce your carbon footprinthere.

175,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/589720/venus-flytraps-in-peril,,"On certain calm days in North Carolina’s Green Swamp Preserve, the chirps of birds and insects give way to the sound of crackling. Tendrils of blue-gray smoke unfurl in the air, and the ground, thickly carpeted with high grass and woody shrubs, blackens beneath a steady wave of flames. Hidden among the tallest vegetation caught in the blaze are some unusual-looking plants that grow in the underbrush: Venus flytraps, standing just afew inchestall, their needle-toothed “mouths” gaping toward the sky. It takes just moments for the fire to reduce their iconic profiles to molehills of ash. A team of officials from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission watches the whole scene unfold. They aren’t there to put out the fire—instead, they stoke it by skimming the grass with handheld drip torches [PDF]. When the patch of wilderness before them is completely charred, they let themselves relax: Their job is complete. These prescribed burns—which replace fires that used to happen naturally, and recreate the conditions in which the plants originally evolved—are essential to the Venus flytrap’s wellbeing. Going to such lengths might seem strange, given that anyone looking for a Venus flytrap to decorate their dorm room windowsill or manage a fly infestation can find one easily: They’re available for less than $6a pot at big box hardware chains, and for $10 to $30 at independent plant stores. But in the wild, the plant can only be found in one spot: a75-square-mile area of North and South Carolina. That accounts forless than a thirdof species's historic range. Only302,000Venus flytraps remain there, down from4 millionin the 1970s. In the face of such decline, scientists have petitioned to put the plant on the Endangered Species List. And while prescribed burns aid in the Venus Flytrap’s survival, they’re not enough toguaranteeit. Not when the plants are also threatened by land development, climate change … and poachers. Many of the greatest minds in historyhave been captivated by the Venus flytrap. Thomas Jefferson madeseveral attemptsto acquire its seeds, and in 1804, he finally planted them in a pot. But the plants are finicky: Venus flytraps thrive in habitats with damp, low-nutrient soil and lots of sunlight. The swampy coastal plains of the Carolinas have exactly the soil flytraps need, and without the boggy conditions of the Carolina coast, Jefferson's flytraps likely never poked past the soil. Seventy-one years later, in his bookInsectivorous Plants, naturalistCharles Darwindescribed the flora, writing: “This plant, commonly called Venus' fly-trap, from the rapidity and force of its movements, is one of the most wonderful in the world.” You don’t need to be immersed in the botanical world to understand the flytrap’s appeal. The carnivorous plant is different from a fern or succulent; it moves and interacts with its environment, placing it in a special category between plant and pet. It rests with its leaf blades open, perfuming the air with a sweet nectar that lures insects. The inside of the trap contains six short, bristly hairs that are sensitive to motion. When prey disturbstwo of these hairswithin a short span of time—or if it brushes against the same hair twice—it triggers the hinged leaf blades. The tooth-like cilia trimming the jaws mesh together, ensnaring the meal as acidic juices inside the trap start to digest it. The unsettling process has enamored humans for centuries. ""I think [carnivorous plants] have a lot more personality compared to normal plants, even if they are just normal plants,"" Josh Brown, owner and operator of San Francisco'sPredatory Plants, tells Mental Floss. ""Venus flytraps in particular are very dynamic. They move faster than any other plant their size, and people find that very compelling."" The public’s fascination with flytraps drives commercial demand for the plant, but they haven’t gotten any easier to cultivate from seeds since Jefferson’s lifetime. For most of history, the easiest way to obtain them was by poaching. In1956, North Carolina passed legislation granting the Venus flytrap state protection. But even with its protected status, it was still legal to collect the plants from the wild under special circumstances. If someone had a permit and the land owner’s permission, they could pick flytraps from private property. Some plant sellers took this route, while others skipped the legal process and simply strolled onto state land with a shovel and a bucket. On the off chance they were caught, the punishment was a small fine. In 1981, there was a breakthrough that should have ended Venus flytrap poaching for good. Looking to remove some of the pressure from wild populations being targeted by poachers,William Carroll, part of the botany department of the University of North Carolina, cloned Venus flytraps in his laboratory for the first time. It was nothing like trying to grow flytraps in a home garden. In a sterile petri dish, the specimen thrived. “You can just take a piece of Venus flytrap and put it in a solution of agar, which is a seaweed-derived gel with some nutrients in it, and it will just start growing after a short period of time,” Brown says. Some plants carry pathogens—whichcontaminatetissue culture,impedinghealthy cell growth—that make it hard to raise them in a sterile lab. Venus flytraps don’t have this problem, and in the age of cloning, sellers can use leaf clippings from a single plant to propagate unlimited Venus flytraps for pennies apiece. For entrepreneurs with a stake in the Venus flytrap market, the cloning was a stunning success. But it didn't stop the poachers. On November 1, 2015, two men emerged from the tall grassof North Carolina'sOrton Plantationlooking exhausted. They were boxed in by police officers, and after volleying across the field a few times, Scottie Stevenson, 44, and David Lewis, 23, stopped running and accepted whatever penalty awaited them. Hands raised, they approached the authorities and asked for a bottle of water. At that point, it wasn’t yet clear what the pair was guilty of. Law enforcement had been called to investigate a trespassing complaint, but the way the men fled upon their arrival suggested the crime was more severe. It took a police dog less than 10 minutes to locate the source of their panic: Discarded in the grass was a backpack stuffed with 1025 Venus flytraps along with the machete used to harvest them. Stevenson and Lewis were among the first people charged with violating a 2014 law designed to protect Venus flytraps. Prior to the new legislation, Venus flytraps had the protection of the state law passed in the 1950s and not much else. Even if poachers plucked hundreds of them from federal land—as many of them did in the1990sand2000s—the strictest penalty they faced was a $50 fine. North Carolina upgraded Venus flytrap poaching from a misdemeanor to aClass Hfelony on December 1, 2014. That means that poaching a single plant can now send someone to prison for months—and each plant that gets stolen is treated as an additional offense. After Stevenson and Lewis were arrested, they were held on a $1 million bond—an amount normally reserved for murder suspects. They were ultimately charged and convicted with one felony count. More recently, in March 2019, a poacher was charged with216felony counts—one for each Venus flytrap he took from the Green Swamp Preserve. It’s too early to say if the law is an effective deterrent for poachers, but conservationists have their doubts. “I think some of the poachers aren’t aware that it’s a felony to poach Venus flytraps in most of the North Carolina counties where it occurs,” Johnny Randall, the director of conservation at theNorth Carolina Botanical Gardenat Chapel Hill, tells Mental Floss. Flytrap poachers are typically locals, often from families that have been collecting the plants for generations. “An ordinary person would not wander out through a wet pine savanna or the areas where these Venus flytraps occur,"" Randall says. ""There are canebrake rattlesnakes, lots of biting insects. It’s not for the faint of heart to go out into these areas. The poachers are people who have grown up in this kind of environment, so they’re familiar with it.” Poachers usually enter the areas where Venus flytraps grow carrying machetes and pillowcases, and according to Randall, one person can harvest 500 plants in an hour—so a single raid can deal significant damage to local flytrap populations. And according to Randall, “The poor fellows who are being paid $.25 cents per plant are just trying to eke out a living in economically depressed areas of North Carolina, so even though they are breaking the law, these poachers, they’re not the real bad guys.” So who are the bad guys? Experts suspect that, in most cases, these local poachers are doing the dirty work for larger buyers and seeing just a fraction of the profits, though exactly which forces are driving the Venus flytrap black market remains unclear—especially given the plant's ready availability. Conservationists have their theories. Randall points to pharmaceutical manufacturers that use Venus flytrap extract to make supplements, and cites the German company Carnivora specifically. Carnivora’swebsiteclaims that the plant has immune-boosting properties, and the label bills it as “the original natural discovery from Europe.” In an email to Mental Floss, however, the company says it doesn’t use wild plants to make its product: “We have our own production facility here in the U.S. and our manufacturing process results in no plants being used from wild habitats.” Don Waller, a conservation biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, suspects rare plant collectors overseas are behind many poaching crimes. Even though they’re identical to plants grown in labs, wild Venus flytraps may be more valuable in the eyes of certain buyers. “Interestingly, it's European collectors who are kind of fanatics about having a wild, collected plant,” he says. “They are willing to go on the dark internet and seek out these poached plants which they consider superior for some reason to commercially propagated plants.” While potentially devastating to Venus flytrap populations, poaching isn’t the main culprit behind the species’s decline. Conservationists agree that other environmental issues, like habitat loss, are bigger threats—that, and a lack of fire. TheWilmington, North Carolina, region—which sits at the center of the Venus flytrap's range—has undergone rapid development in recent years. Many of the wet savannas that once sustained vibrant flytrap populations have been replaced by golf courses andshopping centers. ""The populations now are fewer than they used to be, and they tend to be more separated from each other by roads or inhospitable habitats,” Waller says. “Any time you fragment a population it becomes more vulnerable to local extinction."" The Venus flytrap's home is no longer the safe environment it once was, which means simply replenishing swamps with flytrap clones isn't enough to sustain wild populations. But the biggest problem for the species, according to conservationists, has to do with fire. The plant's habitat is technically a swamp, but after a few days of baking in the sun, the sandy soil there becomes dry enough to support forest fires. Regular blazes arevitalto this ecosystem, and to ecosystems around the world: They clear out debris and leave behind empty, fertile land that supports new plant growth. For centuries, if a bolt of lighting or the heat from the sun sparked a fire in the woods, the blaze burned until it fizzled out naturally. In some parts of the continent,Native Americanseven ignited their own controlled burns as a way to manage the land. This changed when the first European colonists arrived in North America. Forest fires were seen as destructive forces that needed to be contained, and while fire suppression did save lives and property in many cases, it also disrupted the natural cycle of the environment. Venus flytraps were among the species hit hardest by the practice. When people started extinguishing natural fires in the Carolina region without allowing them to spread, taller shrubs were free to flourish and smother the ankle-high plants. But even in nature preserves that conduct controlled burns, the species’s future is uncertain. As climate change raises sea levels around the world, flooding will become more common, and the low-lying coastal plains that flytraps call home fall directly in the danger zone. “A large fraction of its population could be vulnerable, even to a meter or two of sea rise,” Waller says. Rising temperatures could also soon make their current habitat inhospitable: “These guys will need to move North if they are to match their current climate environment, and it’s not easy for them to move if their populations are smaller and more isolated from one another,"" he adds. Unlike most animal species, flytraps can't flee immediate threats. Luckily, conservationists are coming up with some creative solutions to help save them. The Venus flytrap may be vulnerable, but it isn't doomed.Establishing more nature preserves like the Green Swamp is one way to protect the flytrap’s habitat from future development projects. And once those areas are set up, wildlife managers can keep the land healthy by burning it. In theGreen Swamp Preserve, periodically setting the ground on fire has become a normal part of the conservation plan. After plotting out where the burn will happen, officials pick a day with the perfect weather conditions (not too windy, not too dry) to ignite thesupervised blaze. The flytraps burn up with the rest of the shrubbery, but when the next generation emerges from the soil, they’re able to thrive without having to compete for sunlight with thick, unruly brush. In Waller’s view, one of the most effective ways to ensure the species’ survival is to grant it federal protection. He's one of the scientists at the head of the movement to add Venus flytraps to the Endangered Species List. In2016, he led a petition to get the species recognized and launched an online campaign promoting the cause. It’s not the first time scientists have tried to garner protection for the plant: It was considered for listing in theearly 1990sand rejected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service due tolack of evidence. But scientists are hoping things will be different this time around. “It's declined rapidly since the 1990s when the Fish and Wildlife Service considered it for listing,"" Waller explains. ""So that was the basis for our petition: That this is a plant that is not hypothetically in trouble but getting rapidly into trouble now and needing the protection of the Endangered Species Act.” According to theAct, species are considered endangered if they’re at risk of becoming extinct throughout all or a large part of their natural range. The Fish and Wildlife Service is currently considering the Venus flytrap for protection for the second time. If it makes the list, the federal government will have to identify thecritical habitatsfor the species and extend special management and protection to those areas. That could mean funding existing nature preserves, funding the creation of new nature preserves in vulnerable flytrap habitats, and ceasing anyfederal activitiesthat would cause the species harm. Dale Suiter, an endangered species biologist with the FWS, tells Mental Floss that research is being conducted to see if the plant qualifies. “We’re currently working with the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program, and they are conducting a status survey which means they are trying to revisit as many populations as possible over this growing season and next growing season [...] After we get the results of that two-year study that we’ll start to evaluate the data and try to make a decision on what to do with the species.” However, the success of the species in the marketplace could present a stumbling block. “There are people who don’t think the plant should be listed as endangered, either because they think the plants are doing fine, which they are not, or because they realize there are huge numbers of these plants raised in captivity,” Waller says. “And if you can buy a plant at your local hardware store or nursery, what business does it have being on the Endangered Species List?” Indeed, adding the Venus flytrap to the Endangered Species List will need to be managed carefully.The listing of a common houseplant does come with potential drawbacks: If conservation laws don’t differentiate between Venus flytraps propagated in labs and plants grown in the wild, some people in the carnivorous plant business fear they could see their livelihoods disappear. “If it was made illegal in the U.S., that would probably lead to it being wiped out in the wild, because that would increase the black market value of it tremendously,” Joel Garner, who runs the online shopJoel's Carnivorous Plants, tells Mental Floss. “The Venus flytrap is one of the most mass-produced plants in the U.S., so you’re shutting down a pretty big market if you were to make that illegal. It would kind of be a situation where good intentions produced the exact opposite results you were trying to get."" An endangered designation for the species wouldn’t automatically kill the industry, however.Pitcher plants—another carnivorous plant that’s popular with buyers—are extremely endangered, but shops can still sell them as long as they can prove they were grown in a lab or a nursery. Even with these provisions, Venus flytrap sellers may be wary of the red tape they’d have to navigate under stricter conservation laws. Waller is aware of this possibility, and he’s already proposed potential fixes. In a paper published in the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter [PDF], Waller and co-author Thomas Gibson encourage commercial growers and authorities to work together to create a habitat conservation plan before any new laws are passed. The plan they suggest takes something that’s been a detriment to efforts to protect the Venus flytrap in recent decades—its commercial popularity—and turns it into a strength. By adding a $.25 to $.50 surcharge to every plant that’s sold, sellers could generate revenue to fund conservation efforts. The paper estimates that such a program could raise millions of dollars a year toward acquiring new flytrap habitats and maintaining existing preserves. And it would come with an added bonus: each pot would include a tag telling buyers their purchase helps protect the species in the wild, raising awareness of the problem with the people most likely to care. “The public is very enthusiastic about Venus flytraps,” Waller says. “They buy them in great numbers, they kill them sometimes, and feed them insects in the meantime. What a remarkable plant.”"

177,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/601545/plastic-tea-bags-shed-microplastics,,"When it comes to good consumer habits, numerous (and often conflicting) reports have people questioning everything from theircoffee drinkingto theirphone usage, but until recently, curling up with a warm mug of tea seemed OK. Anew studymay change that. As theCBCreports, certain types of tea bags could deposit billions of microplastic particles into your tea. Nathalie Tufenkji, who teaches chemical engineering at McGill University in Montreal, was inspired to investigate the plastic content of tea after ordering thehot beveragefrom a coffee shop one day. Instead of a classic, compostable paper tea bag, her tea leaves came bundled in a pouch made from a silken material. The item was actually made from plastic, and it was an example of the ""fancy"" teabags made from nylon and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) that are gaining popularity with certain tea brands. So what does that mean for your morning cup of tea? According to the researchers' study, published in the journalEnvironmental Science & Technology, steeping one of these bags in hot water can release up to 11.6 billion microplastic particles and 3.1 billion nanoplastic particles into your drink. Microplastics are miniscule plastic bits no biggest than a dust mote, and nanoplastics are even smaller. Even with billions of them swirling in your teacup, the particles add up to a total plastic content of just one-sixtieth of a milligram. Microplastics aren't limited to fancy tea bags.Seafood, table salt, and even tap water all contain tiny pieces of plastic. We consume so much of it that one study found we'reexcreting 20 particlesof the stuff per every quarter pound of waste. But even in a world where microplastics are unavoidable, the numbers in this recent study are noteworthy: Tea made from the plastic tea bags studied containsthousands of timesmore plastic that what has been observed in other food products. The study indicates that the plastic content of some teas is high, but it doesn't say what that means for your health. That's because no evidence yet shows microplastics are harmful to humans when ingested. It's possible that the adverse health effects will become more apparent as the current population ages, but it's also possible that the human body deals with microplastics the same way it deals with otherenvironmental toxins. The tea bag study also comes with some caveats: The researchers looked at only four tea bags (and an additional four were used as controls), so a larger sample size may have revealed that this level of microplastic content isn't found in all tea made from plastic-based bags. If you'd still prefer to avoid mixing plastic with hot beverages, look for tea brands that use biodegradable paper and steer clear of pyramid-shaped bags and other pouches made from silky mesh material. Not only are paper bags lower in plastic contaminants, but they also add less waste to the environment. [h/tCBC]"

If a police officer has the inclination, he or she could write a ticket for up to $1000. The crime? Excessively warming up a motor vehicle's engine. According toNews 12, the law stipulates that automobile owners are permitted to let their cars warm up for 15 minutes, but only if the vehicle has been parked for more than three hours and the temperature is less than 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Cars that were running less than three hours prior only get three minutes. A first offense can result in a $250 fine; a second, $500; and a third, $1000. The law even applies if the car is parked in a private driveway. And yes, the state is serious. But why be so harsh on idlers? It's actually for a good reason. According to a state fact sheet [PDF] on the practice, excessive idling of a gas or diesel engine releases contaminants into the air, with fine particle pollution responsible for health issues. Since the offense is difficult for law enforcement to actually witness first-hand, the state encourages citizens to report violations. The state makes exceptions for refrigerated trucks, emergency vehicles, and vehicles stopped in traffic. The state has alsodebunkeda commonly-held myth that cars need to be “warmed up” in order to avoid engine damage. Electronically-controlled vehicles need just 30 seconds or so, with drivers cautioned to avoid rapid acceleration or high speeds for the first four miles during cold weather. The practice of warming up was more applicable to older model cars thatusedcarburetors that needed to get air and fuel into the engine. Today’s cars use sensors to monitor temperature and make the correct adjustments. Idling is now just a waste of fuel, though the practice persists—people like warm cars. While the attempt to freshen the air may be admirable, New Jersey residents are probably correct in thinking the law may berarelyenforced. From 2011 to 2016, only a few hundred summonses for violating the idling law have been written annually. In 2015, 276 were issued, with 148 of them dismissed. [h/tNews 12]"

Keep things neat and organized by repurposing your old prescription bottles. If you have enough of them at home, you can designate separate bottles for each type of jewelry you need to store. Now, instead of spending 10 minutes looking for the mate to your favorite earring, you’ll know exactly where you left it. Buying travel-size toiletries is a hassle—and throwing away your full-sized bottles at airport security when you inevitably forget to buy the smaller ones is even more frustrating. Reusingold pill bottlessaves you a trip to the drug store. When packing, just squeeze a dollop of your shampoo, conditioner, sunscreen, and whatever other liquid products you need into separate containers. You can customize the amount you need for the length of your trip, and then wash and save the bottles when you get home. But the best part is that you won’t need to wait until you get off the plane to moisturize. You can’t spend coins when they’re loose in your drawers and the pockets of your winter coat. Old prescription bottles are the perfect size for organizing spare change. Keep a few empty bottles out at home so you can empty your purse and pockets after you walk in the door. You can even use different bottles to separate coins by value, which will make your life easier if you ever get around to rolling those coins and taking them to the bank. An old pill bottle makes a great first home for any plants you’re trying to grow from seeds. Just stuffdamp cotton ballsinto the bottom of the canister, add the seeds, and cover them with a layer of soil. You can even attach a magnet to the side of the bottle to make a decorative mini-planter for your fridge. Once the seedling is big enough, transfer it to a larger home and find new seeds for your upcycled plant container. Do you need matching containers for your dried herbs and spices? Before spending extra money, see if you have any prescription bottles in your medicine cabinet at home. The containers fit snugly onto a spice rack and are just wide enough for you to scoop atablespoonpast the opening. Plus, the same amber plastic designed to protect medications from harsh light is just as effective at protecting spices."

Now, newly published time-lapse footage illuminates another aspect of the dire situation. AsLive Sciencereports, a British team of scientists captured this video of the Store Glacier in western Greenland on July 7, 2018. It shows a lake of meltwater on the ice rapidly draining in a span of hours. When cracks form on glaciers in the summer, they fill up with water, creating massive, temporary lakes. These meltwater lakes become a problem when the water drains deep into the glacier, where it can damage the base and dislodge ice chunks into the ocean. Melting ice that drifts out to sea is one of thedriving forcesbehind rising sea levels. In a paper published this month in thejournalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers report that the lake captured in the video flushed more than 1.26 billion gallons of water—the equivalent of 2000 Olympic-size swimming pools, notes Live Science—toward Store Glacier's base even without fully draining.

That means if the Amazon were to disappear today, instantly (e.g. we harvested all the wood and used it to build houses) then the oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue on at the same level. Until, that is, the wood rots. Then the carbon dioxide levels would increase. Except for the biomass decrease from human-caused fires, the biomass of the Amazon has not been changing. That means that no net carbon dioxide is being removed from the atmosphere, so no net oxygen is being released from carbon dioxide. Recently the Amazon biomass has been changing due to fires. When that happens, the wood and other carbohydrates in the trees combine with oxygen and produce CO2 and H2O. Thus the burning of the rainforests contributes to global warming. But under normal situations, when the biomass of the Amazon is not changing, there is no net production of oxygen or carbon dioxide. Incidentally, many writers who don’t understand this—and mistakenly think that the Amazon produces net oxygen—double their error by using a backward metaphor. They refer to the Amazon basin the ""lungs of the world,"" but lungs are the organ thatremoveoxygen from the air and replace it with carbon dioxide, not the other way around. Where did the 20 percent figure come from? The best guess is that ecologists have calculated that 20 percent of the photosynthesis of the world takes place in the Amazon basin. But so does 20 percent of the consumption. This post originally appeared on Quora. Clickhereto view."
183,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/604599/forests-vs-woods-vs-jungles-what-is-difference,,"If you're an English speaker, there’s a good chance you often use the wordswoods,forest, andjunglecorrectly without even thinking about it. Even if a patch of trees takes up a significant portion of your backyard, you probably wouldn’t consider it a forest; and you wouldn’t talk about the beautifulfall foliagein New England’s jungles. Based on those examples, it seems like woods are smaller than forests, and jungles aren’t found in colder climates. This isn’t wrong—but there's more to it than that. According to Merriam-Webster, aforestis “a dense growth of trees and underbrush covering a large tract,” whilewoodsare “a dense growth of trees usually greater in extent than a grove and smaller than a forest.” The reason we consider forests to be larger than woodsdates backto the Norman rule of Great Britain in 1066, when a forest was a plot of land owned by the Crown that was large enough to accommodate game for royal hunting parties. Whether that land contained trees or not was essentially irrelevant. These days, scientists and land managers definitely consider the presence of trees necessary for land to be classified as aforest. To set it apart from woods, or woodland, it usually has to meet certain density qualifications, which are different depending on whom you ask. According to the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), a forest must cover about 1.24 acres of land, and its canopy cover—the amount of land covered by the treetops—must exceed 10 percent of the acreage [PDF]. “Other wooded land” must also span about 1.24 acres, but its canopy cover is between 5 and 10 percent. In a nutshell, the FAO thinks forests and woods are the same size, but forests are more dense than woods. Australia, on the other hand, employs plant ecologist Raymond Specht’sclassification systemfor its vegetation, in which any tree-populated land with less than 30 percent canopy cover is a woodland, and anything more dense than that is a forest. Unlikeforests, jungles don’t have specific scientific classifications, because the wordjungleisn’t really used by scientists.According toSciencing, it’s a colloquial term that usually denotes what scientists refer to as tropical forests. Tropical forests are located around the Equator and have the highest species diversity per area in the world. Since they’re so densely populated with flora and fauna, it makes sense that bothMerriam-Websterand theEncyclopedia Britannicadescribe jungles as “tangled” and “impenetrable.” They’re bursting with millions of plants and animals that are different from what we see in temperate and boreal forests to the north. Because most of us aren’t in the habit of clarifying which type of forest we’re talking about in casual conversation, it’s no surprise that we often refer to the temperate forests we see in our own climate simply as forests, which we differentiate from those rich, overgrown tropical territories to the south by calling them jungles. To summarize, forests are historically and colloquially considered to be larger than woods, and scientifically considered to be more dense. Jungles are technically forests, too, sincejungleis a casual word for what scientists call a tropical forest. And, all differences aside, it’s relaxing to spend time in any of them—here are 11scientific reasonswhy that’s true. Have you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

To give itself some room to experiment before committing to a global roll-out,McDonald’sis testing out plastic-free restaurants in Germany and Canada. Food & Winereportsthat the first location to go green was a McDonald’s in Germany’s Mall of Berlin, which the burger behemoth dubbed the Better McDonald’s Store for 10 days in June. While some changes were pretty standard—paper straws and wooden cutlery replaced their plastic counterparts, for example—others demonstrated a commendable level of creativity. Condiments came in edible waffle cups, and burgers were served in wrapping made from actual grass. According to apress release, the Berlin trial was a way of allowing customers and stakeholders to contribute to the discussion and provide feedback soMcDonald’scould adjust its large-scale game plan accordingly. “Normally, McDonald’s goes out with perfect solutions,” Diana Wicht, the sustainability department head for McDonald’s Germany, explained in the press release. “This time we said ‘We don’t have perfect solutions yet … Please help us!” Unsurprisingly, customers did have some thoughts. The grass packaging was a straightforward success, and the waffle cups had a fair number of fans, too—though some felt the shape of the cups could be better optimized for dipping McNuggets. Straws presented more of a conundrum, because most people acknowledge that while plastic straws are evil, paper straws disintegrate too quickly to be a workable solution; some customers suggested completely eliminating straws for patrons dining in the restaurant simply by serving lid-less drinks. Wooden cutlery, however, was a flop; one of every two customers surveyed said it tasted “woody.” Overall, McDonald’s deemed the experiment a success, and has opened two comparable stores in Ontario and British Columbia to gauge Canadian customers' responses. The fast-food giant has also sprinkled smaller sustainability changes in other stores around the globe. McDonald’s Canada swapped out its napkins for smaller ones manufactured from recycled fibers, and McDonald’s UK is in the process of ditching plastic McFlurry lids and replacing plastic salad containers with recyclable cardboard versions. Hopefully, the McDonald’s sustainability overhaul will also lead to the invention of a McFlurry machine that doesn’tbreak downso often. [h/tFood & Wine]"
185,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/587307/when-river-thames-froze-londoners-held-frost-fairs,,"During the winter of 1563, the River Thames froze into a solid sheet of ice.Queen Elizabeth I, availing herself of royal privileges, ordered her servants to set up an archery field on the frosty surface and tried her hand shooting at marks. Reportedly, she was a very good shot. The unusual setting for the sport was forged by average winter temperatures in Europe that were as much as 2°Clowerthan today. The cold causedLondon’s main waterway to freeze into a thick platform for spectacular winter festivals called frost fairs. “Of booths there were a great number, which were ornamented with streamers, flags, and signs, and in which there was a plentiful store of those favorite luxuries,gin,beer, andgingerbread,” wrote George Davis, a London printer. Is his 1814 bookFrostiana: or A History of the River Thames in a Frozen State, Davis provides a first-hand account of one of these lively winter carnivals, during which Londoners abandoned the city streets and stepped onto the ice to indulge in food, spirits, and fun. A hedonist atmosphere prevailed: Men huddled around roaring fires to spin yarns while women filed into drinking tents to sip grog. Sporting enthusiasts, like Queen Elizabeth I, showed up for hare hunting, nine-pin bowling, and football, while fiddlers belted out jigs. The frozen wonderland was set against a backdrop of the19-arch London Bridgeand the irresistible aroma of spit-roasted meats. The fair even had its own main street: “The grand mall or walk was from Blackfriars Bridge to London Bridge; this was named ‘The City Road,’ and lined on each side with tradesmen of all descriptions,” Davis wrote. Frost fairs emerged during a nearly six-century-long cold spell—theLittle Ice Age—when Europe experienced some of its coldest, harshest winters on record. The chill was brought on by a number of factors, including periods of low sunspot and volcanic activity in Indonesia that spewed sunlight-reflecting aerosols into the atmosphere and cooled temperatures.George Adamson, a lecturer in geography at King's College London, says fluctuations in the jet stream may have also played a role. “Sometimes we get larger ‘meanders’ in the jet stream which mean that the whole of the UK is located to the north of it,” he tells Mental Floss. “Within these conditions, colder air is brought in from Siberia.” The hydrodynamics of the river also played a role. The old London Bridge’s closely spaced piers thwarted water flow, causing ice to build up beneath its stone archways. The bridge had a dam-like effect on the river, allowing it to freeze to the point where it could handle the weight of thousands of people—and even an occasional elephant—during the winter carnivals. “The floating masses of ice with which we have already stated the Thames to be covered, having been stopped by London Bridge, now assumed the shape of a solid surface over that part of the river which extends from Blackfriars Bridge to some distance below Three Crane Stairs, at the bottom of Queen-street, Cheapside,” Davis reported. When the frigid winters brought the usual rhythms of commerce to a halt, frost fairs presented an economic opportunity for tradespeople and artisans. With their river routes were temporarily blocked with winter ice, ferrymen earned a few pence by offering sledge rides to fairgoers and selling books, toys, and trinkets from market stalls. Barbers, fruit peddlers, and goldsmiths also set up their shops on the ice. Printers hauled out huge clunky presses to crank out personalized fair tickets, poems, and cards that played up the novelty of publishing atop a frozen river. One of the frosty commemoratives read: The 1814 fair—the last known frost fair on record—might have been a welcome break for Londoners weary of hearing about Napoleon’s victories in Europe, according to historian Sean Munger. “London was not a fun place to live in 1814,” he tells Mental Floss. “The country wasat war, the economy was depressed, and theking was insane. On top of that, there had been a terrible snow storm right before the fair that caused the city’s water mains to freeze and everything ground to a halt. The fair was kind of an escape where people could get away from their misery for a couple of days.” As the 19th century wore on, it became less likely that thick ice would form on the Thames. The medieval London Bridge was torn down and replaced with a new one that allowed the river to flow more freely. In 1870, the Victoria Embankment was constructed along the Thames upstream from Blackfriars to relieve congestion on riverside streets, which narrowed the river and further increased its current. Along with milder winter temperatures, the new infrastructure made the frost fair of 1814 the last one on record. Since then, the Thames has frozen over a few times—most recently in 1963. But whether frost fairs will ever return is anyone’s guess. As Earth’s climate continues to change and Europe gets warmer, the long-term outlook doesn’t look too cool."
186,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/598840/michigan-bob-ross-happy-little-trees,,"Bob Rossmade a living painting “happy little trees,” but in Michigan his legacy has been transferred from the canvas to real-life happy trees in nature. Bob Ross Inc. and Michigan’sDepartment of Natural Resources(DNR) have teamed up with inmates in three of the state’s correctional institutions to plant trees.Roadtrippersreports that to celebrate the 100th year of Michigan’s state park systems—and to honor Ross—the DNR renamed their “prison grow” program Happy Little Trees. The program teaches prisoners horticulture skills by growing trees from native seeds collected by volunteers. Each year, the inmates help grow around 1000 trees. The state uses those young (and happy) trees to replace damaged or diseased trees that reside in parks, campgrounds, and trails all over Michigan. In 2019, 22 out of 103 parks—about 20 percent—will be the recipient of healthy and happy trees grown by the inmates and a staff of volunteers. To commemorate Ross’s involvement, several parks are scheduled to have commemorative signs. Orchard Beach, Port Crescent, and Yankee Springs parks will have green signs with Bob Ross’s face (afro and all) happily painting outlines of trees; the words “Happy Little Trees Ahead” appear below the outlines. DNR is always looking for morevolunteersto plant trees, and those who sign up receive a special groovy T-shirt featuring Ross’s likeness. Next year marks the 25th anniversary of Ross’s death, so the tree-planting program is particularly appropriate. As Ross once said: “I got a letter from somebody here a while back, and they said, ‘Bob, everything in your world seems to be happy.’ That’s for sure. That’s why I paint. It’s because I can create the kind of world that I want, and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Shoot, if you want bad stuff, watch the news.” Ross probably would have been thrilled to have his name attached to a program that grows thousands of happy little trees in the wild."
187,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/546495/things-you-can-do-help-keep-oceans-clean,,"Each year, millions of people plan trips to the most beautiful beaches all around the world for relaxing afternoons of sunbathing and swimming in the ocean. Our beaches and oceans are a natural wonder that should be taken advantage of, after all. But they're also facing a pollution crisis. From untold tons of plastic to carbon emissions and household chemicals getting into our waterways, the dangers facing marine life are mounting. It's important to realize that it's not enough just to enjoy our oceans—we also have to keep them clean and actively protect them. And here are 15 ways you can help. It's hard to clean up the ocean without knowing why and how it gets polluted in the first place. So the first step is to get informed. Go online, turn on adocumentary, or grab a book from the library—there are countless ways to learn about the ocean without having to move off the couch. Learn how your plastic water bottle winds up in the ocean in the first place, or how the oil from your engine can travel through the sewer and into nearby bodies of water. You can even learn about lesser-known forms of pollution—did you know that evennoise pollutionunderwater can kill marine life? The best way to begin your ocean advocacy is to know the hows and whys. There are plenty of reasons to cut down on the plastic you use every day, but if you want to do your part for the ocean, it's doubly important. To put it into sobering perspective: It's possible that around8 million tonsof plastic get into our oceans every year, harming plant life, water quality, and marine animals around the globe. To put that into further perspective, near Los Angeles, around10 tonsof plastic fragments find their way into the Pacific every day. Single-use plastics are among the most wasteful, but they're also the easiest change you can make to your lifestyle. Instead of buying single-use plastic water bottles in bulk, switch to reusable bottles you can fill up again and again. There is also a movementamong cities, countries, and certain restaurant chains to get rid of plastic straws, bags, utensils, and other smaller plastic items that can be easily swapped out for something more sustainable. Make that change in your own home, too. It's not just individual consumers who need to watch their plastic consumption—it's local restaurants and global corporations as well. Find out which companies and businesses employ the best practices when it comes to packaging and plastic usage and which ones don't. If you feel like your local take-out place or café is being excessively wasteful, tell them. (Also, do your part by telling them you don't need any plastic utensils or paper napkins if you're planning to eat at home or the office.) And if your issue is with a larger chain, get in touch with them on social media or write an email. Then you can start digging deeper.Harmful microbeadsare banned in the U.S. [PDF] for their impact on oceans, but what about in other countries? And are the products you're using actually free of them? Find out, because while you may practice clean ocean habits, the companies you buy from may not. Pesticides, fertilizers, weed killers—three things that are ubiquitous on lawns and gardens around the world, but each can be very harmful for our oceans. Pesticides and weed killers work by usingdangerous chemicals, and though your plants and yard may benefit, those chemicals can easily get into our water systems. And if you live close enough to anocean, they’ll likely end up there. Fertilizershave aninteresting effecton the eco-system. The excess nutrients can be carried by rain and wind to various water systems. Once in rivers, lakes, streams, and oceans, these nutrients can help with the growth of algae at an unnatural rate. When this happens, the algae's natural toxins can not only poison marine life, but the algae itself can use up the oxygen in certain areas of water, making it impossible for anything else to survive. These are called ""dead zones,"" and the roughly 500 of them around the globe cover some245,000square kilometers (that's about the size of the UK). Luckily, thereare waysto have and maintain a garden while being responsible to the environment. Picking up after yourself on the beach should go without saying, but just take a look around the sand the next time you're by the shore—obviously someone didn't get the memo. Stray bottles, cans, bags, and napkins can be ubiquitous along waterways, and even just one piece of litter can pose a problem. This garbage can be picked up by the wind, get stuck around the necks of birds and other animals, and carried back out to sea by the tides. Keep anyone in your party accountable for their messes, and if you encounter some trash that isn't yours, pick it up anyway and throw it away. That plastic bag or discarded soda can is an immediate threat to any marine life that could get caught in it, so be sure to do your part. Picking up litter while on a beach vacation is great, but you can alsoorganize your owncleanup in your community if you live near an ocean. First, talk to local politicians and community groups to see if there's an existing ocean cleaning effort in your area. If not, go through those channels to help organize one. This is a great way to call on townspeople in your area—including friends, strangers, and local schools—to help beautify the area and teach positive habits when it comes to maintaining a cleaner ocean. Not everyone lives near an ocean to help do the legwork, but a simple donation can go a long way. Research charities in your state or around the country that helpclean the oceanand see if they're holding a fundraiser or collecting supplies for a cleanup effort. In addition to donating to cleanup charities, there are also ways to give money to research efforts,conservation groups, andeducational foundations. Medicines have been detectedin groundwaterand inmarine lifein the past, likely from being flushed and lingering in water systems afterwards. And 4500 wet wipes were found in a 154 square-meter portion of theThames riverin 2017—a byproduct of a bathroom staple that doesn't break down in the flushing process like people think. These are just two examples of products that are often flushed or poured down a drain without a second thought but could build up over time and pollute local waterways, soil, and oceans. Cotton balls, floss, cat litter, insecticides, vegetable oil, paint—this is a snapshot of things that are harmful for oceans and marine life if flushed. So next time you open that toilet lid to discard a harsh cleaning agent,find outif it's safe. Any of the water you use in your home is later sent to a sewage treatment plant [PDF] where the pollutants are removed before being reintroduced into local bodies of water. The problems come not only when harmful products and chemicals are flushed, but also when we simply use too much of the available water. As theSurfrider Foundationpoints out, excess water at these treatments plants can overwhelm the systems—many of which are older anyway—leading to pollutants getting through and finding their way into oceans, rivers, streams, etc. To do your part, simply conserve the use of water in your home. Takeshorter showers, don't leave sinks running, and cut down on any superfluous activities like washing your car for long periods of time. Whether you're out on a cruise or fishing on a lake, be mindful of what you leave behind. Never throw any trash overboard, even if you think it's harmless, like a stray fishing hook or line, or something small like a used piece of chewing gum or a cigarette butt. There's a ripple effect to any foreign item that enters a waterway, and often the consequence is that those tiny items amass into a large problem for the local ecosystem. Encourage those around you to be similarly mindful, and take proactive measures to ensure garbage and recycling bins are onboard during your trip. Being a responsible seafood consumer is a vital part of ocean conservation, and knowing what fish you're eating and where it's coming from is a big part of that. Familiarize yourself [PDF] with the fish you buy and where it wascaughtwhen you pick out your next meal, and ask your local supermarket chain or restaurant if their selection of seafood has been farmed in an ethical way that protects the ocean's ecosystem and doesn'tpollutethe water in the process. What's your state representative or governor's stance on ocean pollution and conservation? Is your state considering offshore drilling, which can result in accidents that impact the environment? Find out what the politicians in your state are doing about the environment and see if it's a plan that will provide a cleaner ocean for future generations. If your state is in a good place, ask if there is a chance to volunteer to help realize the goals of your elected officials. If your state isn't doing enough about the oceans, write letters and get in contact with both elected officials and local environmental clubs of influence. For instance, the Pacific Fishery Management Council recently voted to protect approximately 140,000 square miles of ocean from bottom trawling, a move that will prevent commercial fishing nets from harming coral and rocky reefs in that area.According toThe Pew Charitable Trusts, who were also involved, this vote was a result of five years worth of research and lobbying from environmental groups and charities, and thousands of letters from activists and concerned citizens. Taking care of oceans and waterways requires vigilance, and staying informed is vital to that cause. Read up on the latest products that have been deemed harmful to the ocean or environment (like this recent study on whyblack plasticcan't be recycled the same way as other plastics); keep an eye out for any environmental tragedy, like an oil spill or a tropical storm in your area that requires a cleanup; and be sure you're in the know about any organized rallies or fundraisers you can take part in. Carbon dioxide isn't just responsible forpollution in the air—it also makes its way into the ocean. In fact, abouta thirdof manmade CO2 makes its way into the ocean, which equates to about 22 million tons a day. This can cause acidification of the water, which affects the health of the marine life—especiallyshelled animals—that live there. Taking stock of your owncarbon footprintis important, and it becomes even more urgent when you think of the impact it has on everything. Climate change is all connected with one danger leading to another, leading to another, and so on. See how your energy habits can bemore sustainablefor the environment and make some much-needed adjustments. Simply driving less, buying energy efficient lights and appliances, and using fewer disposable goods can help. Don't keep all this knowledge to yourself! Bring up some of the more important facts to friends and family next time you're at the beach or out at a seafood restaurant. Invite them to join you for a cleanup, and encourage them to be mindful of their own carbon footprint. Your enthusiasm for healthy oceans and environments could be contagious, and you may soon find yourself with a network of like-minded individuals looking to make a difference."

Now, China is looking to establish its own version of the park. As theAssociated Pressreports, China is developing a national parks system inspired by the program in the U.S., starting with a preserve partly modeled on Yellowstone. Sanjiangyuan will be China's first national park and it's expected to debut in 2020. The park sits in the Qinghai province in Western China's Tibetan Plateau, which is home to rapid urban development as well as some of the last truly remote places on Earth. The region also contains many of the last snow leopards living in the wild. Snow leopards are avulnerable species, and the location for China's pilot park was partly chosen to provide them a safe haven as well protect the 1500 other species of endangered and threatened animals and plants that live within its borders. Conserving species and natural wonders are the main goals of the country's new parks system. When the plan was in development, Chinese officials visited American sites like Yosemite and Yellowstone to see what a successful national park looks like. They also invited policy makers and scientists from the U.S. and elsewhere to Qinghai province to consult on the project. China's program won't be an exact replica of what's already been done in the United States, of course. There are currently 128,000 people living in or around the land set to become Sanjiangyuan, and they will continue to reside there when the park opens next year. Officials plan to work with local communities to manage the site; one program called “One Family, One Ranger” hires a member from each local family to be a trash collector or ranger for the park for about $255 a month.

There are no permanent residents on the island, and anyone looking to step foot there needs to obtain a permit first. But the isolated patch of land is plagued by a problem that's common in cities: Rampant pollution. Rubber bands have been turning up there by the thousands, and experts think the problem stems from the bands' resemblance to worms,Smithsonianreports. The rangers who managed the island owned by the National Trust were initially baffled by the appearance of the bands. The knew they weren't coming from the site's visitors, so something else had to have been transporting the trash there. Birding organization West Cornwall Ringing Group investigated the mystery further this year. Mullion Island is a sanctuary for gulls and other types of seabirds, so the researchers visited their old nesting area to clear the built-up waste and possibly identify its source. They found what they were looking for in pellets of bird poop: The feces contained remnants of rubber bands and fishing line, indicating that the birds had been mistaking them for food. They likely picked up the bands while looking for food on the farms of nearby Cornwall. Many of these farms grow flowers and use rubber bands to secure them together, and scientists believe birds searching for food in the fields then eat the bands. If the Mullion birds are swallowing rubber and plastic and feeding it to their young, that could have disastrous consequences for the population. Researchersreportedthat the 2019 nesting season was ""disappointingly poor"" for the 70 pairs of great black-backed gulls on the island. The presence of litter on the island was likely just one factor at play: Warming seas and dwindling fish stocks have driven the decline of seabirds across the UK in recent years. [h/tSmithsonian]"
190,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/606900/potted-plants-do-not-improve-indoor-air-quality,,"Sometimes accepted wisdom needs a more thorough vetting process. Case in point: If you’ve ever heard that owningplantscan improve indoor air quality in your home or office and act as a kind of organic air purifier or cleaner, you may be disappointed tolearnthat there’s not a whole lot of science to back that theory up. In fact, plants will do virtually nothing for you in that respect. This botanic bummer comes from Drexel University researchers, who just published astudyin theJournal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology. Examining 30 years of previous findings, Michael Waring, an associate professor of architectural and environmental engineering, found only scant evidence that plants do anything to filter contaminants from indoor air. Many of these studies were limited, the study says, by unrealistic conditions. Plants would often be placed in a sealed chamber, with a single volatile organic compound (VOC) introduced to contaminate the air inside. While the VOCs decreased over a period of hours or days, Waring found that the studies placed little emphasis on measuring the clean air delivery rate (CADR), or how effectively an air purifier can “clean” the space. When Waring converted the studies' results to CADR, the plants's ability to filter contaminants was much weaker than simply introducing fresh air to disperse VOCs. (Additionally, no one is likely to live in a sealed chamber.) The notion of plants as natural air filters likely stemmed from a NASA experiment in 1989 which argued that plants could remove certain compounds from the air. As with the other studies, it took place in a sealed environment, which made the results difficult to translate to areal-worldenvironment. Plantscanclean air, but their efficiency is so minimal that Waring believes it would take between 10 and 1000 of them per square meter of floor space to have the same effect as simply opening a window or turning on the HVAC system to create an air exchange.

As emotionally devastating as it may be to see the lush, beautiful landscape ablaze, it also poses a threat to the future of Earth overall. As CNNreports, the Amazon rainforest—the largest in the world—has been called the planet’s lungs because it generates about 20 percent of the oxygen in the atmosphere. If the situation continues to worsen, the Amazon could transform into a dry savannah, driving away forest wildlife and annihilating the vegetation on which our planet relies so heavily for oxygen. In that case, the Amazon might even begin to emit carbon—the main culprit behind global warming. As normal people with standard garden hoses thousands of miles away from the fires, it can be frustrating to feel like there’s nothing we can do. But there are still plenty of ways you can help save the rainforest—check out some ideas below,suggested byFast Company. The Rainforest Action Network works with grassroots organizations and forest communities to help establish sustainable environmental practices and combat destructive industrial activities throughout the rainforest. The lowest suggesteddonationto protect an acre is $25, but there’s also an option to enter a custom amount if you want to donate more or less. The Rainforest Trust purchases sections of rainforests all over the world and then partners with conservationists on projects to preserve specific habitats, communities, and species. Among other things, they’re currently fundraising to save indigenous lands in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest—you can donatehere. The Rainforest Alliance’s cute green frog symbol denotes that certain forest and farm products sourced from rainforests are environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable.

Slothsare one of the many animals threatened by deforestation and other habitat loss at the hands of humans in the Amazon rainforest. With your symbolicadoption, you can help the World Wildlife Fund cut down on industrialization and restore conditions that allow for sloths and other species to flourish and contribute to a healthy, oxygen-generating ecosystem. Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro has faced backlash for championing industry over preservation in the Amazon rainforest, a strategy that many believe has exacerbated the conditions that have created the forest fires. If you’d like to add your name to the list of those who want the Brazilian government to do more to protect the rainforest, you can sign the Greenpeace petitionhere. A lesser-known but equally important method of preserving the rainforest is to build up indigenous communities whose knowledge, cultures, and traditional practices already protect their environment. Amazon Watch works with indigenous partners to expand their sustainable practices and defend their rights against industrial corporations who threaten their autonomy. You can donate to the causehere.

Historically, the vibrant transformation starts to sweep through northern regions of the Rocky Mountains, Minnesota, and New England in mid-September, and reaches its peak by the end of the month. Other areas, including the Appalachians and Midwest states, don’t see the brightest autumn leaves until early or mid-October. The Weather Channelreportsthat this year, however, the forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts unseasonably warm temperatures for the next two weeks, which could impede the color-changing process. Warm temperatures aren’t necessarily bad for fall foliage, as long as they occur during the day and are offset by cool nights. Since meteorologists don’t expect the overnight temperatures to drop off yet, plants will likely continue producing enough chlorophyll to keep their leaves green in the coming days. The good news is that this year’s fall foliage should only be about a week late, and meteorologist David Epstein thinks that when leaves do start to change color, we’re in for an especially beautiful treat. If the current weather forecast holds, hetoldBoston.com, we'll ""see a longer season than last year, we’d see a more vibrant season than last year, and it would come on a little earlier than last year, which was so late.” Though poor weather conditions like early snow, heavy rain, drought, or strong winds can cause leaves to fall prematurely, most trees right now are in a good position to deliver a brilliant display of color after a healthy, rain-filled summer.

193,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/592220/how-to-survive-a-shark-attack,,"When the Discovery Channel rolls out its annualShark Weekprogramming, we’re once again reminded of our fascination withsharks, the apex predators who possess the destructive power of a table saw. Why the appeal? According to shark expert and former Australian Navy clearance diver Paul de Gelder, ruminating over sharks and their ability to dominate us in the open waters is just human nature. “It’s fear of the unknown,” de Gelder tells Mental Floss. “It’s a fear of an animal you can’t see coming eating you alive.” De Gelder is uniquely qualified to comment on our preoccupation with sharks. In 2009, he wasattackedby a bull shark, which took part of his right arm and part of his right leg. Rather than hold a grudge, de Gelder has become a shark advocate. “I never blamed the shark,” he says. “The shark was just doing what a shark does in the ocean.” Attacks like the one de Gelder endured are incredibly rare. According to the International Shark Attack File maintained by the Florida Museum, just 129 attacks wererecordedin 2020. Of those, 57 were unprovoked attacks—in other words, an incident “where an attack on a live human occurs in the shark’s natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark.” (In many cases, these attacks are more like test bites, with sharks using their mouth toexplorethe potential for something being dinner.) On the highly unlikely chance you come face-to-nose with a shark, de Gelder has some tips that may improve your chances of survival. If you’re in water and find yourself suddenly in the company of a shark, instinct will tell you to relocate immediately. Resist that urge. “When you see a predator, you want to get away as fast as possible,” de Gelder says. “But then you’re far more likely to get bitten.” Panicking will put a shark in predatory mode. Remember: Just because a shark is around doesn’t mean you’re automatically on the menu. “When we do swims with sharks, nine out of 10 people will say, ‘I didn’t feel threatened. I didn’t feel like the shark wanted to attack me. It was just curious.’ Hold on to that. It will keep you calm.” Like dogs, sharks respect assertiveness. “The best thing to do is confront a shark,” de Gelder says. “Not with aggression. Stay calm. Keep your eyes on it. Show them you’re a predator, as well.” If a shark approaches, you can push them away. You don’t want to start a fight you’re likely to lose, but you may avoid one by letting the shark know you’re not docile. The unfortunate reality of a shark attack is that if one does decide you might be food, you don’t have much say in the matter. Even a test bite, where the shark may give you an inquisitive nibble, can cause grievous injury. And if it’s a full-bore assault, you’re in all kinds of trouble. “'When the shark grabbed me, I felt pressure,” de Gelder says of his own attack. “But I didn’t feel the teeth go in. I didn’t feel any pain until it started shaking me and ripping me apart.” Still, doing something is better than nothing. De Gelder advises to “go wild,” punching and attacking the shark however you can. The eyes, nose, and gills are all good targets. “Anything that shows the shark you won’t take it,” he says. “Maybe you’ll get out.” Having a weapon on hand is even better. You can use a knife and aim for the gills or underside of the shark, but don’t try stabbing the top. “You won’t be able to penetrate it,” he says. If you’re fortunate enough to have a shark lose interest, swim as fast as you’re able to shore or safety. If you have an arm wound, make sure you keep it raised above your heart. “Keeping it above your heart will stem the bleeding,” de Gelder says. After losing his hand to the shark that attacked him, de Gelder had the presence of mind to raise his arm, which may have contributed to his survival. Humans are no match for sharks, and the wounds the animals inflict can be devastating. One thing de Gelder was careful not to do was look at his severely damaged leg. “I thought that if I didn’t look at the wound, I wouldn’t go into shock,” he says. “It’s kind of like when a little kid cuts his finger. He doesn’t start crying until he sees blood. I knew there was something wrong with my leg but I didn’t know what. I knew it might be horrific. I didn’t focus on it.” A version of this story originally ran in 2019; it has been updated for 2021."

In 2016, the Wisconsin Departments of Transportation and Natural Resources partnered with the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point to construct a tunnel beneath Highway 66, hoping to cut down on high turtle mortality rates,reportsRobert Mentzer for Wisconsin Public Radio. The tunnel, with Jordan Pond on one side and wetlands on the other, was a noble venture, but the turtles had no way of knowing it was a crossing point rather than a dark and potentially dangerous hole. So Pete Zani, herpetologist and associate professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, installed aluminum flashing outside of each opening, which would reflect the sky and let turtles know that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. Zani also installed grates above the tunnel to make it less shadowy, and a small cul-de-sac in a nearby piece of the fencing to encourage turtles who had missed the tunnel to turn around. This is a view of the tunnel. You can see how the sunlight shines through the grates they installed, and how aluminum flashing at the end of the tunnel shows the turtles that, yes, this passes all the way through.pic.twitter.com/oBIcNabfJN Zani and his team found that in the first year after construction, 85 percent fewer turtles were killed on the road, and no baby turtles were among the casualties. In the last few years combined, only 40 turtles died, compared to 66 deaths in 2015 alone. That’s great news for local turtles, of course, and it’s great news for local humans, too. The intersection in question is always busy with truckers, commuters, and families en route to Jordan Pond, and turtle crossing can exacerbate traffic congestion and increase the chance of accidents. Not all turtles have caught on, however, and it looks like some might never get the memo. Zani found that about 30 percent ofsnapping turtlesand 20 percent of painted turtles make it through the tunnel, and those numbers have been consistent each year since construction. “They either get it or they don’t,” Zani toldWisconsin Public Radio. Other animals are getting it, too. As part of the experiment, Zani set up a turtle-wrangling program in which students monitored trail cameras for turtle activity outside the underpass. In photos captured by the cameras, they noticed that rodents, mink, skunks, raccoons, and even house cats were traveling by turtle tunnel. [h/tWisconsin Public Radio]"

As theIndependentreports, London has elected to be the world's first-ever National Park City. The title National Park City may sound like an oxymoron; national parks are often natural areas protected from human development. But a new initiative from theNational Park City Foundationcalled the International Charter for National Park Cities (NPC) aims to apply many of the same qualities of national parks—like well-managed green spaces, clean air, and diverse wildlife—to the world's largest cities. On Monday, July 22,Mayor Khanannounced that London would be the first city to sign on. He said in atweet: ""A cleaner, greener London is central to my vision for our city—and we're taking bold action to ensure people, places are nature are better connected."" The main way city officials plan to achieve that goal is by adding more green space. London is already 33 percent green public space [PDF]. By connecting public parks, adding green roofs to existing buildings, and expanding private backyards and gardens, the city will work to achieve 50 percent green space by 2050. Not only would the new natural areas improve the quality of life of London's residents, but they would also support the city's animal population, which includes 15,000 species today. London is the first of what the National Park City Foundation hopes will be many cities to join the charter. The goal is to bring 25 cities on board by 2025, with Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Glasgow already in talks to gain National Park City status. [h/tIndependent]"

Well,according toNation's Restaurant News, California recently passed a law that will make it easier for customers to bring their own reusable containers to restaurants in order to bring food home with them while cutting down on waste. Previously, the standard policy at many restaurants in California was to decline taking outside containers (plastic storage, cups, etc.) into the kitchen to avoid cross-contamination. And those that did accept these containers would do so without clear guidelines from health departments. This new law, which was signed by governor Gavin Newsom in July, gives restaurants the choice to opt in to a safer, more regulated version of this practice. According to the bill, establishments that want to use containers provided by patrons are under no legal obligation to clean them, and containers should ideally be filled someplace separate from the kitchen's serving surface. If they need to be filled on the same surface used for serving and food prep, the area should be sanitized immediately afterwards. Restaurants should also have a policy for preventing cross-contamination available to health inspectors in writing. The law doesn't force restaurants to use foreign takeout containers if they don't want to. Rather, it gives businesses the option to follow more official guidelines about how reusable containers from customers can be implemented safely. In addition to leading to new to-go policies at restaurants, the bill could also change the way food stands at festivals and other events operate. Before, health codes requiredtemporary foodservicesites to stick to disposable plates and utensils, but under the new law, reusable items will be allowed as long as they're cleaned on site or at an approved facility.

So when you’ve forgotten yoursolar-powered water bottleand are trying to decide between buying a beverage bottled or canned, which should you choose? When it comes to the resources and processes required for producing plastic bottles and aluminum cans, they’re pretty much tied at “terrible,”according toLifehacker. Plastic bottles are derived from the non-renewable resource petroleum, also known as oil. You might have seen a commercial where some poor animal iscovered in oilfrom an oil spill—that’s just one of its negative effects. Oil drilling itself can also wreck water and land ecosystems, andfrackinguses tons of water and also releases methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Aluminum, on the other hand, is made from a rock called bauxite. Mining bauxite can devastate ecosystems, generate air and water pollution, and cause health issues for the surrounding communities. When it comes to the recycling prospects of each receptacle, aluminum cans have the edge. Since plastic bottles are so thin, they can’t be recycled into more plastic bottles. Instead, their fibers are used in things like carpeting, clothing, and sleeping bags. Plus, people don’t recycle plastic bottles as often as you might think:Recycling Todayreportedthat the national recycling rate for plastic bottles in 2017 was just 29.3 percent. Meanwhile, aluminum canscanbe recycled back into new aluminum cans, and the Aluminum Association, an industry group,estimatesthat almost 75 percent of all aluminum ever produced is still in use. Aluminum cans are recycled more often than plastic bottles, too—the rate for 2016 was about50 percent. Overall, both aluminum and plastic are bad for the environment.

Students pick up tablets instead of textbooks, and virtual courses have supplemented live lectures. And if you want to reach people, social media has become the way to do it. Which is why a Massachusetts oak tree is now live-tweeting its observations on everything from the weather to the color of its leaves. In a detailed and wonderful piece forAtlas Obscura, writer Jessica Leigh Hester relates how the tree came to tweet. The 85-foot-tall northern red oak is located in Harvard Forest, a 4000-acre outdoor research property owned by Harvard University and located in Petersham, Massachusetts. Tim Rademacher, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard and Northern Arizona University, wanted to reach people with a unique way of expressing the tree's experiences in response to environmental changes, so he equipped the tree with a series of sensors that can provide real-time data on its moisture level, sap flow, and fluctuations in the trunk and branches, among other measurements. Using this information, the@witnesstreeaccount fires off near-daily observations in a first-person (or first-tree) account of life as a stationary living organism. My trunk and branches are on the fast track! My trunk has grown 0.256 mm and my branches 0.278 mm so far this month. This year, my trunk has grown roughly 1.5 mm (0.06 inches) in diameter. In mid-summer, my growth begins to slow. The ""late wood"" rings I am producing now look darker, and contain more carbon, than my faster-growing ""early wood"" rings. Researchers involved in the project are adopting the voice of a tree to make the information feel more immediate, though they’re careful not to infer “feelings.” Usually, the tweets are based on data collected and compared to information stored by the Harvard Forest archive. When the tree tweets on July 21 that it was the “24th hottest day I remember,” its remembrance is based on fact: The Forest archive stretches back 55 years. When the tree seems to complain a bit about a heat wave, it’s because researchers can monitor the flow of sap, which is affected by water and temperature. Rademacher envisions a future where other areas like mountains or regional trees are monitored and offer similar observations. All of them experience the same environmental changes we do—and now, thanks to Rademacher and his team, they can have a voice, too. [h/tAtlas Obscura]"

According toThe Takeout, you can save money and reduce waste by washing and reusing plastic Ziplocs in some cases, but in others, using the plastic bag more than once can get you sick. When deciding whether or not to keep a used Ziploc in your kitchen, think about what you used it for in the first place. If it was used to store or marinade raw meat, eggs, or seafood, you should toss it in the trash. These products can contain dangerous pathogens in their uncooked state, and no matter how well you scrub the bag afterwards, there's no way to be sure you sanitized the bag completely. If you filled the bag with products that are safe to eat and touch as they are—like baked goods, clean produce, sandwiches, etc.—it should be safe to use a second time. This rule doesn't apply to bags that have holes, tears, or look worn out in general. For used bags that held safe foods and are still in good shape, Ziploc recommends hand-washing them and drying them thoroughly. Once they're clean, they're about as safe to eat out of as a reused plastic container. If you want to reuse the bag multiple times, just be aware that most sealable bags are made to be disposed of eventually, and it will likely develop wear and tear.

According to a new report on water quality at 4523 beaches across the United States, more than half demonstrated potentially unsafe levels of bacteria for at least one day in 2018. The main culprit? Fecal contamination. If that makes you feel like packing up your beach umbrella and towels, there are some caveats to keep in mind. The report [PDF] was prepared by Environment America Research and Policy Center, which examined the water quality of beaches in 29 states and Puerto Rico in 2018 using data collected by local, state, and federal agencies. Of the sites evaluated, 2620 were considered unsafe to swim in for at least one day. Six hundred and five sites were unsafe on 25 percent of the days that samples were collected. The determination was made by examining bacteria levels according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s threshold, or Beach Action Value (BAV). That guideline specifies contamination as being unsafe if levels could conceivably make 32 out of 1000 swimmers ill. The triggering element? Poop. Specifically, bacteria from fecal matter that’spresentin water as a result of storm runoff from urban areas. The rainwater can pick up bacteria from yards or streets and flow into water; sewage leaks can also be at fault. Germs likeEscherichia coliorEnterococcusseep into the water and can then be introduced to swimmers' gastrointestinal systems when they swallow water, causing illness. The bacteria can also prompt skin infections or respiratory disease. In Florida, 180 of 263 beach sites tested exceeded the BAV limits. In New York, 276 of 422 sites were deemed unsafe for at least one testing day. Environment America recommends increased federal oversight that can provide same-day testing and post water quality warnings when appropriate, as well as bring older sewage systems up to date. Naturally, not everyone agrees with the report’s conclusions. Officials in Maine, for example, which had water quality issues at roughly half of 85 sampled sites,respondedto the findings by saying 93 percent of their samples collected in 2018 were below the approved threshold for safe recreation and that97.2 percentof beach days were free from any contamination advisories or closures. Maine and other states often have a higher threshold for bacteria before waters are deemed unsafe. In Maine’s case, it’s 104 colony-forming units (CFUs) of enterococcus bacteria per 100 milliliters of water, higher than the blanket 60 CFUs of the Beach Action Value. There’s not necessarily a “wrong” number, as the EPA approves of both. Maine officials also argued that tested sites would have higher numbers shortly after heavy precipitation. Anyone concerned about swimming in public beaches should beawareof recent rainfall that could lead to increased urban runoff, which could result in more bacteria in the water. Swimmers should also avoid swallowing water, and make a habit of showering after going to the beach. [h/tForbes]"

207,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/596334/storm-chaser-secrets,,"Every year, people around the world board up windows, stock up on essential supplies, and flee their own homes in anticipation of severe weather events. But for storm chasers, tumultuous weather is an invitation to move toward the danger. Some endure precarious conditions during hurricanes, tornadoes, and other storms in order to take readings that might later prove useful to meteorologists. Others are simply attracted to the beauty of the storms, capturing nature’s violent expressions in what could be considered an extreme form of landscape photography. There's no shortage of opportunities for storm chasers. The U.S. each year sees an average of1253tornadoes—a massive column of spinning airborneout of thunderstorms and creating winds up to 250 miles per hour. Hurricanes arefueledby heat from oceans and threaten coastal regions with heavy rain and wind. Though it doesn’t have quite the same reputation, even a simple, raging thunderstorm can produce enough hail and high winds to cause chaos. Each is dangerous, devastating—and, in the eyes of storm chasers, beautiful. To better understand what motivates these individuals to seek out cataclysmic events, Mental Floss spoke to three extreme weather specialists. Here’s what they had to say about airborne houses, armored trucks, and why you won’t usually see any of them wearing a helmet. With just 13 hurricaneshittingthe continental U.S. since 2010, chasing hurricanes requires a passport and a willingness to spend days making connecting flights to international destinations. As a result, hurricane hunters are a small subgroup of the storm chaser demographic. Why do they do it? ForJosh Morgerman, a hurricane chaser based in Southern California and star of the Science Channel’s upcomingHurricane Man, being exposed to hurricanes on Long Island in his youth created an association between a severe storm and excitement. “My whole life is hunting that feeling again and again,” he tells Mental Floss. While he still pursues that rush, Morgerman's chief objective is to measure air pressure and log observational data that can assist meteorologists in analyzing storms. (Chasers can also measure factors like humidity, wind speed, and temperature.) Unlike tornadoes, which have a very clear visual identity as they spin in a cone shape over land, hurricanes just look like a fierce concentration of weather. That combination of heavy rain, wind, and flying debris can be hard to explain unless you’ve experienced it firsthand. As fierce weather rages in the area known as the eyewall, the eye, or center, inside is peaceful. Morgerman says that jarring contrast is a little like an acid trip. “In a severe hurricane [the eyewall] is quite incredible,” he says. “Some sound like a train or like wolves howling. Hurricane Michael, the building I was in was shaking. The windows were breaking. With storms like that, you can’t see anything. Everything just turns white. You just see flying wreckage. It’s an unbelievable spectacle to behold."" In the eye, though, ""It gets calm. The sky is blue ... There’s something very acid-trippy about that.” In 1996’sTwister, Bill Paxton plays a tornado chaser who braves a series of severe weather events. For many chasers, the movie was a milestone, prompting a lot of people to get into the field themselves. “It’s the reason I got into it,” says tornado chaserGreg Johnson, who now collects footage to sell to news outlets. “There was this romantic notion of storm chasing. There are a lot of things the movie got right."" There was one exception. ""One thing it didn’t get right is the human toll. The damage associated with these storms. The movie underplayed the destruction and death. In real life scenarios, it’s far worse than anything they show in the movie.” A chaser’s first priority, he says, is to stop and help anyone who might need assistance. The life of any storm chaser is supposed to be thrilling, and it is—for a few minutes or hours at a time. Most chasers spent the majority of their careers traveling toward a storm, either by driving toward it or, in Morgerman’s case, flying. He might be in a hurricane for hours; a tornado might touch down for just a few minutes. Johnson also says he spends much of his time traveling. “When you see videos on YouTube of incredible tornado events, recognize what you’re seeing is the 1 percent of the time,” Johnson tells Mental Floss. “You’re not seeing countless hours at truck stops sleeping on the hood of a truck doing nothing.” Severe weather can cause high winds and flooding, but it’s not always nature that winds up being physically threatening, especially because chasers spend so much of their time traveling. (In fact, there’s been only one fatal incident as a direct result of a tornado, when chaser Tim Samaras, his son Paul, and colleague Carl Young weretrappedin their vehicle and picked up by 200 mile-per-hour winds during the El Reno tornado in 2013. All three died.) According to Montana-based storm chaser and National Weather Service meteorologistCory Mottice, experienced chasers know to fear traffic more than the weather. “In a more highly populated area, you have to worry about traffic congestion,” he says. “A storm might be coming down through Oklahoma and you might be out of danger initially. But as the storm is getting closer, people are worrying and start panicking. They’ll pull under overpasses and get stuck on the road with a tornado coming at them.” Johnson agrees, adding that injury from storms can often take a back seat to traffic accidents. “The thing that keeps me up at night is the driving, not the tornado,” he says. “The tornado will generally go from point A to point B along a defined path. It’s very well-behaved. The quickest way is a straight line. It’s very visual. You can see where it is and you can avoid it. Driving is a completely different story. Put enough miles on and you’re bound to see a bad accident.” Driving in pursuit of a tornado requires a little more than simple guts and a willingness to get close to a massively powerful weather event. Chasers need their version of a Batmobile. According to Johnson, professionals usually opt for an armored truck to help insulate them from the destructive power of the storm. “We’re not just driving around in a pick-up truck,” he says. “I have a roll cage to prevent it from being crushed. It’s designed to go off-road. It’s heavier than a normal truck. The steel roll cage adds weight. There’s exterior coating to prevent punctures in the vehicle.” While the roll cage is heavy, the goal isn’t to make the vehicle heavier so it's harder for a tornado to pick up. “At the end of the day, if you’re caught in a tornado capable of throwing the vehicle, a weight difference of 500 or 800 pounds won’t matter. Tornados can pick up combiners. Those things do happen. I’d rather the truck be lighter and easier on gas.” Storm chasers don’t want to drive directly into a tornado or other severe weather event. They just want to get close enough to obtain readings or to take photographs. Johnson tries to get within 200 or 300 yards to snap photos, which is still close enough to see how intense wind speeds can be. “I’ve seen a house flying through the air,” he says. “I saw a truck flying across the road 50 yards in front of me.” Most chasers hit the road with doppler radar, laptops, cameras, and other equipment to help them analyze data and capture images. If you’ve wondered how they can do that without putting themselves at risk, the answer is simple. For still photography, Mottice puts the camera on a tripod outside while he remains in the truck. That keeps him out of danger—but his equipment is another story. ""I have my camera and gear on a tripod. I’m in the vehicle taking remote pictures. The hail can hit the camera. Wind is an issue.” Some chasers bring back-up equipment in case their gear gets pummeled. With flying wreckage cutting through the air, it would stand to reason storm chasers should equip themselves with helmets. Few do, however. “I’m embarrassed to say I don’t wear a helmet,” Morgerman says. “Fans have been pushing me to wear one for years … the whole [television] crew is wearing helmets. I don’t want anything to encumber the experience.” An experienced chaser knows how to plan routes that keep them safely away from tornadoes. For hurricanes, they scope out buildings able to withstand the force of the storm. All that planning, however, doesn’t mean they always walk away unscathed. Morgerman says the violent winds of a hurricane’s eyewall can leave enduring effects. “The intense gustiness can cause rapid pressure changes that can really hurt your ears,” he says. Most people assume hurricanes and tornadoes represent the pinnacle of danger when it comes to storm-chasing. But according to Mottice, a severe thunderstorm can match or exceed them in destructive power. “Some people think a severe thunderstorm warning with 80 mile-per-hour winds is no big deal, that the tornado is the big deal,” he says. “But winds produce more damage than some tornadoes. In Montana, a storm produced 120 mile-per-hour winds. They can do a lot of damage.” Mottice also tends to be wary of hail during storms. Once, he says, “I didn’t know a storm was blowing up behind the one we were chasing. We got caught in the core of that one. It threw golf ball-sized hail on us. The vehicles on the roads had broken windows.” In the storm-chasing community, there’s much debate over what separates a professional from an amateur. Generally speaking, professional storm chasers get paid for their work, whether that be compensation for footage or photography. But there's no licensing necessary to chase a storm, and anyone can pursue extreme weather. Morgerman, who has likely been in more hurricanes than anyone alive—he says the Science Channel verified the claim for his television series—believes amateurs who follow chasers on social media might get the wrong idea. “I remember being a 15-year-old weather nerd wanting to have these experiences. I worry I’m setting a bad example. I worry some kids will watch what I do and try to do it but without the experience and knowledge that I have.”"

Forest coverage in the east African nation has dropped from approximately 35 percent in the early 1900s to just 4 percent in the 2000s. Ethiopians have made significant strides toward improving those numbers by planting 350 million trees in one day, which Ethiopian officials believe is a new world record, theBBCreports. On July 29, volunteers from across the country got together with the goal of sowing 200 million seedlings before the day's end. Certain public offices were closed Monday so government employees could participate. Representatives from the United Nations, the African Union, and foreign embassies in Ethiopia took part in the project. After 12 hours, officials in charge of counting the seedlings confirmed that the planters had exceeded their initial goal: The country ended up planting 350 milliontreeson Monday, breaking the previous record of66 millionset by 1.5 million volunteers in India in 2017. The initiative was part of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's Green Legacy campaign, which aims to plant a total of 4 billion native trees in Ethiopia between May and October. On a local scale, the trees will improvesoil qualityand reduce the impact of flooding in the erosion-prone country. The benefits of the new trees also extend beyond the nation's borders. A single tree can absorb up to48 poundsof carbon dioxide per year and sequester 1 ton of the greenhouse gas by the time it's 40 years old.

But PepsiCo, which produces the LIFEWTR and Aquafina water brands, is looking to change that. The company recentlyannounceda new strategy that would reduce its use of plastics and ultimately wean consumers off bottles entirely, turning them on to sipping water from aluminum cans instead. According toThe Takeout, Pepsi says it plans tochangehow its water is packaged in significant ways begining in 2020. The LIFEWTR brand will use plastic bottles, but the company plans to source those containers from 100 percent rPET, orrecycledpolyethylene terephthalate. Its bubly sparkling water line, meanwhile, will be sold in cans, rather than in both bottles and cans, as it currently is. So will Aquafina, one of the leading bottled water brands, though it will initially be offered in cans only at food service establishments while the company tests retail preferences. If all goes well, retail consumers will eventually be able to buy Aquafina in cans, too. Such alterations would make for sweeping changes to the bottled water business, which hasexplodedin recent years. In 2016, the average American drank 39.3 gallons of packaged water per capita, edging out soda’s 38.5 gallons. The move to cans stems in large part from consumer habits. Over half of all beer andsoda cansare recycled compared to just 31.2 percent ofplastic bottles. PepsiCo expects the changes will result in saving more than 8800 tons of virgin plastic and 12,125 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The company is looking to make all of itspackagingrecyclable, compostable, or biodegradable by 2025. [h/tThe Takeout]"

The site of the 1986 accident that blew open the core of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and flooded the surrounding area with radiation is a tourist attraction today. The HBO miniseriesChernobylhas made the spot more popular than ever, and rather than discourage the public's fascination with the disaster, Ukraine is deciding to embrace it. AsCNN Travelreports, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky issued a statement declaring the 1000-square-mile exclusion zone around Chernobyl to be an official tourist destination. ""We must give this territory of Ukraine a new life,"" Zelensky said in hisdecree. ""Until now, Chernobyl was a negative part of Ukraine's brand. It's time to change it. Chernobyl is a unique place on the planet wherenaturerevives after a global man-made disaster, where there is a real 'ghost town.' We have to show this place to the world: scientists, ecologists, historians, tourists."" In order to boost Chernobyl's profile as a tourist attraction, the Ukrainian government will take steps to make it more accessible to the public. These will include establishing a ""green corridor"" that acts as a safe entry point into the area, and building new paths and checkpoints as well as renovating old ones. Pointless restrictions—such as rules against takingphotos—will also be done away with. Tours that take visitors through Chernobyl exist today, but they're much more complicated than a walk through theLouvre. Tourists must receive special permission to visit in advance, stick to approved routes, and undergo radiation screenings at various checkpoints. Despite the precautions required, tourism has exploded in the area by35 percentsince HBO'sChernobylminiseries premiered earlier this year.

Starting August 20, the airport will become the first in the country to ban single-use plastic water bottles. The city passed an ordinance in 2014 stating that no plastic water bottles could be sold on city-owned property, including the airport. Since the vendors have had several years to prepare, SFO spokesman Doug YakeltoldtheSan Francisco Chroniclethat there hasn’t been much opposition to the ban. The airport also started installing filtered water dispensers throughout the premises back in 2011—there are now more than 100, with plans to add even more. The ban does not extend to flavored water or any other bottled beverages, and flight attendants will continue to serve regular bottled water on the airplanes themselves. However, Yakel hopes that this initial phase of the plastic prohibition will prove successful and generate a broader ban. “Our hope is that migration will continue, where it’ll touch sodas and teas and juices and other flavored beverages,” he said. “Will this be the last change? Hopefully not.” The airport’s master plan is to bring their net carbon emissions and energy use level to zero and eliminate most landfill waste by 2021. To help accomplish this, SFO has asked its vendors to switch to compostable products for single-use foodware, like to-go containers, condiment packets, straws, and utensils. Michael Levine, CEO of Tastes on the Fly, which oversees airport vendor Napa Farms Market, told theSan Francisco Chroniclethat those new requirements are much easier to abide by than the plastic water bottle ban, mostly because there are more suppliers offering compostable foodware alternatives than plastic-bottle alternatives these days. According to theSan Francisco Chronicle, most SFO vendors are still currently selling plastic water bottles, so it remains to be seen how exactly the ban will take effect—if vendors will opt to stock their shops with non-plastic bottles, or if they’ll forgo offering plain water bottles altogether and let travelers fend for themselves. Hudson News, at least,plansto sell water in glass bottles and aluminum cans (which are marginallybetterfor theenvironmentthan plastic bottles). As for those who fail to comply by August 20, there’s no definitive penalty plan. Yakel said they’re “hopeful that this won’t be necessary.” And if you haven’t already, now might be a good time to invest in a reusable water bottle—check outthis one, which runs on solar power and reminds you to hydrate.

These pathogen-ridden arachnids latch onto their hosts for a blood buffet while transmitting a variety of diseases through their bites. Typically, ticks in infested areas wait for their hosts to stand or pass by and hope a bare leg presents itself. But not all ticks are so passive. In the Netherlands, there have beenreportedsightings ofHyalomma marginatum, a kind of Andre the Giant of ticks that are twice the size of a more common species,Ixodes ricinus(sheep tick). Worse, they don’t sit idle. If they want to bite you, they’ll run after you. The non-native species has been spotted twice in the past month. One was in Drenthe, a province in the northeastern part of the country, and the other wasfoundin Achterhoek. They measure up to 0.2 inches but can grow to 0.7 inches when engorged with the blood of their hosts. The ticks are known to hide in brush. When they spot a potential meal, they run toward it.H. marginatumcan detect a victim from up to 30 feet away and track it for 10 minutes before abandoning pursuit. The species is typically found in northern Africa and Asia as well as parts of southern and eastern Europe. How did they get to the Netherlands? Researchers theorize they hitchhiked on migratory birds. And while their appearances have been scarce, they’re still a cause for concern.H. marginatumis known to harbor the virus that causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which lists uncontrolled bleeding among its undesirable symptoms.

Uday Shetty, the operations director of DSM Engineering Plastics, explained toThe Straits Timesthat after they remove the out-of-use nets from the water, they clean, granulate, and transport them to their facilities in Pune, India. There, the deconstructed nets will undergo a strict quality check before being manufactured into eco-friendly surfboards.

In addition to getting caught in the nets, fish sometimes consume pieces of them; and since there’s always a bigger fish, the bits of plastic continue to work their way up the food chain. The nets also snag boat propellers, which can damage their engines. As mentioned in a DSMpress release, experts estimate that there are around 640,000 tons of the nets in the ocean, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of all ocean plastic waste. “We look beyond society’s current model of take-make-dispose and instead try to mimic nature and the circle of life,” Matt Gray, a commercial director for DSM Engineering Plastics, said in the press release. By transforming the nets into fins, fin boxes, SUP pumps, and other parts of surfboards, the nets can return to the ocean in a much more environmentally conscious way. And the benefits of the project aren’t limited to the ocean—it also creates an employment opportunity for the surrounding villagers.

But if the policy of a major hotel chain catches on, those goods may soon be gone. Last week, InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG)announcedthat it would be banning the distribution of these “bathroom miniatures” in all 5600-plus of its hotels in 2021. That would mean 843,000 guest rooms under brands like Holiday Inn will no longer carry elf-sized personal care items. The decision is part of an effort to reduce the use of plastics, amovementthat has seen plastic straw bans in restaurant chains and in cities like Seattle.

Native to Africa, these long-necked animals are thetallestto dwell on land, stretching up to 18 feet in height. But such a spectacular sight has become less and less common, as their populations have dwindled by nearly 40 percent since 1985. Roughly 97,000 giraffes remain in the wild—a number that might soonpromptthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to officially declare them an endangered species. According toSmithsonian.com, the giraffe population has been under duress for some time. Encroachment from developed areas has reduced their habitable environment, and poachers have also contributed to their shrinking numbers. Some hunters kill the animal for meat, while others take the tail, which is perceived in some cultures as a status symbol. Theleatheris also used in fashion and accessories. In 2016, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which administers a world list of endangered species, put them at Vulnerable status, signaling a need to minimize their threats. In 2017, the Fish and Wildlife Service received a petition, signed by numerous environmental groups and activists, asking to investigate the animals' status. Now, the agency has agreed to evaluate the giraffe and consider action. The review process could last up to 12 months. If giraffes receive the endangered species classification, conservationists would receive federal funding to help curb incentives to kill the animals, including the import of its body parts for sale and distribution. Land encroachment is more difficult to monitor and would involve interfering in land deals and development. Why hasn’t their plight been more publicized? One theory is that giraffes are common sights in zoos, leading to a widespread belief they’re still thriving. Activists are also concerned the review process by the Fish and Wildlife Service could take longer than anticipated and have urged policymakers to act quickly.

218,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/582736/beavers-help-clean-polluted-waters,,"Beaversare a lot more impressive than you might think. These semiaquatic rodents canbuild damsas large as 2800 feet deep, thanks in part to their super sharp teeth and sturdy tails that keep them from tipping over while hauling heavy materials into the water. According toresearchfrom scientists at the UK-based University of Exeter, the animals could also potentially help clean up polluted waterways. Professor Richard Brazier and his colleagues studied the water quality at the site of a fenced-in area in southwest England, where a family of captive beavers has been living since 2011. The water flowed from nearby fields to a local river, where it deposited sediment while passing through 13 dams that had been built by the beavers. The reduced water flow—and the deep ponds that formed as a result of the dams—had a filtering effect. The beavers’ dams captured more than 100 tons of soil and other sediment that contained high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, both of which are bad for wildlife and human consumption. The runoff problem is also twofold: The erosion of soil on agricultural land has both economic and environmental consequences. Scientists suggest that the reintroduction of the Eurasian beaver to rivers could help curb some of this damage. These “ecosystem engineers,” as the animals are called in the University of Exeter study, were believed to have been hunted toextinctionin Britain by the 1500s. However, a colony was found in Scotland a decade ago, and there have been some efforts since then to release beaver populations into the wild. ""It is of serious concern that we observe such high rates of soil loss from agricultural land, which are well in excess of soil formation rates,” Brazier said in astatement. “However, we are heartened to discover that beaver dams can go a long way to mitigate this soil loss and also trap pollutants which lead to the degradation of our water bodies. Were beaver dams to be commonplace in the landscape we would no doubt see these effects delivering multiple benefits across whole ecosystems, as they do elsewhere around the world."" In a separate study from 2015, scientists at the University of Rhode Islanddeterminedthat larger beaver ponds were able to remove up to 45 percent of nitrogen in the water that passed through them, while smaller ponds removed roughly 5 percent. The North American beaver was also on the brink of extinction in the 1800s, but these populations have since rebounded in Rhode Island andother partsof the continent."

Here’s how it works: You glue the broken shell back together, then glue the bra clasps to either side of the crack, and then wind wire around the clasps to ensure that the shell is held in place. It's like setting a human bone, Jennifer Gordon, director of Carolina Waterfowl Rescue, toldCNN.

For theirstudy, recently published in the journalEnvironmental Research Communications, a team of researchers studied the rings of trees in North Carolina's Black River swampland to learn more about climate history in the eastern United States. Bald cypresses are known to have impressive lifespans, but after analyzing specimens in the Black River's Three Sisters Swamp, an area that's notable for its long-lived trees, the scientists discovered that cypresses can grow to be even older than previously believed. The 2624-year-old cypress tree they found predates theGreat Wall of Chinaand the Roman Empire. Other remarkably old trees, including a 2088-year-old cypress, were also identified in the same grove. The North Carolina cypresses are old, but there are other types of trees that can grow to be much older. Clonal tress are genetically identical plants that reproduce asexually from a single ancestor.Old Tjikko, a clonal tree in Sweden, has a root system that dates back 9550 years. Despite all that North Carolina's bald cypress trees have endured, their lives are under threat. The swamp where the 2624-year-old tree stands is located just 6.5 feet above sea level, which means that floods driven by climate change could damage its habitat. And though the grove is in a protected area, industrial runoff and logging that's happening nearby could impact the trees' health. North Carolina is considering establishing a Black River State Park where the trees grow to further protect the ancient natural wonders. [h/tLive Science]"

Companies likeUnbound Merinospecialize in what they call travel clothes—items made of heavy-duty fibers like wool and designed to be washed infrequently. (Icebreaker, a New Zealand-based outdoor clothing company, encourages users to wear its merino woolTech-Lite shirtsfor up to a week between washings.) Another company,Pangaia, makes clothing out of cotton and seaweed fibers and treats them with peppermint oil, a natural antibacterial agent, to keep them fresh between washings. These materials tend to let bodies breathe, reducing the chance of trapping sweat and letting odor-causing bacteria linger. Unbound Merino chooses a light, thin wool fabric that mimics the feel of a cotton T-shirt. The idea is to design apparel that comes in handy for traveling, since finding places to launder clothing can sometimes be difficult, especially if you’re backpacking or far from hotel amenities. But the ambition is also to create more eco-friendly attire. Fewer washes means less water used. One question remains: Can the companies overcome decades of aggressive marketing from detergent companies about washing clothes regularly? For some, it will come down to the sniff test.

The new bill, which was recently approved by the state legislature and signed into law by Governor Tim Walz, sets aside a yearly budget of $900,000 to be used to help state residents convert their lawns into bee sanctuaries. The program specifically aims to boost the rusty patched bumblebee, a pollinator native to the Midwest whose population has declined by87 percentin the past two decades. When the law goes into effect, homeowners will be able to apply for financial assistance to plant their bee-friendly lawn, with 75 percent of the cost being covered for most projects and up to 90 percent being provided in areas especially suited to rusty patched bees.

A new study has demonstrated that shrimp found in bodies of water in rural Suffolk are consistently testing positive for cocaine as well as other controlled or prohibited substances. Researchers at King’s College London and the University of Suffolk published thepaperin the journalEnvironment Internationalafter taking samples from 15 different locations across five river catchments in Suffolk. Drugs like cocaine and ketamine were found in the shrimp, along with pesticides and other micropollutants. Researchers also found lidocaine, a local anesthetic used to “cut” cocaine. The levels are low, researchers say, but potential damage to these tiny Tony Montanas will need to be assessed with further study. This research does raise the question of how shrimp are testing positive for illegal drugs in the first place. When a human ingests drugs, their urine can contain trace metabolites that enter the wastewater system. One theory is that nearby wastewater treatment plants have discharged this type of contaminated waste into the Suffolk's rivers, though their filtration processes should prevent pharmaceuticals or their metabolites from getting through. It’s possible that sewer overflow or improper system connections are to blame. While the shrimp don’t appear to be affected, that hasn't been true of all animals.

229,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/569620/stelle-illinois-doomsday-disciples,,"In the early 1970s, people in the rural farming community of Cabery, Illinois, looked on with curiosity at what was happening in the cornfields surrounding their town. Ranch-style houses beganpopping upwhere stalks once grew, and began spreading out far enough to form street blocks. Plastic and paper factories were being erected. Well-dressed men and women orbited the development. The newcomers' intentions were mysterious, leading locals to begin speculating that their new neighbors might be part of a religious cult, or even laboring to build spaceships. Some longtime residents were so disturbed by the new arrivals that they’d drive by and fire weapons in the vicinity, hoping to scare them off. But the people of Stelle, as the town came to be known (the word is German for ""the place""), wouldn’t be so easily rattled. They believed the end of the world was looming, and they were preparing accordingly. Community friction would pale in comparison to the earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions that would herald the dawning of a new civilization. As the rest of the world scrambled for resources, Stelle would manage its own water, sewage, and communications lines before relocating to a Pacific island—a sprawling collection of Adams and Eves who wouldsurvivethe end of the world, which they believed would arrive on May 5, 2000. The date was given to them by their leader,Richard Kieninger, a former engineer from Chicago who had prophesied the apocalypse and set them on a path of readiness. HepredictedStelle would grow to 10,000 inhabitants in just a few years. He was off by about 9800 people. Short, bespectacled, and soft-spoken,Kieninger was no one’s idea of a charismatic conductor of a new civilization. He evenrejectedhis role at times, insisting he never sought out such an important function as society's savior. Instead, he claimed, it had been bestowed upon him. In 1963, Kieninger wrote a book titledThe Ultimate Frontier, a quasi-autobiography published under the pen name Eklal Kueshana, in which he described being visited as a youth by a “Brotherhood” of scientists and philosophers who instructed him to prepare for pending calamities by erecting a self-reliant society that observed the Golden Rule. For good measure, they branded his thigh with their symbol. (Kieninger would later decline to show journalists proof of his marking.) Readers ofThe Ultimate Frontier, though few in number, embraced Kieninger’s message. By 1973, he and several others had pooled $169,000 to buy 320 acres of farmland in rural Illinois, roughly 85 miles south of Chicago. The flat, remote area seemed like an ideal place to wait out the pending chaos; Kieninger claimed he was told by the Brotherhood to focus his efforts there. Residential housing and a water treatment plant were among the first construction jobs. Next came schools, sewage treatment facilities, and phone lines. (Stelle would eventually fight a nine-year court battle to have their own independently-operated telephone service separated from the major carriers.) Would-be residents idled in adjacent neighborhoods, waiting for an opportunity to join the community. Space wasn’t the sole determining factor of Stelle citizenship. Kieninger didn’t actively recruit anyone: He had a pool of interested parties who had read his book, then sifted through them to see if they met the requirements for his budding utopia. Residents had to be at least 21 years old with some background in business, as Stelle would have to generate its own economy through entrepreneurial efforts. He turned away people he considered to be of less than sound psychological mind. He also required tithing of 10 percent, with the funds fueling the continued growth of the town. Kieninger said he accepted only about 25 percent of those who applied to become residents of Stelle. Once accepted, Stelle occupants were expected to follow the behavioral mandates laid out in Kieninger’s book. There would be no drinking or intoxicants of any kind; smoking would be prohibited if people nearby found it unpleasant; men were required to shave and wear business attire even if they labored in construction, switching to their work clothes on site; women could not wear pants. Mothers were instructed not to work, as raising a child was considered of paramount importance; they wereexpectedto offer one-on-one instruction for the first three years of a child's schooling. In return, Stelle's citizens embraced one another. Doors were kept unlocked and lost $20 bills were pinned to community bulletin boards. Children flourished, reading at age 3 and writing by age 4. As the 1970s wore on, Stelle blossomed, growing to house more than 200 residents and erecting solar-paneled buildings that would allow its citizens to thrive if electric services shut down in the wake of a collapsed society. Kieninger told curious journalists that Stelle would soon have its own self-contained shops and services, with residents walking into stores and putting items on credit to cut down on paper currency. Work was also moving along on airships that would relocate the community's entire population to a Pacific island when the natural disasters began. There was just one problem: While Stelle was a united community, their collective faith in Kieninger was starting to wane. Lacking the kind of fiery charisma seen in other coercive cult leaders, Kieninger held little sway over the residents he once enticed to the area. When arguments broke out over the future of Stelle, his community did what any self-sufficient neighborhood would do when faced with a prophet who couldn’t deliver any prophecies: They kicked him out. Kieninger’s departure from Stelle in 1975 was never explained in full.Some attribute it to a power struggle that broke out between Kieninger and his own wife, who remained in Stelle when Kieninger left to start a new community, Adelphi, in Texas. He returned to Stelle on a monthly basis for meetings as a kind of remote soothsayer before parting ways with them for good in 1986. In the interim, residents of Stelle had begun to abandon some of the tenets that had brought them there in the first place. When 1976 passed without Kieninger’s predicted economic strife, faith in him was shaken. Citizens balked at being deemedsurvivalistsor perceived as weird by their fellow Ford County residents. Building airships to transport them to new land wasgoing nowhere. Why, people wondered, couldn’t they just exist as a cooperative community without a looming sense of dread? So the behavioral requirements were largely dropped. There would be no more tithing. Instead, Stelle would focus itseffortson being a green community, expanding its use of solar energy, and using a 21-foot wind turbine for its water treatment plant. By 1997, only a third of Stelle's 100 or so occupants still believed in Kieninger’s teachings; another third were reformed; the rest lived there simply because they liked it. Today, Stelle is still on the map andpromotingits eco-friendly habits. There are cooperative groups for gardening, tool-sharing, and meal preparation. The community lays claim to a number of U.S. firsts, including the first solar-powered telephone company and the first solar-powered wireless internet service. The further they get from Kieninger’s predicted world demise on May 5, 2000, the more Stelle has distanced itself from its former identity as a doomsday sect. That’s fine by Kieninger, who never seemed totally comfortable with his appointed role as a prophet. After years had passed without calamity, he told a local newspaper that heralding the end of the world wasn’t as easy as it seemed. ""I’m getting kind of burned out trying to put a precise time on these things,"" he said."

Catalan regional interior minister Miquel Buch reported that authorities believe the manure was improperly stored on a chicken farm in the village of La Torre de l’Espanyol, where it was exposed to the worst of the heat, according to NBC News .  The wildfire—Spain’s most devastating in 20 years—is affecting the region just west of Tarragona, a port city that is best known for its Roman ruins , which is situated along the Balearic Sea about 60 miles southwest of Barcelona.

Though high temperatures are expected to continue and the rough terrain itself is also a contributing factor in the rapid spread of the fire, the strong winds should soon abate; authorities have warned people to stay inside. Though more than 50 people have been evacuated from the area, no deaths have been reported thus far.  While the spontaneous combustion of flammable materials like manure, hay, or compost is definitely possible , as evidenced by this situation, it’s not the most common way for wildfires to start. More common causes include lit cigarettes, unattended campfires, burning debris, and engine sparks."
232,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/582720/youre-probably-not-washing-your-reusable-water-bottle-enough,,"Carrying areusable water bottleis an economical and eco-friendly choice. By not lugging around one-time-use plastic bottles, you're reducing waste headed to landfills and saving money on water that flows freely from your tap. (Unless, of course, you own a home and have to pay the water bill.) Whether they're made of glass, have a filter, or come insulated, the bottles carry clear advantages over crates of packaged water. As beneficial as these bottles are, they tend to lull consumers into a sense of false security. Since only water goes in them, there's a pervasive feeling that they don't need to be washed often. Some users may not even wash them at all. AsReader's Digestcontributor Lisa Marie Conklin points out, that's not a good idea. Conklin spoke with microbiologist Miryam Z. Wahrman, Ph.D., a professor of biology at William Paterson University, to get some insight on why washing reusable bottles should be a habit. For one thing, Wahrman notes, people sipping from the nozzle frequently have traces of food in their mouth that can migrate to the bottle and the remaining water inside. Any germs in or around your mouth can also find their way into the supply. The next time you drink—an hour or a day later—you're consuming that potentially unfriendly bacteria. Those microbes can begin to proliferate in stagnant water, especially if it's left inside ahot car, in front of a sun-exposed window, or other places where a warm environment can contribute to their growth. Bottles can also pick up all the same germs transmitted by your hands during a typical day. To avoid contamination, it's best to wash your bottle daily with soap and water. Michigan State Universityadvisesfilling the bottle with water and dish soap and letting it soak for several minutes. It's also a good idea to empty the bottle if you're not going to be using it for extended periods. [h/tReader's Digest]"
233,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/582737/cleanyst-eco-friendly-home-personal-cleaning-products,,"While soaps and detergents are great at keeping your body and home clean, they aren't always a clean choice for the planet. Even if you buy in large quantities (which isn't always possible if you live in a small home with little storage space) and use refill packs instead of buying new plastic bottles every few weeks, liquid soaps, shampoos, cleaning solutions, and detergents are heavy and bulky, meaning they take a big carbon footprint to ship. A new company is trying to reduce the environmental impact of your cleaning routine by taking out the part of those products that make them so heavy—the water. TheCleanystsystem allows users to mix their own personal care and cleaning products at home by adding regular tap water to pre-packaged concentrates and blending them together in reusable bottles. The appliance, which just launched onKickstarter, acts kind of like a Keurig for soap—you pop a concentrate packet in the machine, then it heats up the water and mixes up the concentrate to create a ready-to-use soap, detergent, or shampoo. The process (which Mental Floss saw in action at an April 2019 demo) takes just the push of a button and a few minutes. Cleanyst is launching with six different home care products (dish soap, laundry detergent, fabric softener, all-purpose cleaner, glass cleaner, and tile/tub cleaner) and four different personal care products (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand soap) to start. The company eventually hopes to branch out into even more products, serving as a one-stop shop for all your cleaning and hygiene needs. The dye-free, plant-based concentrates are available in fragrance-free and naturally scented versions, or the company has aromatherapy concentrates that you can mix in to personalize the smell of your products. All of the formulas are vegan and are not tested on animals. Cleanyst isn't the only company trying to take the water out of cleaning products. For instance,Truman's, a direct-to-consumer cleaning product company launched earlier this year, ships concentrated cleaning solutions for counters, floors, glass, and bathrooms in pocket-sized cartridges. You just have to pop the cartridges into a spray bottle filled with water in order to dilute the mixture. Cleanyst's creators take that idea a bit further. It's relatively easy to mix a thin surface cleaning solution with water, but creating a more viscous soap from concentrate is much harder. In order to create thicker gel mixtures like hand soap and shampoo—and one day, lotion—Cleanyst uses an industrial mixing system similar to what's available in a laboratory. This means even the thick substances mix evenly with the water, which would likely be impossible to achieve by shaking it up by hand. Water comprises two-thirds or more of the weight of most home and body care products, and by shipping only concentrates, Cleanyst estimates that it can reduce single-use plastic by 80 percent. And while the concentrates are currently being shipped to users in light plastic pouches, the empty pouches can be mailed back to Cleanyst for recycling. By reducing shipping and packaging costs, the company is also able to pass on savings to customers—the products are all just a few dollars each, and Cleanyst estimates that the average user can save $150 a year by switching to its system. If you're buying shampoo, soap, laundry detergent, and other personal care products for a family, the savings could be significant over time. All of the home care products cost less than $3 per pouch, while the body wash pouches cost $5 and the shampoo and conditioner pouches cost $6 each. The kits come with 12-ounce and 16-ounce reusable plastic mixing bottles. (The system automatically dispenses personal care products in 12-ounce quantities and home cleaning products in 16-ounce quantities.) Users can either mix their products in Cleanyst's bottles then use the included spray and pump heads to dispense the final mixture, or use Cleanyst's bottles to mix the products and then transfer the solution to another reusable dispenser. Buy the Cleanyst systemonKickstarterstarting at $99 for the appliance itself, one 12-ounce bottle, one 16-ounce bottle, and two concentrate pouches of your choice.

Here’s how each of them made a real, tangible impact that's still being felt today. For nearly a quarter of a century, Frederick Wiseman’s unsettling 1967 documentary on the mistreatment of patients at Massachusetts's Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane was banned—supposedly in the interest of those patients' right toprivacy. Even though only a limited number of people saw the film between 1967 and 1991, it’s still credited with spurring the closure or reform of several major psychiatric hospitals. Plus, if Wiseman is to be believed, Bridgewater began usingTiticut Folliesas a training tool for employees on whatnotto do at work. Errol Morris tore into the evidence and testimony against Randall Dale Adams, a death row inmate accused of murdering a police officer, in this 1988 true crime documentary.

236,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/585070/michelin-has-created-puncture-proof-tire-prototype,,"Flat tires have long been the biggest plague facing motorists. In 2017, research conducted by auto experts AAAfoundthat 28 percent of new-model cars didn’t even come with a spare tire in the event of a tire failure, with manufacturers choosing to eliminate them to reduce costs and improve fuel efficiency. In 2016, the AAA estimated that it assisted 450,000 drivers with flats and repairs. Loss of air pressure or simply driving over a piercing object can blow out a tire, causing delays, accidents, and emergency stops into repair facilities. Tire manufacturer Michelin is looking to change that. In collaboration with General Motors, the company isworkingon a tire named Uptis (Unique Puncture-Proof Tire System) that doesn’t use air and cannot be rendered flat. The design, which would be the first airless tire system for passenger cars,debutedat this week’s Movin’ On Summit in Montreal. Though the tire has conventional treads, the middle layer ismadeof composite rubber and resin-embedded fiberglass spokes. The spokes provide support for the treads and remove the need for air. The two companies believe the Uptis will last longer than a regular tire because it cannot be worn down by being under or over-inflated. The design is also intended to be environmentally friendly, as it would reduce the number of tires thrown out due to damage. According to Michelin, 200 million tires are discarded every year. The tires will be tested in a fleet of Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles later this year. If the trial goes well, Michelin expects they could be available on new General Motors vehicles by 2024. It’s not yet clear whether Michelin would sell the tires separately or if vehicles might need some kind of modified chassis in order to accommodate them. [h/tWBTW]"

238,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/541659/nai-conservation-save-endangered-tapirs-rainforests-costa-rica,,"Costa Rican biologist Esteban Brenes-Mora was just 5 years old the first time he saw a tapir, and he immediately fell in love with the large, unusual animal. ""The tapir was walking on the beach close to Corcovado National Park,"" he says of the moment that helped impact his future career. ""It was a highlight for me; it led me to do what I do now."" Twenty-five years later, Brenes-Mora is a tapir expert and founder ofNai Conservation, a Costa Rican organization that is working to save the endangered species from its worst enemy: humans. Tapirs have been around for some 35 million years, but deforestation, highways through its habitats, and poaching have caused their numbers to drop significantly. It'sestimatedthat the population of the Baird's tapir as decreased by more than 50 percent in just the last three generations. And in turn, what hurts the tapirs hurts the environment. ""Tapirs are considered gardeners of the forests; they plant seeds and have a big impact on enriching the soil,"" Brenes-Mora explains. ""The tapirs are even saving us from climate change. There's evidence from the Amazon that when tapirs are gone from certain forests, carbon sequestration in those forests decreases."" Experts have warned that tapirs, and specifically the Baird’s tapir that Brenes-Mora saw on that beach as a child, may soon be classified as critically endangered if current trends are not addressed. Thankfully, Brenes-Mora has a plan. I’m in Costa Rica on assignment to create an awareness-building filmabout the endangered tapir species. My colleague Alisha and I have just wrapped one week documenting the work ofNai Conservation, the local tapir research and conservation organization Brenes-Mora founded in 2015, and we're putting the final touches on our film in one of the most heavily tapir-populated (and protected) habitats, Corcovado National Park. Of course, seeing a tapir in the wild would add an important element to our film, but even after a full week with the passionate, driven team behind Nai Conservation, we haven't seen even one. This isn't surprising, though; few locals ever encounter the elusive tapir. The Baird's tapir—Tapirus bairdii, or known locally asdantain Spanish—is one of four tapir species in the region. It's indigenous to Central America and is a mammalian relative of the rhinoceros and horse, though it looks much more hog-like than either of the two (it has no relation to either boars or pigs). It is largely nocturnal and spends most of its day resting, hidden in the rainforests before foraging for fruits and berries in the afternoon. This makes spotting one in the wild even more rare, but Brenes-Mora and the Nai team want us to see a tapir as badly as we do. Before launching Nai, Brenes-Mora spent six months in Malaysia after getting his biology degree, working withRIMBA, an NGO studying tigers, flying foxes, and other native wildlife. But since seeing that tapir on the beach when he was young, it had been his childhood dream to work with tapirs, and a fellowship with the Zoological Society of London gave him that chance. According to Brenes-Mora, thefellowshipsare meant to provide early-career conservationists and biologists an opportunity, through funding and mentorship, to get a foothold in their desired field. For him, that meant tracking tapirs through the highlands of Costa Rica's Talamanca Mountains. One day in 2015, Brenes-Mora and a friend reached Cerro de la Muerte—Costa Rica's ""mountain of death,"" the highest point on the mountain range. They were discussing creating a logo for the fellowship project, but Brenes-Mora’s friend saw longer-term potential. ""He was like 'whoa, you have more than a logo, you have more than a project, you can actually start something here,'"" Brenes-Mora remembers. And start something he did. The idea quickly evolved into the full-scale conservation project, Nai. (In the indigenous Bribri language of Costa Rica,naimeansdanta, ortapir.) Under Brenes-Mora's leadership, the organization is bringing together people with a variety of skills to raise awareness and preserve the tapir species. Nai's biologists and veterinarians perform critical, in-the-field research that informs tapir conservation action. The organization's teachers educate children on the tapir species as part of its ""Salva-Dantas"" program, which prepares youth for a lifetime of helping the tapir. And graphic designers and artists like Mauricio Sanabria, an artist who joined the team as a twentysomething in 2017, create eye-catching signs and other content to help spread the word about Nai—and ultimately the tapir—online and across local communities. Over the past four years, this seed of a project has grown into a grassroots movement. The team's bright yellow ""tapir crossing"" stickers—the symbol of support for Nai—are popping up in restaurants, homes, and businesses throughout the country. One delicious example is in Costa Rica's capital city of San José, where Lucía Cole and Mauricio Varela, thefoundersofTapir Chocolates, donate a portion of all profits to Nai. And all the way down in the southwestern-most Osa Peninsula some 200 miles away, two of Nai's biggest supporters, Steven Masis and Deyanira Hernández, plan to guide us through the jungle in search of a tapir. Masis and Hernández leadwildlife toursacross the tropical Osa Peninsula, including through the country's popular, secluded Corcovado National Park. Both in their early thirties and withbackgroundsin biology, Masis and Hernández join Nai and its partners on virtually all research trips through the remote, 160-square-mile park. Of all the places to spot tapirs in Costa Rica, Corcovado's dense, foggy rainforests—accessible only by boat or tiny plane—are the best bet. But even with their exceptional tapir-sighting success rate, these two activists don't take those sightings for granted. Any encounter with the endangered tapir is rare and special. Due to threats like poaching (its hide is highly valuable on the black market), habitat loss, road kills, and trafficking, populations are plummeting throughout its Central American habitat. At this point, Brenes-Mora estimates only 1500 tapirs remain in Costa Rica, and researchsuggeststhat the total population of Baird’s tapirs in the entire region is only around 3000. The possibility of losing the tapir species is problematic for planet Earth. The tapir holds a unique ecological ""superpower"" that’s becoming more important by the second: the ability to help combat climate change. They can eat over 200 pounds of fruit, plants, and seeds a day, and in the process, they essentially clear the forest floor, till the ground with their rummaging, and spread the seeds that they eat through transference and droppings. And they've been doing this for millions of years. Despite the challenges, the tapir movement is not all doom and gloom.Earlier that week, I joined Nai for an afternoon installing ""tapir crossing"" road signs in central Costa Rica's Cerro de la Muerte mountains, and saw several indicators of success throughout the day. For one, even erecting these street signs is progress. The team used trap-photo data and subsequent tapir and road traffic models to project exactly where traffic accidents occur most frequently, and they have used that data to convince the transportation department and local communities to allow tapir-crossing signs at high-risk sections along the busy Inter-American Highway, which runs right through tapir habitat. ""All of our decisions are based on actual data,"" Brenes-Mora says. ""Based on that data, we start making decisions and lobby to include our ideas into policy.” Brenes-Mora, a pragmatic biologist who has formed strong working relationships with key government leaders and NGOs, is hesitant to claim the decrease in road kills as a success just yet. A couple of years is not enough time to impact the population of a large mammal, he says (especially one with a 400-day gestation period for a single calf—repopulating the species will take a very long time). But four yearsisenough time to create a widespread, engaging movement among locals. From Brenes-Mora's perspective, this unity surrounding the tapir is the ultimate success. ""Without people, it doesn't matter if we have protected areas, it doesn't matter if we're protecting the populations,"" he says. ""Without engaging people, we won't be able to secure the species in the long term."" While Nai is his brainchild and tapirs are his lifeblood, Brenes-Mora doesn't want the future of Nai—or, more importantly, the tapir species—to depend solely on him. ""I'm always asking myself 'what will happen when I die?'"" he muses. ""I don't want tapirs to be unattended if something happens to me. I don't want to be the tapir guy, I want Nai to be the tapir group. I want all the members of the team to be the tapir people. It's hard to do that, but we're on the right track."" With the future in mind, Brenes-Mora is priming people like Nai research lead and team veterinarian Jorge Rojas, artist Mauricio Sanabria, and dozens of other dedicated team members to help carry the tapir mission forward. They tour and give talks, like at a recentweeklong eventthey hosted at the University of Costa Rica with the Costa Rica Wildlife Foundation, where Brenes-Mora and Rojas spoke at a symposium for students, professors, and activists about threats to tapirs, their importance to the environment, and how to best help and protect them. That's why our trip down to Corcovado National Park is a milestone for the movement—the plight of the tapir is generally less known than that of the whale or tiger or rhino. Raising awareness about the tapir is one of its best chances at survival. Alisha and I had originally plannedto take the two-day Corcovado trek on our own, but after some consideration (and likely Brenes-Mores's urging, given the rough terrain we'd be facing—i.e. jungle off-roading), Sanabria joined us for a chance to see the animal he's been working so hard to save. For all the work he has done as a researcher and activist and the time he's spent in the field, he has yet to see a tapir in the wild. Suddenly, our naturalist guide bursts from the forest yelling, ""Un tapir! Un tapir!,"" and Sanabria takes off running. Despite the fact that Masis and Hernández see tapirs more regularly than most, they're leading our 100-yard blitz down the beach with him—smiling their ""Christmas morning grins"" every step of the way. Finally, after much huffing and puffing, we've made it. We've caught up with our guides and are now face to face with the remarkable tapir we drove hundreds of miles to see. We're awestruck and on adrenaline highs, but the tapir couldn't be less interested in the five of us. He offers a polite nod between super-sized mouthfuls of vegetation, but he has business to attend to—like strolling along the shoreline, urinating in the ocean, and then passing out in the sun. Sanabria locks eyes with the now-sleepy tapir, and in a moment of near-solitude with the elusive creature, Sanabria can feel the magnitude of the work he's been doing. ""It's touching to finally see what you're working for,"" he says. ""It's a little sign of hope."""
239,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/579989/what-do-terms-on-energy-saving-light-bulbs-mean,,"There's a reason your parents used to scold you for not turning off a light when you left a room. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, an average American householdusesup to 5 percent of their total energy expenditure on lighting. Living rooms get flooded with light. Dining rooms and dens are full of lighting accents. Motion lights, hallway lights, bathroom vanity lights, lamps—we like our lives to be nice and bright. Fortunately, energy-saving lighting sources have largely replaced theconventionalincandescent bulbs that once used up a substantial amount of power. Those bulbs heated up a coil, or filament, of tungsten wire that gave off light. Roughly 90 percent of the energy they passed on was in the form of heat, which siphoned off energy and kept utility bills inflated. Today's bulbs brighten without the waste. That's the good news. The bad? The varieties of bulbs can be confusing. If you've ever been lost in the fixtures section of the hardware store, here's a quick primer on what these terms mean. These are incandescent light bulbs that contain a halogen gas-filled capsule around the filament to help increase energy efficiency. Whilecheaperto operate than a conventional incandescent bulb—they use 25 to 30 percent less energy—they don't produce as much of a cost savings as other options. On the plus side, they reach full brightness immediately. Other choices may take time to warm up. When you see a coiled light bulb, it’s likely to be a CFL, which is simply a downsized version of the tubular florescent lighting seen in commercial spaces. Instead of an electric current traveling through a filament like in an incandescent bulb, the current goes through a tubecontainingargon and mercury vapor. The resulting ultraviolet light activates phosphor inside the tube, which emits light. It uses one-third of the energy of a halogen incandescent. The downside? They can take a little time to warm up, especially if used outdoors. They also contain mercury, a potential health hazard if the bulb breaks. (See the ""mercury"" entry below.) This type of bulb uses a semiconductor to convert electricity into light. In addition to being energy-efficient, they usually last eight to 25 times longer than halogen incandescent bulbs and four to eight timeslongerthan CFLs—perhaps as long as 18 to 46 years. You'll probably pay more up front, but the expense is offset by their durability. Most LEDs are compatible with dimming switches, too. Most CFLs aren't, so if that's important to you, you'll want to stick with LED. A bulb with an Energy Star label wasevaluatedby a third party to make sure its energy-saving claims are accurate, and they'll typically have a longer warranty than bulbs without the endorsement. But what about the ""nutritional label"" style information box that appears on light bulb packaging? Let's take a closer look. You have probably inferred that brightness refers to the light output given off by a bulb. This ismeasuredin lumens and rounded off to the nearest five. (A bulb will never be 822 lumens. It's 820.) The higher the number, the brighter the bulb. Since you're probably used to shopping by wattage, consider that a bulb with 800 lumens is roughly the equivalent of a 60-watt incandescent. A 1100 lumen bulb will resemble a 75-watt bulb. This is a rough estimate of much it will cost an average household to operate the bulb. What's average? The wattage of the bulb is calculated with three hours of daily operation at a cost of 11 cents per kilowatt. Your actual cost will go up or down whether you use it more or less or pay your energy supplier a different amount. This is how long the bulb is expected to last based on the same usage estimated for the energy cost and rounded to the nearest tenth of a year. This refers to the color temperature of the bulb measured in Kelvin, a temperature scale measuring light color. The range is from 2600 K (yellow and warm) to 6600 K (blue and cool). Bright white is about 3500 K. You should probablyavoidanything above 3000 K for any interior room. This is how much energy the bulb will require and is measured in watts. The lower the wattage, the cheaper it costs to operate. This is where the energy savings materializes, as a 10-watt LED bulb may give off as much light as an old 60-watt incandescent. It's not on all bulb packaging, but if you see it, it refers to how accurate colors will appear under the bulb's light on a scale of 0 to 100. Halogen incandescent bulbs score high. CFLs and LEDs aren't quite as accurate, though they may still get the job done. Try to get a high CRI if you'll be using the bulbs in a bathroom, as skin tone can appear off with lower CRI numbers. You might see some CFL bulb packaging with a mercury disclosure. This isn't an issue if the bulb remains intact, but if it breaks, it mightreleasepotentially hazardous mercury vapor and the introduce the very small possibility of mercury poisoning. Avoid using CFL bulbs in kids' rooms if there's potential for knocking over a lamp or light. Broken bulbs that contain mercury should be cleaned up byfollowingEnvironmental Protection Agency guidelines—picked up with tape, not vacuumed—and disposed of properly. Old bulbs should be recycled."

We’re told to use canvas tote bags at the grocery store, but those come with anenvironmental catch. Even materials that seem like they’d be easy to recycle—likeyogurt containersandplastic bottle caps—can be a minefield of “do's” and “don’ts.” Further complicating matters, a new study has revealed that “biodegradable” plastic bags didn’t actually degrade after three years in the natural environment, according toThe Guardian. Researchers from the University of Plymouth in the UK tested four types of plastic bags marked as biodegradable and one conventional plastic bag as a control. Some of the biodegradable bag samples were buried in soil, some were left in open air, and others were submerged in seawater to represent conditions after the bags are thrown away by consumers. After nine months, the four biodegradable bags left in open air had disintegrated into plastic fragments; in seawater, only the bag type labeled compostable disintegrated completely. At the end of the study, all but the compostable bag were still able to hold 5 pounds of groceries after being submerged in soil or seawater. The findings werepublishedin the journalEnvironmental Science and Technology. Imogen Napper, the study's lead author, said she was shocked by the findings. “After three years, I was really amazed that any of the bags could still hold a load of shopping. For a biodegradable bag to be able to do that was the most surprising,” Napper said in astatement. “When you see something labeled in that way, I think you automatically assume it will degrade more quickly than conventional bags. But, after three years at least, our research shows that might not be the case.” My 3-year experiment is out today! This is a biodegradable plastic bag after 3-years in the marine environment, and it can hold a full bag of shopping. Biodegradable/compostable items do not necessarily break down quickly in natural environments like the ocean ?pic.twitter.com/LDucC4NucJ If you’re looking for a better alternative, compostable bags might be the way to go. Still, researchers concluded that none of the bags, including compostable ones, had deteriorated sufficiently enough to offset the negative effects of littering. Co-author Richard Thompson, who serves as head of the university’s International Marine Litter Research Unit, called for more consistent guidelines regarding what can be labeled as biodegradable. “Our study emphasizes the need for standards relating to degradable materials, clearly outlining the appropriate disposal pathway and rates of degradation that can be expected,” Thompson said.

While pollen is often associated with flowers, Durham’s pollen haze came from a variety of area trees, including pine, oak, and mulberry. During allergy season, trees have been known to drop massive “pollen bombs,” some of which contain up to a billion pollen grains. Gilchrist used a drone to photograph these “pollen clouds,” which hung in the air and blanketed everything in sight, including cars, porches, and the ground. ""It was surprising to see it up that high,"" Gilchrist, who has worked as a meteorologist, said while describing the green clouds toCNN.

AsUSA Todayreports, decades-old feces left behind by climbers could start thawing out as early as this summer due to climate change. Researchers say 66 tons of frozen poo has been dumped in snow pits or crevasses, according to estimates based on the average human “deposit.” That waste can eventually work its way downstream and end up on the surface of a glacier. Situated in Denali National Park, the mountain—formerly known as Mount McKinley—rises to an elevation of 20,310feetabove sea level. That makes removing the waste difficult, but climbers are starting to embrace more sustainable practices. Companies that arrange expeditions at Denali have voluntarily offered to make their clients pack up andcarrytheir own waste. Visitors were already required to carry their waste while climbing up the first 14,000 feet of the mountain, but the new measure would help protect the upper section of Denali as well. “Climbers and particularly guide services are really embracing the new policy and are even exceeding it,” Michael Loso, aNational Park Service(NPS) glaciologist, toldUSA Today. “It has become kind of an informal badge of merit to carry off all your waste.” Of course, the softening poo is representative of a much larger issue. Some of Denali’s glaciers are melting at a rate that is concerning. The NPS has used comparative photography to measure some of the glaciers andconcludedthat most of the ones they studied had “retreated, thinned, or stagnated.” Alaskan parks in general have also seen their ice-covered areas shrink by 8 percent in the last 50 years. “We have lost more glacier cover in the Alaskan national parks than there is area in the whole state of Rhode Island,” Loso said.

They hide amid rocks and they're mostly active at night, which makes them hard to spot in the wild. The hellbenders' numbers have shrunk in recent decades.

Dams,construction, fishing, and reduced dissolved oxygen levels in their native waters may also be hurting them. Today they're considered endangered in Maryland, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana.

But people have a popular, alternative method of disposal for unwanted clothing. They simply throw it in the trash. And that’s become a real problem. According toFast Company, residents of New York City toss 200 million pounds of clothing into the garbage each year. The used clothing goes on to take up space in landfills indefinitely. The Environmental Protection Agency reported in 2015 that 10.5 million tons of textiles wound up in the trash that year. New York’s fashion leaders and the city’s sanitation agencies have started an advertising campaign directing people to over1000 drop-off pointswhere unwanted clothes can be deposited for recycling or repurposing. (Apparel companies are still working on ways to effectively reuse materials that are collected.) But if you can't find one of the collection points in your nabe, what can you do with your old clothes? Selling is one option. Local boutiques may offer only a modest price for your used clothing bundles, but they’ll likely wind up in other hands rather than a landfill. There are also online marketplaces likethredUPandMaterial Worldthat pay cash or offer store credit for designer or chain-store apparel that you mail in. To maximize their value, it’sbestto present clothing folded, buttoned, and cleaned. You can also try sites likeRehash Clothesto facilitate a clothing exchange with others who are looking to spiff up their wardrobe. If you want to toss clothing because it’s damaged, give some thought torepairingit instead. Things like loose or missing buttons can be simple fixes; stains can be obscured by dyeing material.

That includes waste and, more gruesomely, thebodiesof more than 200 mountaineers who perished at some point along the way. Many of the bodies end up staying on the mountain, but waste management is somewhat easier to tackle. According toFodor’s Travel, climbers on the Tibetan side ofMt. Everestare now required to start carrying all of their waste (including the waste their bodies produce naturally). So yes, they’ll have to make room in their backpacks for poop. These measures aren’t exactly extreme, though. Similar requirements are in place at popular climbing spots in the U.S., like Washington state’s Mt. Rainier and Yosemite’s El Capitan, where climbers have to poop in a bag and bring it back with them. In addition, climbers without permits are now indefinitely banned from the Tibetan base camp. The lack of tourists will give a team of 200 people space to clean up the mountainside and remove trash, which has become a growing problem in recent years. These new guidelines were announced by Ci Luo, director of the Chinese Mountaineering Association. BecauseMt. Evereststraddles the border between Nepal and China, each country manages its own side. About 70 percent of all climbers go through to Nepal, but the popularity of the Tibetan side is growing. Mountaineer Adrian Ballinger, who has scaled Mt. Everest eight times, lauded the new changes. “Like many of the world's most beautiful places, Mount Everest is at risk of being loved to death,” he wrote in an opinion piece forABC News. “Too many climbers, too much inexperience, and too many ethically questionable commercial outfitters chasing only profits have led to problems with trash, human waste, and unnecessary accidents, many of which unfairly impact mountain workers like the Sherpa, Tibetans, and other local groups.” As for the Nepalese side, the government requires climbers to pay a $4000 waste deposit, which gets refunded when they return with at least 18 pounds of waste.

If you live in the northern contiguous United States, the meteorological phenomenon may be visible from your backyard on Wednesday, February 27,Thrillistreports. Here's everything you need to know before catching the event. Aurora Borealis, or the Northern Lights, are caused bysolar particlescolliding with gases above Earth. When fast-moving electrons from the Sun hit the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere, they react with oxygen and nitrogen by transferring some of their energy to the gas molecules and ""exciting"" them. The excited molecules eventually return to their normal state and release photons into the air. On a large enough scale, these photons appear as the undulating waves of green, pink, and violet light know as Aurora Borealis. This phenomenon is mostly observed at the poles because that's where the Earth's magnetic field is thestrongest, and therefore where concentrations of solar energy are highest. But occasionally people living at lower latitudes are treated to the spectacle, as should be the case this week. Due to an upcoming geomagnetic storm, experts predict that the Northern Lights will appear farther south than usual on February 27. In the U.S., northern states like Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Maine fall within the aurora's projected range. According to the Space WeatherPrediction Center, geomagnetic activity will peak between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday. That means the best time to see the Northern lights is after the Sun has fully set in your area on the night of February 27.

Researchers also found that the birds had a 20 percent chance of dying after ingesting a single piece of debris. Though hard plastics were consumed in greater quantities by seabirds, balloons proved to be far deadlier. Eating them is “32 times more likely to result in death than ingesting hard plastic,” researchers write in theirpaper, published in the journalScientific Reports. “Marine debris ingestion is now a globally recognized threat,” Lauren Roman, who led the study, said in astatement. “Among the birds we studied, the leading cause of death was blockage of the gastrointestinal tract, followed by infections or other complications caused by gastrointestinal obstructions.” The study also highlighted another startling statistic: 99 percent of all seabird species are predicted to ingest marine debris by 2050. That is of great concern in Australasia, which is home to the world's highest biodiversity of seabirds. Albatross and petrel species are particularly under threat, but the exact role that debris plays in that is not fully known.

However, these particles are smaller than balloon bits, and the consequences of ingesting microplastics are still being studied.

Plus, they can carrydisease risksthat are more threatening to livestock and other domesticated animals, like dogs [PDF]. Pigs may not be trampling over city buildings like Godzilla, but their impact on agricultural land is widespread andsignificant. Denmark has alarger populationof pigs than human beings. Part of this has to do with its lucrativemeat industry, with over 5000 pig farms producing around 28 million pigs, with 20 million being slaughtered each year. In contrast, Denmark's human population is 5 to 6 million people. The pig population is so valuable, in fact, that the countryrecentlybegan building a $12 million wall to prevent wild boars (who could possibly carry African swine fever, a viral disease which is highly contagious and deadly to both wild and domestic pigs, but not humans) in neighboring Germany from invading Danish pig farms. Researchat Penn State in the 1990s demonstrated that pigs, which are often perceived as being dirty and feeble-minded, have a remarkable aptitude for video games. The study showed that pigs are so smart that they were able to learn how to play a game involving a joystick better than chimpanzees and a Jack Russell terrier (a breed often used in movies because it is known for its intelligence and trainability). Wilbur, the main character in E.B. White’s timeless children's taleCharlotte's Web, is likely literature's most beloved pig. The 2006 movie adaptation of the same name seemingly knew as such and used46 pigletsto accurately portray the character on the big screen. Each and every one of the piglets was treated like Hollywood royalty: After filming wrapped, they were looked after and given new homes in Australia (where the film was shot). And, another pig from the movie also got a happy ending—the sow who played Wilbur's mother, who was later namedAlice, went to live at an animal sanctuary with two of the piglets. Squeal! Winston Churchill is best remembered for his leadership as the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War II. It's somewhat of a shame that, lost in his sea of memorable speeches and quotes, his wise view on pigs went a bit unnoticed. ""I am fond of pigs,""Churchilloncesaid. ""Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals."" In other words, dogs seek our approval, cats couldn't care less, but pigs, who are intelligent and sociable, are on more equal-footing with humans. We told you pigs were smart. When they aren't playing barnyardbowling,basketball, or doingpuzzles, sometimes they'll get their thrills from riding a wave. Hawaiian porcinecelebrityKamapua'a—otherwise known asKamathe Surfing Pig—goes boarding with his owner, Kai Holt, often enough that he has his surfing technique down. Kama's even good enough that he can take you out for a ride—via aGoPro, at least—and he's taught his piggieson, Kama 2, the ways of the Shaka life. Sounds like hog heaven. Kermit the Frog may have hisown staron the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but his romantic interest, Miss Piggy, is an icon in her own right. But before the diva was fully realized, she went by a slightly different name. According to handwrittennotesand Polaroids fromMuppetscreator Jim Henson, Miss Piggy was originally named Piggy Lee, a reference to famed jazz singer Peggy Lee. ""When I first created Miss Piggy I called her Miss Piggy Lee—as both a joke and an homage,"" Muppet designer Bonnie Erickson toldSmithsonianin 2008. ""Peggy Lee was a very independent woman, and Piggy certainly is the same."" But, like many a starlet destined for the limelight, Piggy Lee needed her name to be more original. And also, ""as Piggy's fame began to grow, nobody wanted to upset Peggy Lee,"" Erickson added, ""especially because we admired her work."" As a kid, you saved all your spare change in one particular safekeeping storage item: the piggy bank. But of all the animals in the world, why did the pig get all of the glory? In the 13th to 15th centuries, one of the most common places for people to store their money was in jars made of orange-colored clay called ""pygg."" As the English language evolved, that word eventually becamepigorpiggy. Whether by accident or design, around the 19th century manufacturers began molding little pots into the shape of pigs, and eventually piggy banks were all the rage. So next time you bring home a little extra bacon, you know where to put it."
256,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/577289/why-you-shouldnt-crush-aluminum-cans-before-recycling,,"Participating in your local recycling program is a great first step toward reducing waste, but tossing your old containers in the right bin is just one part of the process. To make sure your recyclable goods end up where they're supposed to be, you have to treat them right. That means resisting the urge to crush your aluminum cans, according toLifehacker. Stomping on an empty can may seem like a logical move: A crushed can takes up less space, which should make it easier to store and recycle. But recycling centers actually have a harder time processing cans that have been flattened. Many recycling plants sort recyclable materials by shape. Small items tend to be marked as waste and sent to the landfill (which is why it's better toleave caps onplastic bottles when you recycle them). Flat items are usually sorted with the paper and cardboard, so when a can is crushed, it may be misidentified and end up contaminating a batch of paper items. If you want your aluminum cans to be sent to the right place, leave them in their original 3D shape when you dispose of them. That way your local recycling center will have an easier time identifying the material. But if crushing cans has become a habit, you may be able to keep doing it without creating more waste. Some municipalities use multi-stream recycling systems which are able to recycle your cans properly no matter what shape they're in. So, if you use two separate bins for your recycling and live in a multi-stream recycling area, you can probably continue crushing cans to your heart's content. [h/tLifehacker]"

AsThe Hillreports, voters in Toledo, Ohio passed the Lake Erie Bill of Rights at the end of February in an effort to curb pollution in the great lake. Lake Erie borders four states and Canada, and it provides drinking water to12 million people. It touches several metro areas, including Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland, and Buffalo, which leaves it vulnerable to pollution. In August 2014, residents of Toledo, Ohio were advised to stop drinking tap water for three days after chemical fertilizer runoff triggered toxic algae blooms in the lake. The Lake Erie Bill of Rights aims to prevent similar incidents from happening again by allowing Toledo citizens to sue government or business entities onbehalfof the water source. According to thelegislation, the Lake Erie ecosystem has the legal right ""to exist, flourish and naturally evolve"" without being harmed by human activity. Sixty-one percent of Toledo voters approved the measure in a special election held on February 26. Though Toledo makes up a small part of the Lake Erie basin, its shallow depth and high temperature make it one of the most ecologically diverse parts of the lake and the area most vulnerable to pollution. Environmentalists are hailing the law as a success for the people of Toledo and a big step in the growingrights of naturemovement. Even though the law was approved, there are critics fighting to make sure it never takes effect. Detractors have called the legislation anti-business, saying it will hurt farmers and kill jobs.

259,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/575512/what-happens-to-human-waste-in-antarctica,,"Antarcticais perhaps the most pristine place on Earth, but it takes a great deal of effort to keep it that way. The population of Antarctica—mainlyresearchersand support staff—swells to about5000in the summer months, and the number of tourists that visit during thispeak travel seasonsometimesexceeds40,000. The problem? Where there are humans, there is human waste—and loads of it. Waste removal is a problem affecting other hard-to-reach places, like Mt. Everest in Nepal and China, and Denali in Alaska. China recentlyannouncedthat climbers on the Tibet side of the world's highest peak would have to start carrying away their own poop, while scientists in Alaska warned that global warming could cause an estimated 66 tons offrozen feceson the mountainside to melt. There are international rules in place to make sure Antarctica doesn't acquire a similar problem. The continent is protected under the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty from 1998, which stipulates that ""the amount of waste produced or disposed of in Antarctica should be minimized to protect the environment and other Antarctic values"" [PDF]. However, much of the law is left up to interpretation, with waste treatment procedures varying from one research station to the next. Some of the waste gets treated, then shipped back to various countries, including the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. In other cases, waste is treated anddumpedinto the ocean. The day-to-day logistics of doing your business depend on the location, too. Many of the larger research centers have flush toilets, including the American-runMcMurdoand Amundsen-Scott South Pole stations, but these modern comforts are harder to come by away from base. In lieu of flushable loos, some stations require the two kinds of waste (solids and liquids) to be processedindividually. This can meanseparate toiletsfor separate bodily functions. Out in the field, researchers may need to use poo buckets andpee bottles(women included). And in certain locations, bothChinaand the U.S. use ""rocket toilets"" (officially known as incinolets) that burn the waste, reducing it to ash. Indeed, while everybody poops, not all of it gets treated in the same way. Here's how two different research stations inAntarcticaare handling their waste. McMurdo Station, the largest research station on the continent, is situated south of New Zealand on Antarctica’s Ross Island. It accommodates an average of 850 visitors during the busy summer season, which translates to a whole lot of human waste. For decades, the stationmaceratedits poop (reduced it to smaller particles) and then released the byproduct directly into the ocean. In 1989, a U.S. officialtoldThe New York Times, ""Waste disposal in Antarctica used to be a disgrace. But during the past half-dozen years we've been correcting the sins of earlier generations."" It wasn’t until 2003, though, that McMurdo Station got its very own waste treatment plant connected to its network of flush toilets. The waste gets mashed up by two JWC Environmental Muffin Monster grinders, and those particles then undergo a UV disinfectionprocess. The liquid end-product gets pumped into the ocean. Any solid waste that’s leftover from the treatment process gets packed up and shipped back to America on cargo ships that bring supplies to McMurdo Station on an annual basis. The ships also transport recyclables, food waste, and scientific samples back to the U.S. “The U.S. takes its commitment to the environment seriously, and outside of gray/black wastewater [what flows into the wastewater treatment plant for processing], everything is removed from the continent and taken to the U.S. for final disposal,” Peter West, polar outreach program manager of the National Science Foundation, which runs McMurdo Station, tells Mental Floss. “Even some of the gray/black wastewater from field camps is taken to the U.S. for disposal.” Australia’s researchers used to have a pretty big poo problem. After a waste processing plant at the country’s Davis research stationbroke downin 2005, they had to resort to other means of eliminating the waste left behind by the 120-some scientists and staff who stay there each summer. Instead of the waste being treated, “sewage was burned or else discharged with little or no treatment straight into the sea,” the Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) writes on itswebsite. That disposal method had an unfortunate effect. A 2010 study revealed that the fecal matter wasn’t dispersing well once it was piped into the sea. Instead, it was clumping up in certain areas,exposingnearby seal and penguin populations to high levels of bacteria. These contaminants ultimately wound up in the marine food chain, with “sewage markers""—certain stable isotopes linked to sewage intake—being discovered in a snail and a fish. To address this problem, a new wastewater treatment plant was constructed at Davis station, which is located along the Ingrid Christensen Coast on Princess Elizabeth Land. But before they could start using it, they had to wait for the microbial green light, so to speak. “Wastewater treatment plants rely on microbes to eat much of the waste in the wastewater, and it takes a while for these to multiply sufficiently to do this job when starting a new plant,” Michael Packer, Australian Antarctic Division engineer, tells Mental Floss. “Anywhere else in the world, this process can be kickstarted by introducing doses of these microbes. In Antarctica it is a bit more tricky as we don’t want to introduce foreign species to the environment down there.” Once the naturally occurring microbes started reporting for duty, the plant became operational in 2016. It soon begantransformingwaste “into some of the cleanest water in the world,” according to the AAD. When a more advanced stage of treatment goes into effect later this year, the quality of the treated wastewater will improve once again. “It will be even cleaner than the water that comes out of the tap in the average Australian house,” Packer says. From there, the water is discharged into the ocean. Any leftover solid waste is then concentrated in a decanter and shipped back to Australia. And yes, in case you were wondering, all three of Australia’s research stations have flush toilets. Any researcher who has to answer the call of nature while away from Davis station must carry their waste with them so that it can be treated back at base. Suffice it to say, if you're planning to visit one of the most remote regions of the world, don't forget your bottle."
260,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/581049/when-the-government-planned-to-nuke-alaska,,"In the 1950s, the idea of harnessing nuclear power was a bit of a public relations disaster. The world at large knew nuclear bombs only as tools of mass death and destruction. But if the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)—later the Department of Energy—had its way, nuclear explosions would have been reinvented as peacetime assets to humanity. As proof of concept, the AEC planned to nuke Alaska. Atlas Obscuradetails the plot, which reads almost as farce. In the late 1950s, the AEC was developing Project Plowshare, a plan to repurpose thermonuclear weapons to change the literal face of the Earth. Imagine blasting through mountains to create railways or widening the Panama Canal. The instantaneous landscape shifts caused by such weapons were economically attractive—saving on labor costs—and might also provide access to natural resources like oil. The excavation and fracking potential seemed limitless. In 1958, the AEC and physicist Edward Teller proposed the first step in this bold new direction: Project Chariot. Theplanwas to detonate a 1-megaton H-bomb near Cape Thompson in Alaska along with several other, smaller explosions to create a crater 1000 feet in diameter and 110 feet deep. The resulting deepwater harbor would facilitate mineral mining and fishing access. The U.S. government rhapsodized about the idea in the media, claiming the then-contemporary weapons had low fallout and would create a port that would be nothing but a net gain for Alaskans. Residents, however, met these plans with a degree of skepticism. The Inuit population who lived nearby and would have to cope with the radioactive consequences of such a scheme voiced their opposition to the idea. They pointed to earlier test blasts that showed radioactivity showering the vicinity. In 1954, a blast in the Bikini Atoll had a nuclear fallout of 7000 square miles in the Pacific Ocean. Owing to such tests, the Inuit were already demonstrating heightened radioactivity levels. So were the caribou they ingested. The notion of a “clean” nuclear bomb was something no one wanted to test with their own life. Project Chariot never materialized, and the idea of wielding nuclear power to replace manual labor was laid to rest by 1977. [h/tAtlas Obscura]"

Their findings were recently published in the journalFood Hydrocolloids. Any protein that comes from “stem or stem-like animal cells” that are cultured in a lab can be considered lab-grown meat, according toPenn State. While lab-grown meat can be labeled a meat substitute because it requires far fewer animals for its production, it remains to be seen whethervegansand vegetarians will be willing to eat it. Lab-grown meat is still very much in the development stages, and scientists are working on ways to improve the texture. Because cultured muscle cells don’t have any particular structure when they grow, the meat generally comes out resembling ground beef. That’s fine if you’re hoping to make more humane tacos, but it presents a challenge when trying to create, say, a lab-grown steak. This is where the toy bricks came in. Researchers used LEGOPower Functionsto create an electrospinning device that was capable of turning starch fibers into a structured meat “scaffold.” The plastic pieces were ideal because they weren’t conductive, which was crucial because the researchers were working with water and ethanol.

Americans spend roughly $5.7 billion annually on paper towels, using them to clean up everything from spilled coffee to baby dribble to windows. Roll after roll is unspooled from a paper towel holder, makes a detour into a mess, then winds up directly in the garbage. Are we really so lazy that we can’t wring out and reuse a sponge, a cloth wipe, or washable napkins? Or has Big Towel brainwashed us into believing that paper towels are simply the most convenient method of keeping things clean? The question was recently explored byThe Atlantic's Joe Pinsker, who noticed that Americans make up nearly half of the world’s paper towel use. (Second-place France spends just $635 million per year on discarded towels, little more than a tenth of what the U.S. shells out.) Pinsker wondered if it was due in part to population, but even on a per capita basis, we still spend more on towels than any other country in the world. Countries with comparable economies don’t buy as much as we do. It turns out that the reasoning behind our alleged paper towel obsession may reside in how we problem-solve. In using a disposable towel, a mess can be immediately addressed and discarded, leaving no trace or obligation to clean our cleaning supplies. There may also be pragmatic reasons: Using one-time-use towels reduces the chances of cross-contamination. (Imagine a sponge covering a bacteria-covered surface, then being set aside for reuse later.) And in a public bathroom setting, paper towels may actually bemore hygienicthan hand dryers, which can spread bacteria. If you have a paper towel addiction, one tip Pinsker passed along is to consider reusing them. (Provided, of course, the mess wasn’t made up of raw meat or fish.) Sturdier paper towels can sometimes stand up to multiple applications before they start to break apart.

The Associated Pressreportsthat the federal government shutdown has forced rangers and other staff to stay on the sidelines while many national parks remain open to the public.

One Yosemite Valley resident told the AP that the sight of overflowing trash receptacles and illegal behavior is “heartbreaking.” ALos Angeles Timesstorynoted that visitors are urinating and defecating on the sides of roads because the park has closed the restrooms.

A newstudyin theJournal of the American Heart Associationsuggests that living in green areas is correlated with certain biomarkers for cardiovascular health. Scientists analyzed blood and urine samples from 408 people at a cardiology clinic, then compared the results tosatellite-deriveddata on the levels of greenery around those patients’ homes (using 820-foot and half-mile radiuses). Adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status, “neighborhood deprivation” and other factors known to be linked heart disease rates, the researchers found that living in a green area was correlated with several markers of a healthy heart. Blood and urine samples from those participants who lived in green neighborhoods showed lower levels of sympathetic activation—the body’s automatic fight-or-flight response, which raises the heart rate and is involved in heart failure. Those participants also had reduced oxidative stress—an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, which can cause tissue damage and is linked to chronic disease. And they had higher angiogenic capacity, which refers to the body’s ability to form new blood vessels. All this suggests that being around trees is somehow linked to having a healthier heart, though these are just biomarkers, not rates of heart disease or major cardiac events. But while scientists have yet to prove directly that being around trees causes your heart to be healthier, it’s not the first study to suggest a link.In 2015, a study of American women found that rates of heart disease went up in certain areas after a beetle invasion killed off a significant number of trees.

An organization calledBrick Recyclerlets you donate your pre-loved LEGOs by mailing them directly to their facility in San Jose, California. Brick Recycler then matches those donations with recipients, which may include hospital patients, children in foster care, or kids living in low-income areas. To sweeten the deal, the organization says you don't have to worry about sorting or cleaning the pieces. Brick Recycler accepts mismatched sets or those with missing pieces, and they also handle the sanitation themselves. Other sites likeThe Giving Brick(based in Kansas City, Kansas) andBrickDreams(based in Folsom, California) also accept donations of LEGO bricks in all conditions.

Home to about 22,000 people, the Orkney Islands are a stunning landscape known for having charming villages, ancient Neolithic structures, sheer cliffs, and churning seas. A collection of about 70 islands roughly 10 miles from the mainland, Orkney straddles the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean and, as a result, is home to incrediblystrong tides, making it a prime place to harness energy from the sea. This shouldn’t be surprising—the Orkney Islands have been at the forefront of renewable energy for years. The world’s first grid-connected wind turbine was tested in Orkney in 1951. For more than 15 years, the islands were home to the world’s largest wind turbine. In 2014, the islands produced 104 percent of their needed power through renewable energy sources. And today, they are home to the European Marine Energy Centre, orEMEC, a facility that tests the viability of tide-based energy technologies. Since its inception more than a decade ago, EMEC has helped install at least 30 different prototypes in Orkney’s waters, from a submergedArchimedes Screwto an underwater kite.According tothe Orkney Renewable Energy Forum, there are “more grid-connected ocean energy devices tested in Orkney than at any other single site in the world.” Most recently, a new prototype has been making a huge splash.

As the network explains, the single device “can typically generate 7 percent of Orkney’s electricity, but at points has been able to power more than a quarter of the area’s homes.” And it can do more than create energy from the motion of the ocean—it’s capable of helping produce hydrogen fuel, too. Earlier this year, electricity created by the SR2000 was fed into anelectrolyzerand used to split water molecules into their component parts of oxygen and hydrogen. Plans are to use this hydrogen in fuel cells, which can become a supplemental power source for ferries docking in Orkney. While all of the Orkney generators feed their electricity into the UK’s grid, there are hopes to introduce the technology to other parts of Great Britain's waters—the UK governmentestimatesthat wave and tidal energy have the potential to supply 20 percent of the country’s electricity needs."

As temperatures in Maine have plunged, a giant, floating ice disk has formed on the river's surface,NBC Newsreports—and it's gaining worldwide attention. The ice disk appeared when a cold snap hit the Portland, Maine suburb earlier in January. It isn't unusual to see ice chunks floating down the Presumpscot River this time of year, but this floe is notable for its size (roughly 300 feet across!) and shape. From land, it looks like a near-perfect circle, prompting comparisons to flying saucers and the moon. And as of Wednesday, January 16, the disk had been slowly spinning counter-clockwise. The uncanny sight is actually the result of a natural process. According to experts, the disk likely formed when a chunk of river ice got caught in a vortex powered by awaterfall100 feet upstream. As the ice spun it would have bumped into the shore continuously, smoothing out its rough edges into a smooth circle. CBS 13reports that the giant ice pancake stopped spinning on Wednesday after getting caught on another piece of ice near the the riverbank. It continuous to attract spectators and serve as a landing pad for local ducks. [h/tNBC News]"

The law applies not only to takeout containers, but also to foam coffee cups, bowls, and plates as well as packing peanuts. City officials initially approved the so-called ""Foam Ban"" in 2013, citing environmental concerns. However, asThe New York Timespoints out, the containers are often incorrectly labeled as Styrofoam—a trademarked product made by Dow Chemical that isn’t used in disposable food containers. More specifically, the containers are made of a type of plastic foam that’s not biodegradable and also notoriously hard to recycle. New York City's ban went into effect in July 2015, but a judgeoverturned itthree months later, after the restaurant industry banded together and sued the city. The restaurant coalition argued the city could recycle the material and even save money by doing so. Of course, there were other motivating factors: Alternatives to plastic foam food containers are more expensive. The legal battle continued into 2017, when another judged ruled in favor of the city and said the ban could be reenacted. However, the government is making special exceptions for nonprofit organizations and small business owners who can demonstrate that the ban would significantly hurt their operations. Also exempted are butcher shops, which use the foam containers for raw meat. Meanwhile, a similar foam ban justtook effectin the city of Rockville, Maryland. Dozens ofother citieshave banned the material, including Washington, DC, Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

But what about cacti, ferns, and other common plants? Was our garden salad once capable of letting one rip? If youdefinefartas the Merriam-Webster dictionary does—to expel intestinal gas from the anus—then no, plants don’t fart, because they don’t have anuses. However, they do expel gas (including methane, a greenhouse gas found in human and animal farts), so they basically fart in their own plantlike way. According toPopular Science, microbes in trees produce gas in much the same way that microbes in the human body break down food and create gas. Methane then seeps out of a tree’s bark or stems. Biogeochemist Patrick Megonigal, an associate director of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, says it isn’t known if these “farts” provide some sort of benefit to the trees. However, researchers have found “that some trees fart more than others,” Megonigal toldPopSci. The fact that some leafy, above-ground plants release methane was onlydiscoveredin 2006. It was previously known that swamp plants release methane, which bubbles up to the surface in mud or water, but scientists didn’t realize the same rule applies to other plants and trees as well. Some plants’ farts aremore obviousthan others. According to a 2016 study published inPlant Physiology, “shy plants” (officially known asMimosa pudicaplants) are less shy when it comes to their flatulence. In fact, they have been known to release a smelly stench when they’re poked or prodded. Researchers believe that gas rich in sulfur compounds is released from tiny hairlike sacs that run along the plant’s root. Six otherMimosaspecies are also capable of farting, and researchers say this could be a defense mechanism used to ward off other plants that encroach on their personal space. So unless you want to wade through a cloud of sulfur-infused farts, steer clear. [h/tPopular Science]"

The study finds that even if the world puts moderate restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, roughly 10,000 homes built after 2009 will be at risk of at least yearly flooding by 2050. The numbers are about three times higher by 2100 and five times higher if carbon emissions aren't reined in at all. The data is even more sobering when houses built prior to this decade are taken into account. If pollution goes unchecked for the next 80 years, 2.5 million built before today, amounting to $1.33 trillion, will be at risk of at least one flood per year.

AsNational Geographicreports, more tuskless elephants have emerged in regions where their ivory has made them a target. Elephant poaching has long been in a problem Africa, but the crisis reached a fever pitch during Mozambique's 15-year civil war. Between1977 and 1992, 90 percent of the elephants living in the country's Gorongosa National Park were slaughtered for ivory used to fund the conflict. The diminished numbers aren't the only thing that looks different about Gorongosa's elephants today. Poachers often kill male elephants first because they have bigger tusks, and once they're eliminated, the hunters will go after females. Typically, about 2 to 4 percent of all female African elephants never develop tusks—but among female elephants that survived Mozambique's civil war, that number is 51 percent. The effects of poaching can also be observed in the next generation. Roughly 32 percent of female elephants born after 1992 are tuskless. The trend can be seen in other parts of Africa where poaching has ravaged elephant populations. In Ruaha National Park in Tanzania, elephant behavior researcher Josephine Smit has observed that over one fifth of female elephants older than 5 years lack tusks. Tusklessness rates reach about 35 percent in females over 25. The statistics are even harder to ignore in South Africa's Addo Elephant National Park, where tuskless animals made up 98 percent of all female elephants in the early 2000s.South Luangwa National Parkin Zambia, Lupande Game Management Area in Zambia, and Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda each reported higher-than-average rates of tusklessness immediately following the ivory wars of the 1970s and '80s. Though poaching is on the decline thanks tobans on the ivory tradeand other conservation efforts in Africa, its impact can still be felt. In East Africa, the elephant population was nearlyhalvedbetween 2008 and 2018. The establishment of wildlife preserves, DNA tracing, andGPS trackingare just a few of the ways conservationists are working to crack down on poachers and restore the species.

Even with thousands of volunteers working on the ground, tallying all the trees in a city like New York can take years, according toCity Lab, and such surveys often don't account for the trees growing in parks or on private property. Using artificial intelligence, researchers at the geospatial analytics startupDescartes Labshave found a way to map all the trees in major cities without taking to the streets. To make the New York tree map below, Descartesprogrammeda machine learning model to identify tree canopies from satellite images. This isn't as easy as pinpointing green spots: The program had to be taught to distinguish trees from other greenery, like grass and shrubs, using artificial intelligence. This sets it apart from other tools used to map vegetation like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which only accounts for light wavelengths, not height. When applied to New York, the tree-mapping technology provides a different view of the city. Some of the most heavily trafficked areas, like downtown Brooklyn and Times Square, are blank spaces on the map. Not surprisingly, parks like Forest Park in Queens and Central Park in Manhattan have the densest concentrations of trees, but some affluent neighborhoods, like the West Village and the Upper East Side, also have plenty of greenery.

Much like the recently releasedMyro deodorant,byHumankind's B.O.-fighting, eco-friendly formula comes in a reusable tube. While the outer tube is plastic, it's designed to last you forever. Instead of throwing it out and buying a new tube every month, the company sends you a refill of the aluminum-free natural deodorant formula in a cardboard pod that fits neatly inside the hard plastic casing. The company also donates $1 for every reusable container it sells to removing plastic from theocean. Deodorant isn't the only waste-producing bathroom product thatbyHumankind is looking to innovate, though. The company has also released mouthwash tablets—which look like fancy mints—that you can dissolve in a cup of water or chew directly. The effervescent tablets (in mint, spearmint, orange, lemon, and grapefruit flavors) are designed to normalize the pH of your mouth without the burn of alcohol. Your first shipment of the tablets comes in a reusable plastic container, with subsequent refills arriving in eco-friendly paper packaging. The new product launch also includes a shampoo bar that further eliminates the need for plastic bottles in your bathroom. You use it just like a bar of soap, lathering it in your hand or against your head. It's available in lemongrass, thyme, or lemon lavender scents, and is designed to reduce dryness so that you don’t need conditioner at all. The refill containers themselves are either made of entirely paper or mostly paper, and all reduce the single-use plastic normally associated with the product by at least 90 percent. (The deodorant refill tube, for instance, has a little plastic cap on it, although most of the tube is cardboard.) All of the packaging materials, meanwhile, are made of compostable fibers like bamboo. They're not only recyclable, but they can be disposed of right in your backyard. According to the company, you can bury the packaging in the ground and it will degrade within 90 days. All the new products are sold on a subscription basis.

For this project, ""most endangered"" refers to the animals that face the greatest risk of extinction. An art director and designer then teamed up to create gorgeous illustrations of each animal. Since some regions are home to many of the same creatures, a different animal was selected from the shortlist of endangered species in cases where there were duplicates from one state to the next.

The name change (from National Lakeshore to National Park) was included in a 465-page joint resolution that President Donald Trump approved last week. Throughout history, many of America’s national parks have been created by presidential decree. Theodore Roosevelt famouslycreatedfive national parks—including Crater Lake and Mesa Verde—and Woodrow Wilson oversaw the establishment of the National Park Service, the Grand Canyon, and Rocky Mountain National Park.

Situated along the southern tip of Lake Michigan, just a short distance from Chicago, the park is a popular place to swim and surf in the summer or hike and snowshoe in the winter. As the name suggests, the area is best known for its sand dunes, but it’s also home to 15,000 acres of wetlands, woodlands, prairies, black oak savannas, and bogs.

They can be immense: One London fatberggrewto be 143 tons, becoming acautionary talefor the rest of the world. These mobile chunks of waste travel in sewers, creating significant blockages. The fatbergs can force untreated water into clean water sources and cause backups in residential plumbing. With New York City currently spending $20 million annually on clearing these blockages, officials have decided to mount a public campaign cautioning residents against some of their bad plumbing habits. They have a newwebsiteadmonishing people to abide by the “Four Ps” of flushing—poop, pee, puke and (toilet) paper are fine, while grease and wet wipes are not. Those should be thrown in the garbage. While most people don’t have a problem directing their vomit and feces into a toilet without written instruction, there’s still a widely held belief that wet wipes are safe to flush. This is likely due to companies labeling them “flushable” on packaging, though the city’s anti-fatberg site insists that “flushable” simply means they won’t clog a toilet. Once it’s in the sewer system and mingles with grease, the wipes begin to contribute to a public health problem. The city removed almost 53,000 tons of debris from sewage treatment screens in 2017.

But how well do you really know the Colorado River’s most famous handiwork? Here are 11 facts about the Grand Canyon, which Congress declared a U.S. National Park on February 26, 1919. Let’s clear up this misconception right off the bat. The Arizona landmark may well be the world’s grandest canyon, but it’s not the deepest. Agreeing on how to measure the depth of gorges is a surprisingly difficult task, but depending on who you ask, that distinction goes to Peru’s Cotahuasi Canyon, which is over 11,000 feet deep, or Nepal’sKali Gandaki Gorge. The Grand Canyon, on the other hand, is just one mile deep. The Grand Canyon can’t claim the domestic championship:Hells Canyonhas been carved by the Snake River along the border of Oregon and Idaho and drops a half a mile deeper than the Grand Canyon. Like measuring depth, figuring out a canyon’s age is not as easy as you might think. Until recently, estimatespeggedthe Grand Canyon’s age at 6 million years. It turns out that the answer may not be that straightforward, though. In the last decade, controversy haseruptedin scientific circles over just how many candles should be on the geologic marvel’s birthday cake. Attempts to analyze the minerals within the canyon led to the conclusion that the canyon may be more like 70 million years old. What makes answering what seems like a simple question so difficult? The Grand Canyon may not have been carved in one fell swoop by the Colorado River. Instead, one hypothesis posits that the canyon may have formed in pieces over time, withparts of itdating back as many as 70 million years, but with the connected canyon we know and love today only emerging in the last 6 million years. Referred to asÖngtupqain the Hopi language, the Grand Canyon carries great spiritual significance for the Native American tribe that has long inhabited the region. Upon death, a Hopi is believed to pass westward through thesipapuni, or “place of emergence”—a dome of mineral deposits that sits upstream from the union of the Colorado River and the Little Colorado River inside the canyon—on his or her journey into the afterlife. A trek from the peak of the Grand Canyon’s North Rim, which stands about 8000 feet above sea level, to its bottom a mile down may see a traveler experience temperatureswingsof more than 25ºF. Summer highs in the depths of the gorge can exceed 100ºF, and winter lows at the crest can dip to 0ºF. After thousands of years of inhabitation by Native American groups, the Grand Canyon welcomed its first European visitor in the 16th century. Aided by Hopi locals, Spanish conquistador García López de Cárdenas led an exploration of the grounds in 1540, evensending three soldiersdown to explore the canyon’s depths. The trek didn’t last very long: The soldiers were overcome by thirst, possibly because the Hopi intentionally safeguarded their valued Colorado River from the travelers’ reach. After this initial contact didn’t reveal any great riches in the area, there was little urgency to return on the part of the Spanish. Europeans didn’t make their second visit until 1776, when Spanish priestsFrancisco Atanasio Domínguezand Silvestre Vélez de Escalante happened upon the canyon while attempting to find a route from Santa Fe to their Catholic mission in Monterey, California. In the very same year, another Spanish missionary,Francisco Garcés, took in the canyon during a largely unsuccessful attempt to convert the local Havasupai to Christianity. In 1869, seven years after losing his right arm during the Battle of Shiloh in the American Civil War,John Wesley Powellled nine men—including a printer for theRocky Mountain News, an 18-year-old mule driver and bullwhacker, and Powell’s own brother—on a thousand-milemissiondown the Colorado River and its tributaries and through the Grand Canyon. Only six members of the team would complete the expedition, butPowellreturned in 1871 with congressional backing and an 11-man team that included scientists. That trip produced the first maps of the Colorado River. Roosevelt needed just one visit to the Grand Canyon in 1903 before he decided that the marvel should be protected. Unfortunately, it was beyond his authority to designate an area as a national park without congressional approval. To sidestep what he predicted would be an uncooperative Congress, Roosevelt took the long way around. In 1893, President Benjamin Harrison had established a forest preserve in the area, and so Roosevelt was able to add considerably more protection in 1906 by using a presidential proclamation to designate the area as the Grand Canyon Game Preserve. Two years later, he declared the area a national monument. The area was safe, but even then, Roosevelt couldn’t get thegreen lightto create the Grand Canyon National Park—formal approval didn’t come until 1919. Brothers Emery and Ellsworth Kolb devoted their lives tophotographingnatural beauty, and in setting up a studio on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon in 1906, they found a savvybusiness opportunityas well. From their studio at the head of the Bright Angel Trail, the brothers would snap photographs of tourists as they departed for the canyon’s bottom on mules. When the tourists made their way back up to the rim that evening, the brothers would be ready to sell themdeveloped printsdocumenting their journey. On April 5, 1909, theArizona Gazettedetailedthe findings of two archaeologists who claimed to have discovered traces of either an ancient Tibetan or Ancient Egyptian civilization in an underground tunnel network within the Grand Canyon. The story of ancient artifacts like copper and gold urns and mummified bodies discovered by two affiliates of the Smithsonian causedquite a stir, but it unraveled quickly. The Smithsonian denied any knowledge of the pair of scientists, and subsequent searches failed to uncover the “nearly inaccessible” cavern the (possibly fictitious) duo claimed to have found. Despite this lack of evidence, the belief that the Smithsonian actually found and covered up this cave of wonder remainspersistentamong conspiracy theorists."

The artifact was spotted byThe Kid Should See This. The igloo (origluinInuktitut) in this footage takes around 90 minutes to erect, but a similar structure can be built by a skilled person in as little as 40 minutes. To put together the shelter, the two men carve up firm, packed snow into blocks that are about 2 feet tall, 3 feet wide, and 4 inches thick. After the first row of blocks is placed in a circle on the ground, the builder slices a section of the blocks to create a slope. Each row that's placed on this foundation will spiral upward, creating a shape in which the blocks support their own weight. By the time the keystone block is fitted into the top, the igloo is strong enough to support the weight of a man. The final steps are carving a doorway out of the bottom of the structure and plugging up the cracks with additional snow from outside. Even on a frigid Arctic night, the temperature of a well-insulated igloo can reach 40 degrees above the temperature outside. And the warmer the igloo gets over time,the strongerit becomes: The heat from the Sun and the bodies of the inhabitants melt the outer layers of the blocks, and that water eventually freezes to ice, giving the home more insulation and structural integrity.

But be honest with yourself: If there’s anybody on your list who is probably going to toss your thoughtful note into the trash five minutes later, just send them a digital greeting. Few things are more annoying than watching the whole strand of Christmas lights go dark just because of one cruddy bulb.According tothe EPA, strands that are wired in parallel will still work if a bulb bursts, “so you won’t be throwing away ‘bad’ strands.” And if you’re the type of person who worries constantly about whether you turned the lights off, put your displays on a timer: It saves energy, money, and worry. We don’t want to sound like Scrooges here. A gift exchange with your colleagues or acquaintances can be a delightful way to get to know people better. But let’s be real: If you don’t already know the people well, chances are you’ll give—and receive—something that will be thrown away within days. It’s OK to just say no. Here’s a tip: If you need a second or third opinion on a gift—""Do you think so-and-so would like this?""—don’t buy it. We all love planning a thoughtful surprise, but few things are as wasteful as buying somebody something they don’t want or need. Be forward and ask people what they’d like. And give helpful suggestions when people are shopping for you. Tickets to a concert or game, dance lessons, a reservation at a hotel, and other experiential gifts don’t require wrapping or packing peanuts. Besides, many people insist that they find experiences more meaningful than physical objects (and there are even somescientific studiesthat back that observation up). Hide them instead! If you have small children, one of the most fun (or evil) things you can do is create a scavenger hunt. (This also works on adults who have refused to grow up.) Searching for gifts in mundane-yet-unexpected places like a pillowcase, a cookie tin, or in the pocket of a coat buried deep in the attic closet can be more surprising and fun than unwrapping them. Every year, millions of pounds of wrapping paper end up in the trash. “Some wrapping paper is recyclable—but it has to be not metallic, textured, or have glitter or ribbon on it,” Tim Donnelly writes in agreat guideat Lifehacker. If you do buy recyclable paper, make sure to use it correctly and remove all the tape before recycling it. In fact, why not just skip the tape entirely and bundle the present the old-fashioned way with some string or ribbons (which you’re reusing, right)? If you’re the creative type, gifts wrapped in old catalogs, newspapers, butcher paper, magazines, and other paper products lying around the house can actually look quite handsome.According toone oft-cited statistic, “If every family in the U.S. reused just 2 feet of holiday ribbon, the 38,000 miles of ribbon saved could tie a bow around the entire planet."" We know. This one is nearly impossible—but resist the urge to pop anybubble wrapyou receive. Save whatever packaging you get to be used later. (That includes those pesky packing peanuts!)"

For the study, UK-based researchers from the University of Exeter, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, and Greenpeace Research Laboratories studied turtles that had died after being stranded or accidentally caught by commercial fishing operations. All seven marine turtlespecieswere tested, including theendangeredgreen turtle and the critically endangered hawksbill and Kemp's ridley turtles. The specimens were found off the coasts of North Carolina in the Atlantic Ocean, northern Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea, and Queensland, Australia in the Pacific Ocean. Necropsies revealed plastic particles under 5mm in length, while microplastic fibers were one of the most common contaminants detected in their guts. These can come from a variety of sources, including clothing, tires, cigarette filters, ropes, and fishing nets. More than 800 synthetic particles were found in the turtles. Only one section of the gut was tested in each animal, so the actual number is likely 20 times higher, according to a University of Exeter statement. A2015 study, also inGlobal Change Biology, estimated that 52 percent of all sea turtles may have ingested microplastics. ""From our work over the years, we have found microplastic in nearly all the species of marine animals we have looked at, from tiny zooplankton at the base of the marine food web to fish larvae, dolphins, and now turtles,"" Dr. Penelope Lindeque, of the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, said in the statement. ""This study provides more evidence that we all need to help reduce the amount of plastic waste released to our seas and maintain clean, healthy, and productive oceans for future generations."" The consequences of ingesting microplastics—via contaminated water or by eating other fish or plants—isn't currently known. The particles are small enough to pass through the gut without causing any blockages, unlike larger plastics which can—and do—wreak havoc on marine life. While the authors concluded that microplastics, at their current levels, post less of a threat than fisheries bycatch and entanglements in fishing gear, they said further studies should be conducted to determine the actual risks. ""They may possibly carry contaminants, bacteria, or viruses, or they may affect the turtle at a cellular or subcellular level,"" lead author Dr. Emily Duncan of the University of Exeter said.

Anew studypublished in the journalFood Webspaints a very different picture of the Chernobyl exclusion zone. By placing motion-activated cameras on site, researchers from the University of Georgia had the chance to see white-tailed eagles, wolves, raccoon dogs, mink, and the elusive Eurasian otter. They confined their research to the Polesie State Radiation Ecological Reserve (PSRER), a 2600-square-kilometer area surrounding the Pripyat River in present-day Belarus. The area is highly restricted, and the lack of people in the area helped contribute to the boom in wildlife, researchers wrote in their paper. Earlier research from 2015 revealed that wolves and other animals were abundant in the region. In this latest study, researchers placed fish carcasses along the banks of rivers and canals to see what types of scavengers would take the bait. Fifteen different vertebrate species, including a variety of mammals and birds, were spotted over the course of the month-long study. Some of the animals had never been spotted there before. “We’ve seen evidence of a diversity of wildlife in the CEZ through our previous research, but this is the first time that we’ve seen white-tailed eagles, American mink, and river otter on our cameras,” James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, said in astatementreleased by the University of Georgia. This study helps researchers better understand the ecology of scavengers in the area, which is still contaminated withradioactive isotopes.

Between October 1 and the beginning of February, Downtown Los Angeles saw12.91 inchesof rain, which is approximately 167 percent more than the seasonal average. All that precipitation will produce an explosion of color when spring arrives in Anza-Borrego desert three hours southeast of Los Angeles. Experts predict the 2019 super bloom could start as early as late February and last through March. If the last super bloom is any indication, this year's event will attract crowds of sight-seers.

The main two types we rely on for our caffeine fix—arabica and robustabeans—are both threatened by climate change and deforestation. The team of UK-based researchers used Red List of Threatened Species criteria from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to classify the risks facing the world’s 124 known species of wild coffee. About 60 percent of them—or 75 different species—face possible extinction in the coming decades. This represents “one of the highest levels recorded for a plant group,” researchers write in their paper. Partly to blame are the severe droughts associated with climate change, as well as deforestation. Other threats include the spread of fungal pathogens and coffee wilt disease in Central and South America and Africa, respectively, as well as social and economic factors for growers. “Considering threats from human encroachment and deforestation, some [coffee species] could be extinct in 10 to 20 years, particularly with the added influence of climate change,"" lead author Aaron P. Davis, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, tellsCNN. Davis’s previous research stressed that arabica, which is already listed as an endangered species, could be extinct within 60 years. Most of the coffee plants werely onare farmed, but wild coffee is no less important. Some wild species are resistant to disease and have other useful genes that could be introduced to commercial crops. That way, the cultivated varieties might endure the effects of climate change better and stick around a little longer. Consumersaren’t the only ones concerned, either. Coffee farming is an industry that supports about 100 million workers around the world.

For years, climate scientists have suggested eating less meat to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, but the researchers behind a new study say dietary changes are essential to prevent global catastrophe. Thestudy—published in the journalNature—is the most comprehensive analysis of how the global food system affects the environment,The Guardianreports. In addition to greenhouse gases being released by livestock, deforestation and water shortages are a couple of other ways that current food production methods hurt the planet. Researchers say there is no easy fix to slow climate change, but reducing our intake of meat is one way that everyone can help out. “There is no magic bullet,” Marco Springmann, who led the study, tellsThe Guardian. “But dietary and technological change [on farms] are the two essential things, and hopefully they can be complemented by reduction in food loss and waste."" That doesn’t mean you have to become a vegetarian or vegan, though. Researchers recommend a “flexitarian” diet, which involves occasionally eating meat. For this to make a positive impact, the average global citizen would have to eat 90 percent less pork, 75 percent less beef, and half the number of eggs they normally consume. If you simply can't give up steak, the Climate, Land, Ambition & Rights Alliance (CLARA)recommendsconsuming just two 5-ounce servings of meat per week. Researchers in theNaturestudy say beans, nuts, and seeds are all recommended sources of protein. By their estimates, a global shift towards a flexitarian diet would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 56 percent, and would reduce other environmental impacts by 6 to 22 percent. They say the global food system emitted around 5.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, in addition to using vast amounts of cropland, fresh water, and fertilizers containing nitrogen and phosphorus (which pollute waterways as agricultural runoff). “If socioeconomic changes towards Western consumption patterns continue, the environmental pressures of the food system are likely to intensify, and humanity might soon approach the planetary boundaries for global freshwater use, change in land use, and ocean acidification,” researchers write in their paper. In other words, the current food system might not be able to sustain the projected population of10 billionpeople in 2060. The study follows the recent release of aUN reportin which scientists warned that we have only 12 years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Failing to do so would result in more extreme weather events, including drought, floods, and severe heat.

At the same time, two other fires—Woolsey and Hill—have been wreaking damage in areas northwest of Los Angeles. Here are some ways you can help the victims. Making a financial contribution to a nonprofit that’s helping wildfire victims is usually the best way of ensuring your donation will be utilized, according to the Center for International Disaster Information. The flexibility of a monetary donation lets disaster responders decide what’s most needed at any given moment.

American Red Cross California Community Foundation’s Wildlife Relief Fund California Fire Foundation Enloe Medical Center Google(Scroll down and click ""Yes, Donate"") Humane Society of Ventura County North Valley Community Foundation Salvation Army United Way of Greater Los Angeles Before determining which charity to choose, it pays to visitCharity Navigatorand do a little bit of research to determine which organizations are the most reputable, and how much of your donation will make it directly to the victims. If you’re based in California and want to contribute something other than money, you have a few options. But first, make sure you’re choosing an organization that has the time and resources to coordinate these donations.Los Angeles firefighters, for example, received way more goods (to the tune of 5000 pounds) than they could handle. However, you can still donate non-perishable food items to theSalvation Army Ventura Corps, which is assisting individuals affected by the Woolsey and Hill fires in Southern California. If you happen to see days-old requests for donated goods, just visit that organization's website or social media channels first to make sure they aren't at full capacity. Airbnb is encouraging people in the Butte County region to open up their homes to wildfire victims while the figure out longer-term arrangements. From now through November 29, Airbnb users can advertise their homes as free, temporary shelters for aid workers and evacuees,The New York Timesreports. Hosts have the chance to communicate with potential guests in advance, and hosts can also determine the length of stay. Hosts in Butte County are welcome to sign up (clickherefor more info), as well as those living in Ventura, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, and San Diego counties (clickherefor info). Just as humans are being displaced by California's wildfires, so too are their pets.

Energy Starestimatesthat an efficient dishwasher can save you $40 a year in electricity costs. Newer designs ensure that even with less water, you’re still getting your dishes as clean as possible. Dishwashers heat water up to levels you wouldn't be able to handle while manually washing dishes—Energy Star certification dictates that a dishwasher has to heat up to 140°F—meaning that it can disinfect those gross plates better than you could yourself. Internal sensors can detect the amount of grime in the water, according toNPR, so that the dishwasher only uses as much water as it needs, and manufacturers have tweaked the design ofdish racksto make sure each dish and utensil gets as much contact with the water as possible during that brief period. That’s why experts NPR spoke to recommended scraping your plates clean before putting them in the dishwasher, rather than giving them a pre-rinse. If you must scrub by hand, it’s better to fill up a large metal pot to wash in rather than filling a whole sink. But why waste your time?

And climate change will likely only make the problemworsein the coming years. New technology, however, promises to cheaply create potablewaterfrom just air,Fast Companyreports.

The group's techniquerecently wonthe $1.50 million Water Abundance XPRIZE, a two-year competition devoted to coming up with energy-efficient ways to harvest fresh water from the air. The competition required teams to create a device that could extract at least 2000 liters (528 gallons) a day from the atmosphere using renewable energy, at a cost of no more than 2 cents per liter. That would be enough to provide for about 100 people for $40 a day or less. In response to the challenge, the Skysource/Skywater Alliance team created WEDEW, or ""wood-to-energy deployed water."" The system uses technology Skywater had already developed to pull water from the air. The Skywater machine essentially creates a man-made cloud inside it. It pulls in warm air from outside that, when it hits the refrigerated cold air inside the device, turns into condensation. That water can then be stored in connected tanks. The pre-existing technology required a lot of electricity, though, meaning it wasn't cheap. The prize-winning version is powered by biogas, making it easy to operate almost anywhere. The biofuel gassifier creates renewable energy cheaply from cast-offs like wood chips, coconut shells, and dead plants, vaporizing the material to generate power. The system also generates a lot of heat, which is good for pulling water out of the air—think of how humid it is in the summer versus the winter. In the process of generating energy, the biogassifier also createsbiochar, a type of charcoal that can improve soil fertility. In places where biogas isn't a feasible option (like if there is no available wood or other fuel sources), the device could also be run on solar power or batteries. [h/tFast Company]"

297,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86501/5-strange-suggestions-about-how-fight-dust-bowl,,"It was a disaster of mankind’s own making. By the 1930s, chronic overfarming in the Great Plains had devastated the native grasses that had held topsoils in place. As the plants were uprooted, the dirt dried and loosened, setting the stage for anenvironmental catastrophe. In 1931, a drought hit the region—it would last eight years—and the exposed soil was blown away by a series of gigantic dust storms. Mountain-sized dirt clouds became a common sight all over Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. Nobody who lived there had ever experienced anything like it: skies were blackened, barnyards were buried, and millions of farmers became homeless refugees. As the crisis raged on, people piped up with some wild ideas about how to finally put an end to this “dust bowl.” Here are five of the most peculiar suggestions. Many well-meaning citizens assumed that if they could just cover up the loose dirt somehow, it would stop getting blown around so much. New Jersey’s Barber Asphalt Company reached out to the federal government and offered topave overthe afflicted area. Their price? Five dollars per acre. Sounds like a bargain—until you consider the fact that the dust bowl had engulfed around 100 million acres. Meanwhile, a Pittsburgh steel manufacturer wanted to install wire netting over multiple counties, and a company known as Sisalkraft proposed blanketing the ground with its rugged brand of waterproof paper. A similar idea involved laying concrete down over every field in the region and leaving a few holes for future crops. One North Carolinian’s suggestion ideally would have killed two birds with one stone. As environmental historian Donald Worsterwrotein his bookDust Bowl: The Southern Plains in the 1930s, “Mrs. M.L. Yearby of Durham, North Carolina saw an opportunity to beautify her own state by shipping its junked autos out to the plains to anchor the blowing fields.” Explosives expert Tex Thornton tried ending the drought withdynamite. In a sales pitch given to the citizens of Dalhart, Texas, he explained that if the explosive was launched skywards and detonated aerially, immediate rainfall would follow. Embracing Thornton’s idea, the town gave him $300 to cover his expenses. Judgment day came on May 1, 1935, when the would-be hero set up shop by a local lake. Thousands of curious onlookers watched from afar as Thornton tied balloons to his dynamite sticks, which had been fitted with timed fuses. Things quickly went awry once a violent dust storm arrived on the scene. The high winds made it too dangerous for Thornton to even think about releasing the explosives, especially now that a crowd was present. So in a last-ditch effort to deliver the goods, he buried his dynamite and set it off under the ground. Thornton’s Plan B backfired spectacularly: The blast just propelled extra dirt into the dusty atmosphere. After a few more attempts, raindidcome to Dalhart—as well as in regions too far away to be affected by his explosions. A victorious Thornton left Dalhart supposedlysaying,“I’m mighty glad that the people of Dalhart and the Panhandle got moisture—and if I had anything to do with it, I’m doubly glad."" Contemporary folklore claimed that if you hung a deceased snake belly-up over a fence post, it would rain the next morning. When all else failed, some farmers actuallytried thisduring the dust bowl years. Ironically, live snakes would have been far more useful to them. Back then, famished jackrabbits regularlyturned upin droves to devour the few crops that were still being grown on the Great Plains. In western Kansas, the situation was so bad that citizens responded by organizing what became known as “jackrabbit drives.” Those involved formed huge lines and marched side-by-side for miles on end. Using their own bodies, they’d corral every rabbit in sight into an enclosure and club them to death. Yet if the species’ natural predators—like certain snakes—had been a bit more common, this drastic measure might not have been necessary. Who knows? Many of the more intense showdowns in the American Civil War, including Gettysburg, were followed by severe rainfall. This and other accounts over the years helped give rise to the once widespread belief that artillery causeddownpours—a notion that was still fairly pervasive in the 1930s (and was broadly the same hypothesis that Thornton was working with). One soldier from Denver petitioned the federal government for$20 millionworth of ammunition, after which he would round up 40,000 members of the Civilian Conservation Corps for a couple of phony battles. After some non-lethal cannon fire, the rains would return—or at least, that was the plan. “Try it, if it works, send me a check for $5000 for services rendered,” wrote the soldier. This story originally ran in 2016."

But if someone did, you might be surprised that among the assorted bacteria and waste lurks something a little more disconcerting: traces of plastic. The disturbing revelation that humans are internalizing plastic material was announced this week at the United European Gastroenterology conference in Vienna. Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna found plastic in stool samples from eight donors, each from a different country (Poland, Russia, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, Austria, Finland, and Italy). The poop donors volunteered their excrement for the sake of science, shipping their deposits in biohazard packaging for lab evaluation under the direction of the Environment Agency Austria. All submitted samples tested positive for a variety of plastics, from polyethylene (found in storage containers) to polypropylene (bottle caps) to PVC. For each quarter-pound of the samples, 20 particles of microplastics were discoveredrangingin size from 50 to 500 microns. A 50-micron particle is thesmallestvisible to the human eye. Naturally, this means we have to be ingesting plastic in order to be excreting it. Scientists aren’t yet sure of the exact sources, though the food logs submitted by subjects might provide some clues. They drank from plastic bottles, ate from plastic containers, and ate fish that may have been exposed toplastic wastein polluted water. The discovery is likely to encourage more wide-ranging studies involving a greater number of individuals about the possible health effects of having plastic particles in our digestive systems or bloodstreams. It may also be a call to reduce our dependence on plastics in general, and for food-related purposes specifically. In the meantime, gratitude is due the researchers and microscopists who went through a lot of crap to retrieve this data. [h/tWIRED]"

That's right—sports mementos that would typically be sold for upwards of $50 in the U.S. are turned into reusable chopsticks in Japan. Each season, roughly 10,000 wooden bats are transformed into those ubiquitous eating utensils in an effort to cut down on waste and help preserve a threatened species of ash tree called the aodamo. Some bats are made from this material, although the practice is less common nowadays because the trees aren't readily available. Today, most are made from imported maple and white ash. Sports teams in Japan weren't always so eco-conscious, though. The broken bats used to be burned or given away until chief executive Hyogoo Uratani of the Hyozaemon chopsticks company came along. With help from a friend who had been a pro baseball player, they convinced 12 teams to start recycling their bats. It's a mutually beneficial deal, with Hyozaemon paying a licensing fee to the teams, and the Nippon Professional Baseball organization donating funds each year to the nonprofit Aodamo Preservation Society. They're also fun memorabilia to have on hand. A saw is used to break down the bats into smaller pieces, which are sanded into the shape of chopsticks.

Rainforest insects are dying off at alarming rates, according to a new study spotted by theThe Washington Post. In turn, the animals that feed off those insects are decreasing, too. In the study, published inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a pair of scientists from the Rensselaer Polytechnic University in New York and the National Autonomous University of Mexico studied populations of rainforest arthropods (an invertebrate classification that includes insects and spiders) in the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico. They compared the number of insects lead author Bradford Lister found on trips in 1976 and 1977 with the number he and co-author Andres Garcia found on trips they took between 2011 and 2013. Lister and Garcia used nets and sticky traps to collect insects on the ground and several feet above the ground in the forest canopy. They dried these captured bugs and measured the mass of their haul against the mass of insects found in the 1970s, finding that the modern net sweeps captured only an eighth to a fourth of the insects captured in the '70s. The mass of insects captured by sticky traps on the ground declined by 30 to 60 times what they were a few decades ago. They also tracked populations of lizards, frogs, and birds that live off those rainforest insects, finding that those populations had declined significantly, too, at levels not seen in other rainforest animals that don't rely on insects for food. Tropical insects are particularly vulnerable to climatic changes, since they can't regulate their body temperature. During the time of the study, average maximum temperatures in El Yunque rose by almost 4°F (2°C). The warming climate is ""the major driver"" of this decline in arthropod populations, the study authors write, triggering a collapse of the forest food chain. The paper has other scientists worried. ""This is one of the most disturbing articles I have ever read,"" University of Connecticut entomologist David Wagner, who wasn't involved in the research, toldThe Washington Post, calling the results ""hyper-alarming."" Otherstudiesof insect populations have found similarly dire results, including significant declines inbutterflies, moths,bees, and other species. One recentstudyfound that Germany's flying insect populations had decreased by as much as 75 percent in the last three decades. Scientists don't always attribute those population losses directly to warmer temperatures (habitat loss, pesticide use, droughts, and other factors might play a role), but it’s clear that insect populations are facing grave threats from the modern world. Not all insect species will beequallyaffected by climate change, though. While we may see a sharp drop in the populations of tropical insects, scientists project that the number of insects in other regions will rise—leading to a sharp increase incrop-eating pestsin some parts of the world and broadening mosquitos' geographicalrange.

The species, which lives in a handful of Mississippi ponds, is covered in dark spots and warts. But it's one of the world’s most endangered frogs—and its fate is currently being debated in the country's highest court. AsNature News and Commentreports, the Supreme Court started its new term on October 1, and one of the first cases on its docket involved the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has a plan to save the frog by restoring ponds 50 miles west in Louisiana, where the frogs once lived, and move the remaining populations there. The dusky gopher frog, otherwise known as the Mississippi gopher frog orLithobates sevosus, is threatened by development projects in Mississippi that have destroyed much of the amphibians' habitat. In 2012, the International Union for the Conservation of Naturenamed the frogone of the world's 100 most endangered species. Now, fewer than 100 of the frogs remain. Conditions are more suitable in Louisiana's ephemeral ponds because they dry out at certain times of the year and can't support fish, which eat frogs' eggs,The Washington Postreports. The problem? The Louisiana ponds' other characteristics are not quite as agreeable as those in Mississippi, and the 1500-plus acres of land in question are owned by a family that leases them to the Weyerhaeuser timber company. Weyerhaeuser is arguing that it isn't required to alter the land to accommodate the frogs, and that doing so would result in the property being devalued by millions of dollars. The Supreme Court is being asked to decide whether the government can designate privately owned land as a ""critical habitat"" even when the conditions are less than ideal for supporting an endangered species. Right now, the Endangered Species Act lets the government designate critical habitat only where the species can live and thrive in the present, not at some point in the future. The eight Supreme Court justices appeared evenly divided after hearing arguments this week, but they could wait to decide the case until a ninth justice is confirmed. This case is only the fifth challenge to the Endangered Species Act to be heard before the Supreme Court, but the FWS and other government agencies are trying to weaken the act's protections inother ways. The court's decision in the dusky gopher frog case could determine how the government manages endangered species in the future. [h/tNature News and Comment]"

To attract the most prevalent pollinators—bees, bumblebees, butterflies, hoverflies, and moths—Boelhouwer borrowed elements from real-life flowers. Her creations are colorful and symmetrical, which signal to insects that they're a good source of food.

There, he’d walk straight to the Monroe County Sheriff, Frank Knight, and deliver some unexpected news. “I’ve shot Guy Bradley,” he said. The reason, he’d later explain, had something to do with bird feathers. In 1889, a fisherman named George Elliott Cuthbertfound a feather that would change his life. For three days, Cuthbert had been canoeing through the Florida Everglades, bushwhacking a path through a buggy maze of mangroves in hopes of finding a treasure that would make him rich. As he paddled past the peering yellow eyes of alligators, Cuthbert noticed a white feather floating in the current and felt a rush of excitement. Following the feather, Cuthbert would stumble upon the treasure he’d been seeking. Thousands upon thousands of birds: Spoonbills, herons, wood storks, and snowy egrets—all eating, breeding, and squawking on a small hidden islet. This place, called a rookery, was undoubtedly one of the biggest bird breeding sites in North America, and it was beautiful, entrancing. “A flower, a beautiful white blossom,” is how Cuthbertdescribedit. He gazed at the birds in wonder. And then he began killing them. Cuthbert fired, fired, and fired again. Once the smoke dissipated, hundreds of birds were dead. Cuthbert smiled, paddled toward the floating carcasses, and skinned them. Later, he’d take a second trip and succeed in killing nearly all of the other birds on the island. He’d earn more than $50,000 in today’s money selling their feathers. The birds, which lived on an island now called Cuthbert Rookery, were martyrs to the whims of fashion. In the late 19th century, no fashion-conscious woman in New York or Paris could be seen without a hat bedazzled with bird feathers. This was especially true in New York, where “New Money” socialites wore feathered headwear—ornamented with a potpourri of flowers, ribbons, jewels, and the plumes of snowy egrets, calledaigrettes—astheway to flaunt their wealth and status. These hats sold for as much as $130, the equivalent of $3300 today. To meet demand, the millinery industry, which was based in New York, oversaw the killing of 5 million birds nationwide every year. It was a dream job for the rural poor; people such as Cuthbert could easily “shoot out” an entire rookery (that is, kill all the birds) in just a few afternoons. With feathers sometimes selling for $15 an ounce, a hunter could earn an entire year’s salary with just a few pulls of his index finger. In the late 19th century, there were no limits to how many birds a plume hunter could kill. In Cape Cod, 40,000ternswere killed for the hat industry in one summer. In Florida, the slaughter was often indiscriminate and senseless. One popular pastime among tourists visiting the Everglades was to shoot critters from the comfort of boats, plinking alligators and birds with no intention of ever picking up their carcasses. In southern Florida, bottomless plume hunting was a perfectly legal—and reasonable—way to make a living. Life in the swamps was difficult. The area had little arable land and no major industry. Residents made their money by fishing, fur trapping, harvesting sugarcane, or manufacturing charcoal. The demand for bird plumes offered a lucrative salary that no other job in the region could match. “Egret plumes are now worth double their weight in gold,” ornithologist Frank Chapmansaidin 1908. “There is no community sufficiently law-abiding to leave a bank vault unmolested if it were left unprotected. This is just the same.” Among the many people who raided that bank vault was Guy Bradley. Raised on the east coast of Florida, he spent his teenage years sailing through the mangrove forests of south Florida in search of plumes, discovering the best places to hunt and becoming well-acquainted with other hunters across the state. In 1898, the Bradley family moved farther south to Florida’s frontier, to a sparsely populated backwater town called Flamingo, which sat not far from the famed Cuthbert Rookery. Before making the move, they invited their friend Walter Smith to join them. Smith, an aging Confederate sharpshooter, accepted. Once settled in Flamingo, the friendship would become irrevocably strained. Twelve-hundred miles north in New York City, the political winds were shifting—and they would jolt the Everglades. “I don’t think in my reincarnation,if there is such a thing, that I want to come back to Florida,” Kirk Munroe, a Florida conservationist and personal friend of Guy Bradley, once said. “They are killing off all the plume birds. I remember when the spoonbills on the beach in front of my house made such a racket it was almost unpleasant. Now they are all gone—they never come back anymore.” In 1886, George Bird Grinnell, a conservationist and editor ofForest and Stream, formed the first major bird protection society, which he named after John James Audubon, the ornithologist and painter who published the groundbreaking bookThe Birds of America. Within a decade, independent Audubon societies would pop up across the northeastern United States, claiming supporters as prominent as then-New York governor Theodore Roosevelt. “The object of this organization is to be a barrier between wild birds and animals and a very large unthinking class, and a smaller but more harmful class of selfish people,” wrote William Dutcher, a businessman and ornithologist who’d become the National Audubon Society’s first president. Dutcher knew exactly who he was matched up against: The millinery industry employed 83,000 people and was worth $17 million. But Dutcher had friends in high places and believed he could convince politicians to pass legislation that could save America’s birds from extinction. He’d be a key lobbyist in helping pass the Lacey Act, which made it a federal crime to poach birds in one state and sell them in another. In 1901, he traveled to Tallahassee and successfully lobbied the Florida state government to pass a law protecting plume birds. With the help of state senator William Hunt Harris of Monroe County, an “Act for the Protection of Birds and Their Nests and Eggs, and Prescribing a Penalty for any Violation Thereof” waspassed, barring any person in Florida from killing plume birds or selling their feathers. It’s one thing to pass a law; another to enforce it. Most plume hunters lived in remote areas, hundreds of miles from the closest newspaper or courthouse. Dutcher knew that if the new law was going to be remotely meaningful, he’d need a warden who could enforce it—somebody who knew his way around Florida’s rookeries, who knew the tricks of the plume trade, who knew the plume hunters themselves. That man would end up being an ex-plume hunter: Guy Bradley. As Florida’s first bird warden,Bradley knew his job would become more dangerous as time wore on. At first, he’d be a one-man PR team: posting warning notices around the rookeries, distributing leaflets throughout villages, and meeting with Floridians to inform them of the law. Then eventually there’d come a time when everybody knew the law—and they’d either follow it or flout it. Bradley was worried about how best to approach these lawbreakers, people who would definitely be armed and angry when confronted. For example: One of Bradley’s neighbors, Ed Watson, was a rumored plume hunter—and a rumored murderer who supposedly shot and killed 50 people. To preserve the law and his own life, Bradley knew he’d have to tread gingerly. “It would be necessary for a warden to hunt these people and hunt them carefully for he must see them first, for his own sake,” he wrote in a letter. But the risk was worth it. Bradley was approached for the job in 1902, just as he was starting his life as a new family man. He had recently married a local woman, Fronie Vickers Kirvin, and the couple already had a baby, with a second on the way. The job not only promised Bradley and his family a steady income of $35 a month, it also offered him the dignity of becoming a law enforcement officer—a dream of his. (As a game warden, Bradley had to be sworn in by the Monroe County Justice of the Peace as a deputy sheriff.) Bradley’s first months in the field went rather smoothly. He convinced the Audubon Society to give his brother and brother-in-law positions as his deputies, allowing him to cover more ground. He was relatively close with the local Seminole and Miccosukee tribes and had an easy time convincing them of the benefits of the conservation law. Many local hunters who were at first dismayed to hear about the law accepted the reality of their situation and vowed to follow the rules. If anything, the thought of being slapped with a $15 fine and being called a “poacher” deterred them. A rare few, who worried about the palpable decline in local birdlife, openly welcomed the law. As Bradley wrote, “It is gratifying to me to see that a great many people are willing to abide by the law and even help me enforce it if they can.” Each day, Bradley trudged through the buggiest coves and inspected the remotest rookeries—including the replenished Cuthbert Rookery—where he accosted poachers shooting at the herons, flamingos, and snowy egrets. On a few occasions, men drew their guns and threatened to fire. But his biggest problems proved to be brewing in his backyard during his off-hours. Since arriving in Flamingo, Bradley’s friend Walter Smith had attempted to carve out a position as the town’s unofficial “boss.” In an effort to amass power and build political connections, he regularly traveled between the remote settlement and the seat of Monroe County—Key West—where he schmoozed with the movers and shakers of local government. Smith, however, was not very popular back home in Flamingo—and his power was rivaled by his neighbor, an outsize figure nicknamed “Uncle” Steve Roberts. The two regularly butted heads. In 1904, the Smith and Roberts clans started bickering over the location of their property line, with the Roberts family arguing that Smith was illegally squatting on their land. Eventually, the local surveyor determined that Smith was, in fact, trespassing. Smith took the case to court but lost. The local surveyor’s name? Guy Bradley. After the land dispute, things were never the same between Smith and Bradley. (Bradley’s sister had married into the Roberts clan, and Smith was convinced that—because of these familial connections—Bradley had been a biased surveyor.) The acrimony manifested in petty disputes, with both families refusing to help deliver each other’s mail or groceries. The tensions would eventually boil over into Bradley’s work. Smith, like many people in Flamingo, supplemented his income by hunting plumes, and he deliberately broke the law around Bradley. By late 1904, Bradley had arrested and fined the old man once. He had also arrested Smith’s eldest teenage son, Tom. This greatly aggravated the old sharpshooter. So when Bradley arrested Tom a second time, Smith approached the warden he once called “friend” and laid out his terms. “You ever arrest one of my boys again,” he said, “I’ll kill you.” “The natives are beginning to realizethat the birds are to be protected and that the wardens are fearless men who are not to be trifled with,” the ornithologists A. C. Bent and Herbert K. Jobwrotein 1904. “The Bradleys have the reputation of being the best rifle shots in that vicinity and they would not hesitate to shoot when necessary.” Guy Bradley carried a nickel-plated .32 caliber pistol and went to work each day ready to use it. After two years on the job, he had literally dodged a couple bullets. The ornithologist Frank Chapman feared for the warden’s safety. “That man Bradley is going to be killed sometime,” he wrote in a letter. Bradley’s efforts, however, were making a difference in southern Florida’s rookeries. “Under his guardianship, the 'white birds' had increased,” Chapmanwrote. The victories, however, came with a share of losses. It was impossible to cover 90 miles of coastline at once, and in the winter of 1904, Bradley approached the Cuthbert Rookery and found 400 carcasses floating in the water. “You could’ve walked right around the rookery on them birds’ bodies,” he said. The rookeries weren’t the only place receiving gunfire. In early 1905, Walter Smith and his family were eating supper when a hail of bullets tore through the home’s walls, forcing everybody to drop to the floor and panic. When the attacked ended, Smith accounted for his five children—no one was hurt—and poked his head outside. Nobody was there. No one knows who attacked the Smith household or why, but Smith was certain the assault had been coordinated by the Roberts clan and their ilk. Neighborly tension had escalated from pettiness to violence: With the lives of his children at risk, the hardened veteran was not willing to turn the other cheek. Months later, on the morning of July 8, 1905, Guy Bradley peered across the Florida Bay, looked toward the two small islands of Oyster Keys, and saw a blue schooner sitting in the mud of low tide. He immediately recognized the boat,The Cleveland, as belonging to Walter Smith. He also immediately recognized the sound of gunshots echoing from the islands: The Smiths were shooting a rookery, in plain sight of the warden’s house. For Bradley, it was time to get to work. He grabbed his pistol, kissed his wife goodbye, and launched his dinghy at 9 a.m. When Walter Smith saw Bradley approaching, he fired a warning shot into the clouds, signaling his boys—who were somewhere on the island shooting at birds—to return to the schooner. Bradley watched as the boys carried the bodies of two dead cormorants back to the boat. Tom Smith turned toward the rookery and fired his rifle into the nests. “[Tom] tended to flaunt what he was doing a bit,” historian Stuart McIver says inan episodeofWaterways, a public television program about the south Florida ecosystem. “If you were of a discreet [nature] about killing plume birds, Guy Bradley’s approach, from what I can gather, would have been to take you off to the side and talk you out of doing it again.” But the teenager wanted to make a fool of Bradley, and he made it a point to be seen defying the warden’s authority. McIver described the ensuing scene inhis book,Death in the Everglades. Bradley hollered at Walter Smith. “I want your son Tom.” Smith clutched his rifle. “Well, if you want him, you have to have a warrant.” Bradley shook his head. “I saw them shoot into the rookery and I see the dead birds. Put down your gun, Smith.” “You are one of those fellows who shot into my house and I’ll not put down my gun when you are near me. If you want him, you have to come aboard this boat and take him, “ Smith said. At this, Bradley clutched his pistol. Smith pointed his rifle at the warden. “Put down that rifle and I will come aboard,” Guy responded. What happened next is unclear, but Smith would later say that Bradley “never knew what hit him.” When Smith sailedThe Clevelandback to Flamingo,he told his family to pack up their belongings and get in the boat. “I’m going to Key West to give myself up,” he told them. “I’ve killed Guy Bradley.” In Key West, the sheriff charged Smith with murder and set bail at $5000. When word of Bradley’s death reached the Audubon Society, everybody assumed justice would prevail. Smith, after all, had openly admitted to killing a law enforcement officer. Senator William H. Harris—the same politician who helped push the bird law through the Florida legislature—was slated as the prosecutor. The case attracted the attention of newspapers across the country. “A group of rook killers concerned in the secret traffic of bird plumage shot him in order to kill as many birds as they liked …” reported theLos Angeles Herald. “[Smith], it is pleasant to note, will suffer the full penalty of the Florida law.” The reporters didn’t appear to know that Walter Smith had spent the past decade building political connections in Monroe County, where friends were encouraging him to open his purse strings and pay as much as possible for a lawyer who could reduce his prison sentence. Turns out, Smith’s money would get him much further. Somehow, he managed to lure Senator William H. Harris to switch sides, from the prosecution to the defense. Senator Harris, a local, knew that the grand jury would be composed of townsfolk—mostly poor fisherman and farmers—who opposed the bird-hunting law. He intuitively knew what talking points would resonate with them. So he repeatedly emphasized that Bradley was a bird warden and glossed over the fact that he was also an officer of the law. He argued that Smith was standing his ground in self-defense: Bradley, he claimed, had fired his weapon first. As Harris bent the jury to his will, the out-of-town state prosecutors put on a masterclass in incompetence. They presented no evidence and called only one witness to the stand, the firebrand “Uncle” Steve Roberts. Gene Roberts, the man who found Bradley’s body—and found Bradley’s unfired pistol—was never questioned. In December 1905, the grand jury dismissed the charges. Smith was set free. The Audubon Society would never replace Bradley. “Few responsible men, after the murder of Guy M. Bradley, are willing thus to jeopardize their lives, for, if the laws of the state cannot be enforced and criminals brought to justice, no man has a guarantee for his safety,” Laura Norcross Marrs, the Chairman of the Florida Audubon Society’s Executive Committee,wrotein 1906. Indeed, two more bird wardens would be killed. In 1908,Columbus McLeod’s boat went missing while he was patrolling Florida’s Charlotte Harbor. Weeks later, the sunken vessel was discovered weighed down by two sacks of sand. Nearby, McLeod’s hat was found containing two blood-stained gashes, which resembled axe marks. That same year,Pressly Reevesof South Carolina, an Audubon employee, was shot and killed. No arrests were ever made. With three deaths in as many years, the Audubon Society shifted focus from stopping poachers to stopping the millinery industry in New York. In 1910, Audubon lobbyists convinced New York state lawmakers to pass a bill forbidding the importation of plumes. That was followed by the Weeks-McLean Act in 1913, which banned the importation of wild bird feathers, and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, which made it illegal to sell or transport hundreds of species of birds. “It seems funny to have to say this,” McIver says onWaterways, “but [Bradley] probably did more for the cause by giving up his life, than if he had continued as before, if he just kept on being a warden for another 15 or 20 years.” His death, as well as the death of other game wardens, created so much palpable disgust that even the most ambivalent lawmakers were compelled to take action against the millinery industry. The final blow, however, came from the world of fashion. In1914, Irene Castle, an actress and dancer, had an appendectomy and cut her hair short before the surgery. When she returned to the limelight, her hair was bobbed—and audiences loved it. A trend was born. By 1920, film stars everywhere were flaunting short haircuts that made extravagant, feather-loaded hats look and feel awkward. By the roaring twenties, the plume business, like its victims, was dead. When John James Audubon visited the Everglades in the 1800s,heclaimedthat the wading bird population was so high that flocks would “actually block out the light from the sun.” This is how it must have felt after the plume trade’s demise—the wading bird population in the Everglades exploded. But only briefly. New threats would imperil the legacy Guy Bradley died for. Water diversion projects built in South Florida in the 1950s have since bled the area of vital freshwater, while climate change has caused Florida Bay to rise at least 6 inches since the mid-20th century. With freshwater choked to half its original levels and saltwater creeping, the ecosystem has deteriorated. Compared to the 1930s, the wading bird population in the Everglades today hasdropped90 percent. But there are efforts to combat this. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan—“the largest hydrologic restoration project ever undertaken in the United States,”according tothe National Park Service—aims to improve the freshwater flow into the area. The plan has cost upwards of $16 billion.Writingfor the National Parks Conservation Association, Laura Allen says, “The restoration’s success will be measured in birds.” So far, results have been mixed. In 2017, the Audubon Societyreporteddecent wading bird numbers, tallying more than 46,000 nests among seven species. This year’s census appear to show better numbers: Everglades National Park justreportedthe highest population of white ibis mating pairs in 70 years. Much more work, however, is needed to return the Everglades to their heyday as a birdland paradise. Guy Bradley started that job 116 years ago. It will take a continued effort to ensure that he did not die in vain. To learn more about Guy Bradley’s life and legacy, Mental Floss recommends Stuart McIver’sbook,Death in the Everglades."
312,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/555162/thick-arctic-sea-ice-near-greenland-has-broken-first-time-history,,"The sea off Greenland's northern coast has long been referred to as ""the last ice area.” The ice there is so old and thick that scientists believed the shelf would be the last to remain intact in the area in the face of climate change. Now, a new development is challenging that assumption: AsThe Guardianreports, the strongest sea ice in the Arctic has started to break apart for the first time in recorded history. The ice above Greenland owed its fortitude up to this point to the Transpolar Drift Stream. Ice from Siberia carried by the current collects on Greenland's coast, condensing to create a sturdy ice pack that's more than 13 feet thick, with ridges exceeding 65 feet in some places. The ice has remained whole at least since scientists started keeping satellite records of it in the 1970s, but an unusually warm and windy year has compromised its integrity. The breaking sea ice has been documented twice this year—once in February and once in August, both times when temperatures spiked above the averages for the region. The heatwaves weakened the ice and dislodged it from the coast, and warm winds pushed it further from land, creating a patch of open water larger than has ever before been observed in the Arctic. Temperatures will eventually drop back down and the gap will close up, but that won't be enough to reverse the damage. The ice has already been displaced to a spot where it will melt more easily the next time warm weather arrives up north. Climate scientists are rethinking how global warming might reshape the Arctic. Now that ""the last ice area"" has started to break up, experts are now saying the true last holdout of the region may be further west. Norwegian Meteorological Institute scientist Thomas Lavergne described the phenomenon as ""scary"" on Twitter. Less permanent sea ice meanspolar bearswill have fewer areas for hunting marine mammals, their main food source. New gaps in the ice can also trigger afeedback loop: While white ice reflects the Sun's heat, the dark ocean surface absorbs it, raising temperatures and causing ice to melt faster, feeding a perilous cycle. Arctic ice cover atboth poleshas been shrinking at a rapid rate in recent decades, with theLarsen Cbreaking off from Antarctica last summer and forming an iceberg the size of Delaware. Scientists predict that there will be no summer ice present in the Arctic Ocean at all starting some time in the next 10 to 30 years. [h/tThe Guardian]"

Rooks are a member of thecorvid family, a group of intelligent birds that also includes ravens and crows. At Puy du Fou, an educational amusement park with attractions inspired by various periods from French history, the rooks will flit around the park, pick up any bits of litter that haven't been properly disposed of, and deliver them to a receptacle in exchange for a treat. At least that's how the system is set up to work: The full team of six rooks has only been on the job sinceAugust 13. Employing birds as trash collectors may seem far-fetched, but the experiment has precedent. The Dutch startupCrowded Citiesrecently started training crows to gather cigarette butts using a vending machine-like device. Once the crows were taught to associate the rig with free peanuts, the machine was tweaked so that it only dispensed food when the crow nudged a cigarette butt resting on a ledge into the receptacle. The cigarette butts were eventually removed, and the birds figured out that they had to find the litter in the wild if they wanted to continue receiving their snacks. Crowded Cities had planned to conduct more research on the method's effectiveness, as well as the potentiallyharmful effectsof tobacco on crows, before bringing their vending machines to public spaces. Puy du Fou, meanwhile, has become one of the first—if notthefirst—businesses to fully implement the strategy on amajor scale. Even if it doesn't prove to be practical, Puy du Fou president Nicolas de Villiers told AFP that cleaning up the park is only part of the goal. He also hopes the birds will demonstrate that ""nature itself can teach us to take care of the environment."" [h/tAFP]"

This summer, the Maine Natural Areas Program—part of the state's Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry—located and documented examples of the plant near the town of Bowdoin. The plants were growing in a damp field on private property. While rare to spot,Aletris farinosais nativeto much of the southern and eastern U.S. and Ontario, Canada, and often grows in moist prairies and meadows. (Some of its close relatives grow elsewhere in the world, too. There are a number of species in the genusAletriathat grow in Asia.)Historically, it was used as a medicinal plant to treat digestive issues, among otherailments. Only three specimens of unicorn root have previously been collected and officially documented in Maine in the last 145 years: one in 1874 near the town of Brunswick, one in 1879 near the town of Wells, and one in 1887 near the city of Lewiston. It's not quite clear how the recently spotted specimen popped up in Bowdoin after years of no sightings. The seeds may have been buried underground for years and only recently turned up due to bulldozers or a fire shifting the soil around, as botanist Don Cameron of the Maine Natural Areas Program told theBangor Daily News. It's unclear what will happen to these particular plants now, since the field they are growing in is on private property, but Cameron noted that the property owner seems amenable to protecting the plant.

It’s hard to picture what thismeans, though, other than that we’ve all beensweaty. A new interactive graphic fromThe New York Timesmakes it easy to understand, for better or for worse. It allows you to plug in your hometown and birth year to see how many average days per year the temperature has reached 90 degrees throughout your lifetime. And then it projects how many of those extra-hot days will occur each year, on average, for the rest of the century. Say you were born in Los Angeles in 1985. That year, the LA area was projected to experience around 55 days of 90°F or higher. Today, that number has climbed to 67 days a year. By the time you reach 80 years old, there will likely be 81 to 99 of those extra-hot days. To get a sense of how climate change will affect younger generations, consider the plight of someone born in LA in 2000. That year, LA could expect 59 days a year of 90°F weather. By the time that person reaches age 80, they can expect to see an average of up to 103 days a year of that weather. Yeesh. And it will be worse for places that already experience a lot of hot weather. Someone born in New Delhi in 2000 can expect to experience an average of up to 243 days a year of 90°F or higher weather. That’s two-thirds of the year. It will be especially awful in tropical locations. By the end of the century, Jakarta, Indonesia will be 90°F or higher for almost the entire year.

AsForbesreports, the main tool that The Ocean Cleanup project is using to combat pollution is a 2000-foot floating net. The unit, dubbed System 001, will serve multiple functions. The floater sits on the water's surface, collecting any trash that bobs its way, while the 10-foot skirt that extends into the water blocks any waste from flowing beneath it. To catch as much garbage as possible, the net will need to be emptied every four to six weeks. As it collects debris, System 001 will also be able to collect data on climate and wave patterns.

Bees pollinate crops, and if bees go, then food resources could become limited. By some estimates, populations have been reduced by as much as30 percent, with certain states like Tennessee seeing an 80 percent loss of colonies in some years. There is no single cause forcolony collapse disorder; scientists believe disease, pesticides, and low species diversity in agriculture are making an impact. While pests and chemicals that kill them have long been thought to be culprits, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin say they’ve pinpointed a specific threat—one that could be sitting in your garage. In astudypublished inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, blame is being assigned to glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup. Glyphosate targets an enzyme found only in plants and some microorganisms and is not thought to be harmful to animals. But the paper argues that glyphosate is having an effect on the gut bacteria in bees, making them susceptible to sometimes-fatal infections. Researchers collected hundreds of honey bees from a single hive and gave some of them a solution with either 5 mg or 10 mg of glyphosate per liter, similar to concentrations found in the environment. Bees in the control group got a harmless solution of syrup. Researcher dabbed the dosed bees with pink paint to tell them apart. After three days, researchers observed that the glyphosate-dosed bees had less beneficial gut bacteria than the controls; one microbe that protects against infections had the biggest decrease. Two days later, the bees were introduced to a common pathogen,Serratia marcescens. Half of the bees with normal gut microbiomessurvivedthe resulting infection, while only a tenth of the glyphosate-exposed bees survived. Reacting to the study results, Bayer—which owns Monsanto, which developed Roundup—said that bees are not necessarily absorbing the same quantities of the chemical out in the open and criticized the study’s small sample size. Previously, glyphosate had beenlinkedto bees having an impaired sense of direction after exposure and having greater difficulty finding their way back to the hive. The chemical has also beenimplicatedas a possible carcinogen in humans. [h/tNPR]"

Those familiar plastic rings are notorious for thedangerthey pose to marine wildlife, as animals often get ensnared in them, starving to death when they get their mouths caught. While the common solution is to ask consumers to cut up the rings before placing them in the trash, that’s only a stop-gap measure. Now, Carlsberg has come up with a new plan to rid the world of plastic rings altogether. According toThe Telegraph, the Copenhagen-based beer producer has come up with a glued six-pack design that keeps beers together without adding extra plastic. The Snap Pack design keeps beer cans together with dots of glue. The bonds are strong enough to withstand the jostling of transport, but not so strong that you can’t break them apart. (Unlike the thicker plastic holders used by craft beer companies, which can bea nightmareto use.) The design took three years to perfect. Previously, a Florida-based brewery called Saltwater created an edible, compostable set of six-pack rings designed to make drinking beer a bit more dolphin-safe, but this eliminates the rings entirely. Considering that Carlsberg is one of the world’s top beer producers, the environmental benefit is pretty dramatic. The company estimates that the glued packs will reduce the amount of plastic used in traditional multi-packs of beer by more than 75 percent, saving around 1322 tons of plastic every year. The Snap Packs will make their debut in the U.K. in September 2018, before being rolled out to the rest of Europe and the world. [h/tThe Telegraph]"

DimitriNassisi's Drinking Hydrant doubles as a source of drinkable water for both people and their dogs. The pipes release water at two different pressures: fire-fighting strength and a gentler stream for drinking. Pushing the black switch on top of the blue fountain in one direction shoots out water that pedestrians can drink right there, and pushing it the other way activates a different faucet meant for filling water bottles. There's also a water dish built in to the bottom of the structure: Overflow from the spout fills the bowl so pets can drink from it. And should the hydrant ever need to be used for its original purpose, a nozzle on the side makes it easy for firefighters to access. Nassisi came up with the redesigned fire hydrant after taking his dog for a walk one day. He noticed that while there weren't many public places to refill a water bottle, fire hydrants were everywhere. He designed the Drinking Hydrant for his thesis project at the Swiss design school École cantonale d'art de Lausanne.

The findings were presented in a 92-page State of the World’s Fungi report, published by London’s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew [PDF]. The report cites recent studies showing that this particular fungus can help aid the disintegration of polyester polyurethane (PU)—a substance commonly used in refrigerator insulation, synthetic leather, and many other household products. Thestudy, by Chinese and Pakistani researchers, revealed thatA. tubingensisbroke down the plastic in just two months. Once the fungus attaches to a piece of plastic, it secretes enzymes that help the material degrade faster.

The rise ofwild beeandhoneybeepopulations in Amsterdam has also been linked to a ban against chemical pesticides on public land.

Recently, researchers at UCLA and other California institutionsdiscoveredan unwelcome squatter that might directly affect the spread of mosquito-borne disease. It’s the red swamp crayfish, a tasty delicacy often found in gumbo that may also be allowing mosquito populations to thrive. Native to the southeastern U.S., the crayfish are now found in California. While investigating their damaging ecological presence, scientists made a chilling observation: In streams where crayfish concentrations were high, there was a noticeable spike in the number of mosquito larvae. They found something else, too—a sharp decline in the larvae-eating dragonfly nymphs that they would expect to see in the area. In thepaper, published inConservation Biology, lead author Gary Bucciarelli observed 13 streams in the Santa Monica Mountains. Eight had crayfish populations and were high in mosquito larvae but low on dragonfly nymphs. Five crayfish-free streams had more nymphs and fewer larvae. In a lab experiment putting the crayfish, mosquitoes, and dragonflies in proximity, Bucciarelli watched as the dragonfly nymphs—normally happy to prey on mosquito larvae—kept their distance in the presence of crayfish, apparently spooked by the crustaceans. In the wild, high concentrations of crayfish appear to be interrupting the dragonflies' hunting habits, allowing more mosquitoes to roam unchecked. That’s not great news for humans. Mosquitoes arenotoriousfor spreading viral diseases like West Nile, Zika, and malaria. In Los Angeles, where the mosquito population could conceivably get a boost, 15 of the 16 mosquito species can harbor pathogens that pose a threat to public health. No one is quite sure how crayfish spread to the area—it’s possible fishermen used them as bait decades ago—but it's likely their presence will continue interfering with native species. In 2015, a nonprofit backed by the California Department of Fish and Wildlifestartedremoving crayfish from the Santa Monica streams using traps set by volunteers. The captured crayfish were sent to Malibu to become snack fodder for opossums and raccoons. But it’s a sizable task. Roughly 600 crayfish might be caught in a given day out of the millions thought to inhabit the waters. Conservationists might soon pursue more aggressive means to combat the crayfish's damaging ecological footprint. In addition to scaring dragonflies into inaction, they can threaten the integrity of underwater dams by burrowing and consume plants that help purify the water. h/tNational Geographic]"

In cities such as Shanghai, Rome, Barcelona, Bangkok, and New York, airports are even more vulnerable, with runways sitting less than about 16 feet above sea level. For decades, constructing airports on low, flat areas close to the water has made sense. These areas provide clear avenues for aircrafts to take off and land, and they can be close to the major hubs that airports serve while also being out of the way enough to reduce the potential for noise complaints. But the benefits of the geography come with unintended consequences, as was demonstrated the first week of September when Typhoon Jebi submerged the tarmac at the Kansai International Airport in Japan, stranding roughly 3000 travelers. And a storm doesn't need to reachdeadly levelsof intensity to ground flights: St. Paul Downtown Airport in Minnesota has been overrun by the nearby Mississippi River so many times that it now has a portable flood wall it can erect in flash flood situations. More airports are also responding to the growing threat of flooding with protective walls, pumps, and drainage systems of their own. Even if coastal airports are able to survive rising sea levels, global warming will still present them with new challenges. A hotter world means thinner air—which makes it difficult for planes to achieve lift-off.

So what advice does he have when his shipmates start to look a little green around the gills?Thrillistrecently reached out to him for an answer. Cousteau has seen a fellow sailor succumb to the nausea-inducing rocking of a ship many times. When this happens, he says the best thing to do is avoid the bow, or the front of the ship, but resist the urge to hide out below deck—away from any views of the ocean. Motion sickness occurs when the information sensed by our inner ear doesn't match up with what we see in front of us: In the case of sea travel, this could mean you feel the floor of the boat shifting beneath you while the wall of the galley appears to stay still. Rather than forcing yourself to forget where you are, Cousteau says the most effective approach is to embrace your enemy. Look out at the water and try to appreciate the sights. Staring intently at the horizon will also help re-balance what you're seeing with what you're sensing. Soon you won't be focusing on that queasy feeling in your stomach. “Suddenly, instead of not feeling well, they’re distracted by our profound connection to the oceans,"" Cousteau told Thrillist. And if all else fails and your boat is nowhere near dry land, Cousteau suggests a very Cousteau-esque solution: Slip on your scuba gear and get in the water.

The organization also runs the state's general container deposit-refund system, so customers can bring them to the same locations as any other recyclables. The thicker shape allows them to be separated out from other recyclables that get dropped off at bottle deposit sites, ensuring that they get sorted out to be refilled rather than recycled with standard glass bottles. Oregon passed the first state bottle bill in the nation in 1971 as a way to encourage recycling. In 2018, the stateincreasedthe bottle deposit from 5 cents to 10 cents, hoping to increase redemptions.

Measurements taken in August put it at 6879 feet. Since the second-tallest peak on the formation is made of rock and at a stable height, the reduction in the other peak's glacier has radically altered the hierarchy on Kebnekaise. While the glacial peak is still a few inches taller than its rocky counterpart, researchers expect it to lose its notoriety by the end of August as it continues to melt. Scientists say the transformation is an example of climate change in Northern Europe, which has been experiencing a heat wave that shows no signs of abating.

One of the most famous cases of a left-behind body on Antarctica dates back to the British Antarctic Expedition (also known as the Terra Nova Expedition) of 1910 to 1913. British explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his four-man team hoped to be the first ones to reach the South Pole in 1912, but were bitterly disappointed when they arrived and learned that the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them to it. On the return trip, Scott and his companions died of exposure and starvation while trapped by a blizzard in their tent, just 11 miles from a food depot. Two of those bodies were never found, but the others (including Scott’s) were located a few months after their deaths. Members of the search party covered their bodies in the tent with snow and left them there. The bodies have sincetravelled milesfrom their original location, as the ice grows and shifts around them.

However small and thin they may be, contact lenses can contribute to microplastic pollution in waterways when they’re not disposed of properly, according to a new study presented at the recent American Chemical Society national meeting in Boston. The study surveyed contact lens users and non-users, and found that 19 percent of users flush the lenses down the toilet or sink drain instead of placing them in the trash. That translates to about 3 billion contact lenses per year, Rolf Halden, a researcher at Arizona State University and one of the study's authors, toldThe Atlantic. Halden said he was inspired to look into the issue out of personal interest—he, too, wears contact lenses—and because he couldn’t find any studies on what happens to lenses after they’re flushed down the drain. Halden and his team discovered that the lenses end up in wastewater, where they can sink to the bottom because they are denser than water. There, they could endanger aquatic life, especially bottom feeders that may ingest the particles. Researchers also found that microbes in wastewater treatment plant systems can degrade the structure of the lenses themselves and break them into tinier pieces. In the larger environment, those bits could be consumed by every organism in the local food chain. In addition, some of the flushed lenses are turned into a treated sewage sludge that is ultimately used to fertilize crops, so the waste could end up in our soil and affect creatures like earthworms. The extent to which this affects humans' food supply is not currently known. ""Ultimately, we hope that manufacturers will conduct more research on how the lenses impact aquatic life and how fast the lenses degrade in a marine environment,” Halden says in astatement.

Take bus routes, for instance. In 1999, a Czech physicist namedPetr Šebafound the pattern in Cuernavaca, Mexico after observing how the city's bus system operated. Paid ""spies"" were positioned along the bus routes, and whenever a bus came, they'd let the driver know how long it had been since the last one passed through. Based on this intel, the bus driver would either slow down or speed up to maximize his passengers at the next stop. On paper, this method creates a barcode pattern of lines that appear to be placed at random but actually follow a set pattern. That same random-looking pattern appears elsewhere, too, like inchicken eyes. While the color-sensitive cone cells in the eyes of some animals, like fish, are laid out uniformly across the retina, the cells in chickens' eyes look different. The cone cells are different sizes and look like they're scattered at random. But these cells are actually distributed according to the universality pattern—the first-ever instance of the patternrecordedin biology. You can also see universality when you map out the energy spectrum of the uranium nucleus, the spectral measurements of sea ice, and elsewhere.

An estimated one in three people in the world don't have access to a toilet, and one in nine people don't have access to safe water (in large part because of that lack of toilets). A group of students from the University of British Columbia have come up with a new way to give people without plumbing clean, safe places to do their business, and according toCo.Designthe key is mushrooms. The MYCOmmunity Toilet, which just won the 2018 Biodesign Challenge, is a portable toilet kit designed for refugee camps that uses a mycelium (a mushroom product) tank to eventually turnhuman wasteinto compost. Everything needed to set up the toilet is packed into one kit, which users can set up into a small, sit-down toilet with a traditional seat and a tank for waste. The appliance is designed to fit into a refugee tent and serve a family of six for up to a month. The toilet separates solid and liquid waste for separate treatment. Enzyme capsules can be used to neutralize the smell of urine and start the decomposition, and poop can be covered in sawdust or other material to tamp down odors and rev up the composting process. After the month is up and the tank is full, the whole thing can be buried, and the mushroom spores will speed along the process of turning it into compost. The kit comes with seeds that can be planted on top of the buried toilet, turning the waste into new growth. (Biosolidshave been used to fertilize crops for thousands of years.) The University of British Columbia students—led byJoseph Dahmen, an assistant professor in the architecture school, and Steven Hallam, a professor in the department of microbiology and immunology—competed against 20 other design teams at the 2018 Biodesign Summit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in June, taking home first prize. They hope to further refine the prototype in the future, and according to Co.Design, test it out at local music festivals, which, with their outdoor venues and high volume of drunk pee-ers, are theperfect venueto stress test waterless toilet technology.

Fiber-optic cables that allow for the transfer of data areburied undergroundand adjacent to coastlines—where sea levels are likely to rise in the coming years, saturating the cables and causing damage. While some cables are run underwater and are housed in sheaths to prevent water from entering, cables buried underground were not intended to experience prolonged submersion. These affected cables—which measure more than 4000 miles in total length—will most likely become inoperable due to their exposure to damaging saltwater, corroding and losing the ability to transmit signals. The points where underwater cables connect to surface lines will also be vulnerable. Miami, New York, and Seattle are among the areas where connectivity could be most impacted. Paul Barford, Ph.D., a computer scientist and the lead author on the paper, toldPopular Sciencethat this service interruption is likely to become a growing problem within the next 15 years.

Circular Systems, a “clean-tech new materials company,” is transforming banana byproducts, pineapple leaves, sugarcane bark, and flax and hemp stalk into natural fabrics, according toFast Company. These five crops alone meet more than twice the global demand for fibers, and the conversion process provides farmers with an additional revenue stream, according to the company’swebsite. Fashion brands like H&M and Levi’s are already in talks with Circular Systems to incorporate some of these sustainable fibers into their clothes. Additionally, Circular Systems recycles used clothing to make new fibers, and another technology called Orbital spins those textile scraps and crop byproducts together to create a durable type of yarn. People eat about 100 billion bananas per year globally, resulting in 270 million tons of discarded peels. (Americans aloneconsume 3.2 billion pounds of bananas annually.) Although peels are biodegradable, they emit methane—a greenhouse gas—during decomposition. Crop burning, on the other hand, is even worse because it causes significant air pollution. AsFast Companypoints out, using leaves and bark to create clothing may seem pretty groundbreaking, but 97 percent of the fibers used in clothes in 1960 were natural. Today, that figure is only 35 percent. However, Circular Systems has joined a growing number of fashion brands and textile companies that are seeking out sustainable alternatives.

Six times a week, the now-defunct British Mediterranean Airways sent planes that were practically empty—save for crew members—from London to Cardiff, Wales, and back again the next day. And it all had to do with Heathrow's strict policing of runway rights, as YouTube channel Half as Interesting explains in the video below. Despite being the UK's largest and busiest airport, Heathrow only has two runways. For comparison, Chicago O’Hare International Airport, which sees roughly the same number of passengers, has seven. As a result, the 650 daily ""slot pairs"" that grant airlines the right to take off and land at Heathrow are costly and hard to come by. They also tend to command sky-high prices when they're traded and sold. Oman Air, for instance, paid $75 million for a prime early morning slot in 2016. Airlines have to use their slot at least 80 percent of the time over a six-month period, lest it be forfeited to another airline. So when British Mediterranean’s service from London to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, was abruptly canceled, it scrambled to ensure it wouldn’t lose its slot at Heathrow. Hence the ghost flights. Environmentalists, of course, were less than pleased with the fact that each 140-mile flight resulted infive tonsof CO2 being released into the atmosphere, according to the BBC. The ghost flights eventually ended and British Mediterranean Airways wassoldafter suffering a series of losses. As Half as Interesting notes, although extreme cases like these aren't as common anymore, some airlines schedule cheaper flights more often in the winter to ensure they’re making full use of their slot. And Heathrow is once again taking some heat fromenvironmentalists. The airport is planning toexpandby adding a third runway, which sparked protests outside the Houses of Parliament last month.

As experts were figuring out the best ways to handle the ecological disaster, a hairdresser from Alabama named Phil McCroy was tinkering with ideas of his own. His solution, a stocking stuffed with hair clippings, was an early version of a clean-up method that's used at real oil spill sites today, according toVox. Hair boomsare sock-like tubes stuffed with recycled hair, fur, and wool clippings. Hair naturally soaks up oil; most of the time it'ssebum, an oil secreted from our sebaceous glands, but it will attract crude oil as well. When hair booms are dragged through waters slicked with oil, they sop up all of that pollution in a way that's gentle on the environment. The same properties that make hair a great clean-up tool at spills are also what make animals vulnerable. Marine life that depends onclean furto stay warm can die if their coats are stained with oil that's hard to wash off.

341,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/549244/dangerous-plants-that-can-kill-or-maim,,"Though most of us know we shouldn't make meals out of strange plants we come across in the wilderness, we probably wouldn't think twice about touching those with shiny fruit and appealing colors, assuming them to be as safe as they are beautiful. But there are many trees, flowers, and berries that can cause great bodily harm through mere contact—agonizingly itchy rashes, respiratory issues, temporary blindness, and even total organ failure. While some fatal flora have to get inside your body to kill you, others are so dangerous that you probably shouldn’t even stand next to them. Here are some of the most notorious. The manchineel, orHippomane mancinella, is a relative of the poinsettia and holds the Guinness WorldRecordfor “most dangerous tree.” Pretty muchevery partof this plant—which is native to Florida, as well as parts of the Caribbean and Central and South America—is out to get you: Its fruits are known in Spanish asmanzanilla de la muerte, or “little apple of death,” and its sap, once used to poison arrows, contains the toxinphorbol, a carcinogen. Contact with the sap causes a blistering, painful rash that can last for weeks, which means you don't want to stand under the tree in a storm; raindrops can pick up the sap and drop it onto your unprotected skin. You shouldn't try to destroy the manchineel, either—inhaling smoke from burning its leaves can lead to respiratory issues or even temporary blindness.Accordingto the Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, “interaction with and ingestion of any part of this tree may be lethal.” The rosary pea (Abrus precatorius), also known as crab’s eye or jumbie bead, is a perennial climbing vine whose small seeds are astonishingly deadly: They contain a toxic protein called abrin that is so poisonous, a single seed can kill you within 36 hours. In the tropical regions where they're found, rosary peas are also used to make jewelry, because nothing says “pretty necklace” like possible death. The good news is that simply handling a rosary pea seed won’t be fatal; the hard coating surrounding the seeds, which are usually bright orange or red with a black spot, needs to be broken for poisoning to occur by inhalation or absorption. You’ll even survive swallowing one. Chew it, however, and you’re in for a fun ride of vomiting, liver failure, and death. The rosary pea’s most common victims are children and, well, jewelry makers: Prick a finger while drilling a hole in the small seed, and that necklace will be your last. Don't let its cutesy name or heart-shaped foliage fool you: The gympie-gympie (Dendrocnide moroides) is not to be trifled with. The leaves and fruits of this poisonous nettle, native to Australia, Indonesia, and the Moluccas, are covered with hollow stinging “hairs” shaped like hypodermic needles that are notoriously difficult to remove from skin. Moroidin, the neurotoxin found in the gympie-gympie plant, causes painful itching so excruciating that it’s been known to drive humansmadwith agony. Simply breathing near the plant can cause nosebleeds and rashes due to the inhalation of shed needles. “The first thing you’ll feel is a really intense burning sensation and this grows over the next half hour, becoming more and more painful,” virologist Mike Leahy describes in avideoin which he intentionally stings himself with the gympie-gympie. “Shortly after this, your joints may ache, and you might get swelling under your armpits, and that can be almost as painful as the original sting. In severe cases, this can lead to shock, and even death. And if you don’t remove all the hairs, they can keep releasing the torturous toxins for up to a year.” Entomologist and ecologist Marina Hurleydescribescoming in contact with a plant—which she did many times—as “being burnt with hot acid and electrocuted at the same time.” And even with repeated exposure, your system never adapts; symptoms only get worse over time. The pain is so bad that during WWII, an Australian army officer reputedly killed himself after realizing he had accidentally used the plant’s leaves as toilet paper. It's also worth noting that age doesn't diminish the danger: Dry samples, preserved for decades, still retain their stinging abilities. Aconite (Aconitum napellus), more commonly known as wolfsbane, is a flowering perennial that grows in mountain meadows in the Northern Hemisphere. Like the manchineel tree, it has historically been used to poison arrowheads for hunting. Aconite contains large quantities of pseudaconitine, a toxin that can paralyze an animal as large as a whale, allowing it to be brought down by hunters. Like the manchineel tree, wolfsbane causes its fair share of accidental deaths. In 2014, a gardener in Hampshire, England, was rushed to the hospital after handling the plant without protective clothing. The toxin entered his blood, causing multiple organ failure, and within five days, he was dead. Chelsea Physic Garden representativeTom Wellscalls wolfsbane one of the most dangerous plants found in Britain’s gardens: “The roots are where the highest level of poison is found, although it is still found in the flower. If there were cuts on his hand, it would enter his bloodstream and affect his heart very quickly,” causing arrhythmia or paralysis. The Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) kills with an even more brutal touch, though at least it's not intentionally trying to murder people. Growing up to 130 feet tall in the rainforests and mountains of Australia, the ancient pine (dating back 350 million years) produces massive, watermelon-sized cones weighing up to 22 pounds … which it then drops on unsuspecting victims below. “These huge pine cones have the capacity to be lethal if they were to fall on someone passing underneath from such a large height,” Baw Baw Shire Council Mayor Diane Blackwoodsaidin 2012, when a Bunya pine planted by a restaurant troubled local residents. According toThe Conversation, many councils rope off areas by the pines or erect warning signs during “cone season.” If you’re ever in Australia between December and March, watch your head. White snakeroot (Ageratina altissima) is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern and central North America that was responsible for the deaths of thousands of European settlers in the 19th century. Consumed by cows and other livestock, the plant's leaves and stems contain a toxin called tremetol that was passed on to humans through the animals' milk. This “milk sickness” manifests as vomiting, tremors, liver failure, constipation, delirium, and often death—of both humans and calves who drank the tainted milk. Perhaps the most famous victim of white snakeroot wasNancy Hanks Lincoln, mother of President Abraham Lincoln. Modern animal husbandry practices have mostly made milk sickness a thing of the past; the plant is cleared so animals can't graze on it. Oleander (Nerium oleander) is widely cultivated and flourishes in subtropical and mild oceanic climates. The flowering evergreen shrub is prized by gardeners and usually grows to 6 to 12 feet tall. It’s alsochock fullof toxins. Cardiac glycosides called oleandrin and neriine are found in oleander’s flowers, leaves, roots, and fruit, and while similar compounds are used to treat heart failure by helping the muscle to pump blood, oleander can alsostop your heart. (Additional symptoms include skin rashes, visual disturbances like blurred vision and halos, and bloody diarrhea.) The good news is that you’ll likely vomit immediately after ingesting the plant, giving you a second chance at life. Those with hardy stomachs, beware. The invasive giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) grows all over the world, from Europe to Australia, and its corrosive sap contains the phototoxin furocoumarin. Touching the plant followed by any exposure to ultraviolet light causes a reaction calledphytophotodermatitis, a rash so severe it is often mistaken for chemical burns. It can also cause permanent blindness if the photosensitive chemicals come in contact with your eyes. The giant hogweed's effects are insidiously long-lasting: Blisters from the rashes and third-degree burns it inflicts can take months to heal, and the affected area may remain photosensitive for years after exposure."

They have been known to reduce people's stress and improve overall mental health, and according to one2015 study, a walk in the woods can make you feel seven years younger. They also do a great deal of good for the environment by mitigating air pollution and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These benefits aren’t just felt in rural areas, either. A new study by researchers at University College London found that the trees in the London borough of Camden store as much carbon per hectare as rainforests,Fast Companyreports. A tree’s ability to soak up carbon dioxide during photosynthesis is especially useful when the tree is in an urban area, where industrial activity—and the burning of fossil fuels—tends to be more prevalent. For thestudy, published in the journalCarbon Balance and Management, the researchers used laser scanning methods to take their own carbon readings of trees from the ground as well as the air, and then compared their findings with publicly available Lidar (light detection and ranging) data from the UK Environment Agency. They were then able to estimate the biomass of 85,000 trees in Camden, where the university is based. They determined that Camden had a median carbon density of around 55 tons of carbon per hectare (t/ha). Greener areas of the borough, like Highgate Cemetery, had a carbon density of 380 t/ha—levels that are typically seen in tropical rainforests. For comparison, major cities in the U.S. have carbon densities of 7.7, and in China the figure is 21.3. So what exactly does this mean? Trees could theoretically help offset global warming by removing carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) from the air and storing it as biomass, thereby cooling the atmosphere. However, some climate scientists argue that it’smore complicatedthan that, and any impact felt by tree-planting initiatives today may not be seen for decades. Still, with all of the other benefits trees offer, planting a seed or two couldn't hurt. [h/tFast Company]"

Insects and acid rain also pose a threat to the facade, which is already crumbling away in some parts.

Though there's plenty of seismic activity that happens out in the middle of the ocean, most detection equipment is located on land, with the exception of a few offshore sensor projects in Japan, the U.S., and Canada. To get better earthquake data for tremors and quakes that happen far from existing sensors, a group of scientists in the UK, Italy, and Malta suggest turning to the internet. AsScience Newsreports, thefiber-optic cablesalready laid down to carry communication between continents could be repurposed as seismic sensors with the help of lasers. The new study, detailed in a recent issue ofScience, proposes beaming a laser into one end of the optical fiber, then measuring how that light changes. When the cable is disturbed by seismic shaking, the light will change. This method, which the researchers tested during earthquakes in Italy, New Zealand, Japan, and Mexico, would allow scientists to use data from multiple undersea cables to both detect and measure earthquake activity, including pinpointing the epicenter and estimating the magnitude. They were able to sense quakes in New Zealand and Japan from a land-based fiber-optic cable in England, and measure an earthquake in the Malta Sea from an undersea cable running between Malta and Sicily that was located more than 50 miles away from the epicenter. Seismic sensors installed on the sea floor areexpensive, but they can save lives: During the deadly Japanese earthquake in 2011, the country's extensive early-warning system, including underwater sensors, was able toalertpeople in Tokyo of the quake 90 seconds before the shaking started. Using existing cable links that run across the ocean floor would allow scientists to collect data on earthquakes that start in the middle of the ocean that are too weak to register on land-based seismic sensors. The fact that hundreds of thousands of miles of these cables already crisscross the globe makes this method far, far cheaper to implement than installing brand-new seismic sensors at the bottom of the ocean, giving scientists potential access to data on earthquake activity throughout the world, rather than only from the select places that already have offshore sensors installed. The researchers haven't yet studied how the laser method works on the long fiber-optic cables that run between continents, so it's not ready for the big leagues yet.

TheSvarthotel, which is being billed as the world’s first ""energy-positive"" hotel, is designed to “set a new standard in sustainable travel,” according toRobb Report. Built by a tourism company calledArctic Adventure Norwayand designed by Snøhetta, an international architecture firm headquartered in Oslo, it’s one of thefirst buildingscreated according to the standards ofPowerhouse, a coalition of firms (including Snøhetta) devoted to putting up buildings that will produce more power over the course of 60 years than they take to build, run, and eventually demolish. It will be located on a fjord at the base of Svartisen, one of the largest glaciers on Norway’s mainland and part of Saltfjellet-Svartisen National Park. The design of the hotel is geared toward making the facility as energy-efficient as possible. The architects mapped how the Sun shines through the mountains throughout the year to come up with the circular structure. When the Sun is high in the winter, the terraces outside the rooms provide shadows that reduce the need for air conditioning, while the windows are angled to catch the low winter Sun, keeping the building warm during cold Arctic winters. In total, it is expected to use 85 percent less energy than a traditional hotel. Svart will also produce its own energy through rooftop solar panels, though it won’t have excess energy on hand year-round. Since it’s located in the Arctic Circle, the hotel will have an abundance of sunlight during the summer, at which point it will sell its excess energy to the local electricity grid. In the winter, when it’s too dark for solar energy production, the hotel will buy energy back from the grid. Over the course of the year, it will still produce more energy than it uses, and over time, it will eventually produce enough excess energy to offset the energy that was used to build the structure (including the creation of the building materials). “Building in such a precious environment comes with some clear obligations in terms of preserving the natural beauty and the fauna and flora of the site,” Snøhetta co-founder Kjetil Trædal Thorsen explains in the firm’sdescriptionof the design. “Building an energy-positive and low-impact hotel is an essential factor to create a sustainable tourist destination respecting the unique features” of the area.

While that talent only exists in movies, we humans and our everyday activities do indirectly influence the weather in ways that go far beyond our production of greenhouse gases. Climate scientists and meteorologists have documented these effects for years. They're not exactly wrong when they call the capital of Georgia ""Hotlanta."" Most populated areas generate heat simply by existing. The dense web of asphalt roads, concrete sidewalks, brick facades, and tar roofs are able to absorb a significant amount of heat from the daytime sun, even in the dead of winter. This human-made insulation, called the urban heat island effect, keeps city centers a tad hotter on hot days and a little less cool on cold days. While the urban heat island effect might make you think of burning-hot asphalt, it's actually most noticeable during winter storms when air temperatures are hovering right around freezing, putting you right on the line between wet snow, an icy mix, or a cold rain. The artificial warmth from cities can influence the precipitation type in these storms, potentially lowering a city’s snow accumulations compared to its suburbs. A 2011 study published in theJournal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology[PDF] also found that the urban heat island effect can have a pronounced impact on thunderstorms that form over cities. The researchers studied 91 summertime thunderstorms that formed over Indianapolis, Indiana, and found that their research models could not replicate those thunderstorms without the influence of the urban area beneath the storms. If cities can absorb the heat of the day and make it even hotter, you can imagine how the vast swaths of crops that blanket the countryside can also affect our daily weather. Instead of making it hotter, crops can make a humid day unbearable by sending moisture levels almost off the charts on a putrid summer's day. Corn crops arenotoriousfor pushing dew points—the temperature at which the air reaches 100 percent humidity—up above 80°F in the middle of the summer, creating a dangerous heat index that soars far above 100°F. Compare that to a muggy day, which has a dew point around 70°F, or a comfortably dry day with a dew point in the low 50s. The harvest can have the opposite effect. In 2016,Mesonet, a network of weather stations in Oklahoma, found that newly harvested areas of wheat in the northern part of the state were hotter and had a lower dew point than their cooler but muggier surroundings. Our obsession with construction doesn't stop at influencing temperatures. Paving over porous earth with relatively impervious materials like asphalt and concrete has also had a major impact on flooding during heavy rain events. Fewer places for rainwater to escape means that the sudden influx of water builds up in urban areas or runs off and inundates places that had never seen flooding before. Lake effect snow is a yearly phenomenon across North America’s Great Lakes, where bitterly cold air flows over the warm lake water, triggering convection that blows ashore as heavy bands of snow. The bands of snow are so intense that communities can see many feet of snow in one day, sometimes accompanied by thunder and lightning. It's not only bodies of water that can cause this phenomenon. Nuclear power plants release large amounts of steam during the course of their operations, and on cold mornings when there's enough moisture in the air, locations immediately downwind of a power plant's steam stacks can experience ""nuclear-effect snow,"" which forms through similar means as lake effect snow. The phenomenon isn't limited to just nuclear power plants, but they produce enough steam that it’s noticeable over a large area. Thankfully for residents nearby, it doesn't produce much snow—and it’s not radioactive. If you've ever walked down a city street on a windy day, you’ve probably noticed that it sometimes feels like you're being buffeted by air shot out of an industrial fan instead of a regular windstorm. Dense building construction can amplify the winds and cause gusts to blow much faster than they would out in the open. This wind tunnel effect can cause serious damage, blowing out windows, knocking down trees, and sending dangerous debris hurtling toward the busy streets below. The principle is the same as holding your thumb over the end of a garden hose to make the water spray out faster—the wind speeds up dramatically as it presses between the buildings. This is also why you should never take shelter underneath a bridge during a tornado. The tornadic winds squeezing underneath the bridge will speed up, increasing the odds that you’ll be pelted by debris or sucked out into the open. The simple act of flying can also create intricate patterns of clouds in the sky that wouldn't have formed had we not perfected the art of air travel. The hot water vapor produced by the engine exhaust of a high-flying jet aircraft leaves contrails, short for condensation trails, in its wake. Contrails can dissipate right away or linger for hours depending on upper-level humidity and winds. These man-made cirrus clouds are most common at high cruising altitudes, but places like the Arctic and Antarcticget cold enoughthat contrails can form at or near ground level.

But if you are an avidrecycler, you might also feel a sense of guilt throwing away electronics, furniture, toys, and other home goods that arealmostusable but just need some love from an experienced professional to get working again. Repair Cafe,asCityLabreports, is a network of volunteer organizations that help people fix their broken products. The first Repair Cafe got its start in Amsterdam in 2009, when Martine Postma opened up the first cafe dedicated to helping people fix up their broken products. Experts are available to help look at malfunctioning electronics, broken jewelry, busted vacuums, and other everyday items, helping the owner troubleshoot the problem and get everything working again. The goal is to prevent as many of these products as possible from ending up in the trash, and it's free for anyone to attend. While the cafe provides access to knowledgeable experts and some tools and supplies, the goal is to help individuals learn to fix their household goods on their own. Due to the success of the Amsterdam cafe, Postma founded the Repair Cafe Foundation to bring her idea to cities around the world. There are currently more than 1500 volunteer Repair Cafes internationally. Anyone can start one, in fact. For less than $60 (€49), the organization provides a step-by-step manual, logo use, templates for advertising posters and liability forms, and other support. If there aren't any Repair Cafesnear youright now—and you don't plan to open one—consider investing in products that come withlifetime guarantees. (If you don't know where to find those, starthere.)

That's not likely to change now that there's a exotic new species that can not only self-replicate, but is also poised to attack animals like a colony of swarming fire ants. This super-tick isHaemaphysalis longicornis, or the longhorned tick, native to East Asia and imported to the U.S. by unknown means. The first North American sighting took place in August 2017 in New Jersey when a farmer walked into a county health officecoveredin nearly 1000 ticks after shearing a pet sheep that had been infested. The insect was then spotted in Virginia, West Virginia, and Arkansas, with caution advised in Maryland. As ofthis week, it’s now a confirmed resident of North Carolina,The Charlotte Observerreports. H. longicornisinvites more dread than a conventional tick forseveral reasons. It can “clone” itself, with females laying up to 2000 genetically identical eggs without any assistance from a male, a process called parthenogenesis. Reproduction is faster, with offspring appearing in just six months compared to two years for common deer ticks. It’s also an aggressive biter, nibbling on any animal flesh it can latch on to, and is able to transfer a host of diseases in the process—some of them fatal. In addition toLyme, longhorned ticks can transmit the flu-like ehrlichiosis bacteria and the rare Powassan virus, which can cause brain inflammation. The news isn’t much better for livestock. Given enough opportunity, the ticks can siphon enough blood from an animal to kill it, a process known as exsanguination. The attack can become so concentrated that pets have been spotted with ticks hanging from them like bunches of grapes. New Jersey officials have confirmed the tick has survived the winter by burrowing underground, a somewhat ominous sign that the invasive species might be durable enough to become a widespread problem. Experts recommend taking all the regularprecautions, including wearing long pants when outdoors, using repellent, and examining yourself and your pets for ticks. While the longhorned tick hadn’t yet displayed a taste for human flesh, it’s better to be safe than sorry. As for the sheep: following a chemical treatment, she made a full recovery.

352,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/549929/startups-simple-chemical-process-could-break-down-plastics-we-cant-recycle,,"When most people think of plastic taking up space in landfills for centuries, they might picture PET, the plastic used to make water bottles. But the thin film plastic used for bags and packaging is far more abundant, and it's much more likely to get contaminated with food and oils, making it harder to salvage for recycling. Now a startup calledBioCellectionsays it's found a way to get more use out of these plastics by melting them down into organic liquids,WIREDreports. Before most plastic can be recycled, it first needs to be cleaned. In areas with high quality standards, it's not unusual for especially dirty plastics to be thrown away altogether. The method developed by BioCellection works on film plastic no matter how greasy or sticky it is. As Miranda Wang, one of the company's co-founders, tellsWIRED, the plastic just needs to be shredded, loaded into a glass container, and soaked in a clear liquid catalyst at 248°F for the chemical reaction to take place. In the presence of the catalyst, the polymer chains in the plastic break down into many different compounds with two to seven carbons per chain link. The result isn't just melted plastic—it's organic liquids that can be repurposed to make new materials. Adipic acid, one of the resulting compounds, can be used to manufacture nylon clothing and car parts. As the world's plastic waste continues topile up, scientists are scrambling for new ways to break it down. In2016, Japanese scientists discovered a type of bacteria that munches on non-biodegradable plastic, andtwo yearslater another team accidentally engineered that same bacteria to be more efficient. BioCellection initially turned to plastic-eating bacteria when looking for ways to break down plastic film, but soon found that the microbes were much more interested in the food contamination. The liquid catalyst presented a way around this. The new plastic-degrading process isn't ready to be applied on a large scale, but BioCellection plans to have a machine capable of breaking down 5 metric tons of plastic a day ready by 2019. The team is also interested in expanding the method to other materials like rigid polyethylene plastics. [h/tWIRED]"

In addition to businesses like Starbucks andMcDonald’sbanning plastic straws, scientists have been working on their own alternatives to unrecyclable plastic wrap. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have used discarded crab shells and tree fibers to develop a material akin to plastic cling wrap, according toIFL Science. The crustaceans' shells contain a substance called chitin, which is the second most abundant polymer found in nature, researcherswrotein a study published inACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering. Cellulose, which is often used to make paper and certain fabrics, is the most common natural polymer, and scientists say it could be sourced sustainably from the paper industry. The material is created by spray-coating a polylactic acid (PLA) base with these two materials in alternating layers. “The chitin and the cellulose are oppositely charged,” Carson Meredith, lead author of the paper, said in avideo. “That allowed them to build nice sub-layers as they’re coated and create dense, thin films that block the transmission of oxygen.” It’s similar to petroleum-based plastic packaging, but researchers say their cling wrap could keep foods fresher for a longer period of time because less oxygen penetrates the material. The Georgia researchers aren’t the only ones turning to the lab to tackle the issue ofplastic waste. Other pseudo plastics have been created by transforming the sugars in corn starch, cassava, and sugarcane into PLA, which is biodegradable. Another biodegradable material calledpolyhydroxyalkanoate(PHA for short) is a natural product of some microorganisms. However, according to Columbia University, a 2010 study on these bioplastics revealed that their production may be a greater source of pollution than traditional plastics, so their use might not be a surefire solution either.

354,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/550594/facts-about-cows,,"Cows dot fields and pastures across many countries. Their products—which can bepreservedfor extended use, such as butter, cheese, and smoked or cured meats—are valued and consumed worldwide. And, scientists are still findingnew usesfor the roughly 80 pounds of manure that a dairy cow produces daily. Chew the cud over these 10 facts about bovines. AsABC Newsreported, a2012 studypublished inWilderness and Environmental Medicinefound that cattle cause an average of 22 deaths per year.Sharks, on the other hand, kill about six people per year. It sounds like SyFy should have madeCownadoinstead. It might be funny to imagine a sleeping cow falling over with just a gentle shove, but cow tipping isn't that easy. Actually,it's nearly impossible. Cows sleep lying down and are generally wary of approaching humans, so they're never really blissed-out enough to allow a stranger to get close enough to touch them. But the bigger obstacle is their sheer size. Cows are massive—on average 1500 pounds—and balance their weight on all four legs. Cow stomachsare made up of four pouches—the reticulum, the rumen, the omasum, and the abomasum—each serving a specific purpose. Cows barely chew their food before it enters the rumen, the first and largest part of the stomach. Once the rumen is full, the cow lies down and the reticulum—which is made of muscle and is connected to the rumen so food and water can easily pass back and forth—pushes the unchewed food back up the esophagus and into the mouth. After re-chewing, or rumination, the food eventually passes through the omasum. The omasum filters out the water and gives the bacteria in the rumen more time to break down the food and take in more nutrients. Finally, the food enters the abomasum, which functions similar to a human stomach. Transferring embryos from a genetically superior cow to a merely adequate cow is becoming more common. The procedure—known asembryo transfer(ET)—involves injecting a superior cow with hormones so she produces multiple eggs. Her eggs then need to be fertilized, either naturally or through artificial insemination. When the eggs are fertilized, a vet performs an “embryo flush” to remove them. That generally results in six to seven usable embryos, but can produce as many as 80 or 90. Without hormone treatment, a cow can only produce one embryo. According to theMerriam-Websterdictionary, the origin of cattle ischatel, the Anglo-French word for personal property. Chatel comes from the Medieval Latin termcapitale. There are specific terms for bovines depending on their age, sex, and purpose. For example, a “bull” is a mature, male bovine used for breeding, while a “steer” is a male that's been castrated and is used for its beef. A “heifer” is a female bovine that has yet to have calves, and a “bred heifer” is a pregnant heifer. There are a number of additionaltermsthat farmers use to describe members of their herd. A bullfighter could just as easily wave a pink or purple flag to get a bull to charge. The bull isn'tangered by the color—all bovines are red/green colorblind. Instead, it's the movement of the cloth that gets it all riled up. The real reason matadors wear red: to hide the bull's blood. If farmers have a good relationship with their cows—meaning theygive them namesand show enough affection—they can produce more milk than their lonely counterparts. A 2009 study from Newcastle University found that cows who are more comfortable around humans are less stressed when milked. When cows are stressed, they produce cortisol, a hormone that inhibits milk production. Another plus side of a happy cow-human relationship: farmers are less likely to get injured on the job (see fact #1). For the 2014 film, director Rob Marshall wanted to use a real, live cow instead of depending on CGI. James Corden, who played the Baker and spent plenty of time with his bovine costar, admitted that things didn't always go smoothly: “You just don't know what it's like when you're doing a scene, and Meryl Streep is giving a phenomenal performance in only the way she can and it's scuppered by just 'Moooooooo,'”he recalled, adding, “That cow was the biggest diva on this set.” According to UC Davis, cows are the mainagricultural sourceof greenhouse gasses. A single bovine burps 220 pounds of methane every year. However, cows themselves are still far from beingthe primary causeof anthropogenic climate change. A version of this story originally ran in 2015; it has been updated for 2021."

The animals—the largest fish in the ocean—can live as long as 130 years, according to a newstudyin the journalMarine and Freshwater Research. To give you an idea of how long that is, in 1888,Grover Clevelandwas finishing up his first presidential term, Thomas Edison had just started selling his first light bulbs, and the U.S. only had 38 states. To determine whale sharks' longevity, researchers from the Nova Southeastern University in Florida and the Maldives Whale Shark Research Program tracked male sharks around South Ari Atoll in the Maldives over the course of 10 years, calculating their sizes as they came back to the area over and over again. The scientists identified sharks that returned to the atoll every few years by their distinctive spot patterns, estimating their body lengths with lasers, tape, and visually to try to get the most accurate idea of their sizes. Using these measurements and data on whale shark growth patterns, the researchers were able to determine that male whale sharks tend to reach maturity around 25 years old and live until they’re about 130 years old. During those decades, they reach an average length of 61.7 feet—about as long as a bowling lane. While whale sharks areknown asgentle giants, they’redifficult to study, and scientists still don’t know a ton about them. They’re consideredendangered, making any information we can gather about them important. And this is the first time scientists have been able to accurately measure live, swimming whale sharks. “Up to now, such aging and growth research has required obtaining vertebrae from dead whale sharks and counting growth rings, analogous to counting tree rings, to determine age,” first author Cameron Perry said in apress statement. ”Our work shows that we can obtain age and growth information without relying on dead sharks captured in fisheries. That is a big deal.” Though whale sharks appear to be quite long-lived, their lifespan is short compared to the Greenland shark's—in 2016, researchersreportedthey may live for 400 years."

But this response to the problem only ends up contributing to it: Electricity, which most AC units run on, is produced by burning fossil fuels, which releases CO2 into the atmosphere and traps heat on Earth, making summers even more unbearable. At the rate things are developing, air conditioners could use as much electricityby 2050as all of China does today. If electric AC is your only option, you should definitely take advantage of it: Living without air conditioning not only makes your brainwork slower, but it can also belife-threateningin places where temperatures reach dangerous levels. For people who can afford to explore alternative ways to beat the heat, Columbia University'sEarth Institutehas some eco-friendly suggestions. A good place to start is by switching up your lifestyle. Loose, light-colored clothing made from natural fabrics like cotton won't overheat your body the way heavy, synthetic garments will. The same goes for your bed clothes: Choose sheets made from cotton, linen, percale, or bamboo. And because heat rises, the lower to the ground your bed is, the cooler you'll be at night. When it comes to mealtimes, stick to light, cold foods like salads and avoid using your kitchen's oven or stove when possible. Though it may seem unpleasant on a hot day, eating something spicy is a quick way to cool down because it kick-starts your sweat glands. For a cooler house with a smaller carbon footprint, take advantage of what you already have at your disposal. Close your curtains during the day to keep out heat, and open the windows on cool nights and early mornings. Switch your ceiling fan to turncounterclockwiseso it pushes cool air down instead of sucking it up, and if you have a box fan, place it so it points out the window so it draws heat out of the room. Other heat-beating features that require little to no energy include awnings, reflective window coverings, and deciduous trees.

A map of the U.S. showing the warmest day of the year by location was created using climate data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.

Looking at the different colors represented on the map, it’s clear that the hottest day of the year varies greatly—from the beginning of June to the end of October—depending on the region. Texas is an especially unique case because its hottest day varies from June 1 to September 1. One region bordering the Mexican state of Chihuahua tends to see its hottest day pretty early on, in the first half of June, while another region near Corpus Christi tends to heat up at the tail end of August. That’s also the case for parts of coastal California, Hawaii, and Louisiana.

For their research, scientists from Iowa State University and Cornell University looked at air pollution data collected over 24 years from 33 national parks and the 20 most populous metro areas in the U.S. Their results show that average ozone concentrations were ""statistically indistinguishable"" between the two groups from 1990 to 2014. On their own, the statistics look grim for America's protected areas, but they're actually a sign that environmental protection measures are working.

But as theBBC reports, one climate researcher was stumped when she discovered that many trees in the Norwegian village of Kåfjord were missing their rings. Extreme weather and invasive insects can cause some degree of damage to trees, but not enough to render them ringless. Claudia Hartl, from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany, knew that these trees dated back to 1945, but that alone wasn't enough information. Two other clues that helped Hartl and her colleagues solve the mystery were location and history. During World War II, Nazi soldiers moored theTirpitz—the largest battleship of Hitler's navy—off thewaters of Kåfjordto intercept vessels carrying Allied supplies to the Soviet Union. The Germans released an artificial smoke containing chlorosulphuric acid to conceal the ship's location, and this is believed to be the root of the trees' problem. Artificial smoke could have damaged the needles of the trees, halting the photosynthesis process and stunting the trees' growth, researchers found. It takes time for the trees to recover, but it is possible. One tree saw no growth at all from 1945 to 1954, but after 30 years its growth had returned to normal. Hartl presented the findings at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in Vienna this week [PDF].

In Olympic National Park in Washington, the first leaves are now appearing 23 days earlier than they did a century ago, while the Grand Canyon is seeing leaves appear about 11 days earlier. National parks in the Sierras and in Utah are seeing leaves appear five to 10 days earlier, as are areas along the Appalachian Trail. Some parks, however, particularly in the South, are actually seeing a later arrival of spring leaves, shown in dark gray in the graphic. The places that are witnessing earlier first blooms aren't always the ones with extra-early first leaves. The Appalachian Trail is blooming earlier, even though the first leaves aren't arriving any earlier. But in other places, like Olympic National Park, both the first leaves and the first blooms are arriving far earlier than they used to. “Changes in leaf and flowering dates have broad ramifications for nature,” National Park Service ecologist John Gross explained in the Earth Observatory’s blog. “Pollinators, migratory birds, hibernating species, elk, and caribou all rely on food sources that need to be available at the right time.” When temperatures get out of sync with usual seasonal changes, those species suffer.

AsResourcereports, single-use coffee containers are officially banned from Scotland's main government buildings. Instead of handing out hot drinks in disposable to-go cups, the cafes in Scottish parliament offices will now serve coffee in reusable ceramic mugs. Government officials will also have the option to bring their own travel mugs from home. The Scottish government says it won't take long for the new rule to make a difference. Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said in a statement, ""By removing single-use coffee cups from our main buildings, we will prevent 450,000 cups from being thrown away every year. That's enough cups to cover the distance between Edinburgh and Dundee."" The change comes after the European Unionannounced plansto phase out the single-use plastic products most likely to show up on beaches. The EU cited plastic food containers and drink cups as some of the worst offenders, and called on member states to give consumers the option to use alternative products like reusable cups, or to charge them extra for choosing disposable. While monitoring the success of the coffee cup ban, the Scottish government will be looking into getting rid of even more single-use materials by the end of the year. [h/tResource]"

Since then, April 22 has been a day to reflect on our impact on the environment, on broad and individual scales. So just how much has the Earth changed since the first Earth Day? According tothis videofrom the American Museum of Natural History, it's changed a lot, and not for the better. The world's population has doubled since 1970, from3.7 billionthen to over 7 billion today. While there are more people consuming resources, more resources are also being consumed per person. On average, we're each burning 37 percent more fossil fuel than we were in 1970, eating 60 percent more meat, and taking 495 percent more plane trips. All that consumption adds up to 1.2 trillion tons of CO2 emitted in the past five decades, which contributed to ocean waters warming 1°F and sea levels rising more than 5 inches. Those numbers look pretty grim, but it isn't all bad news: Humans have also made significant strides toward protecting the environment in that same period, including passing the Endangered Species Act, designating protected marine areas, and signing international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the globe. People are also more aware of what can be done on a personal level to reduce their carbon footprint. For tips on how to be greener this Earth Day, check out our list ofeco-friendly habits.

367,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/542526/surprising-role-bats-play-making-your-margarita,,"The next time you have a margarita, raise your glass to the humble bat. Long-nosed bats are the main pollinators of agave, the plant used to make both tequila and mezcal. (Tequila is specifically made from blue agave, orAgave tequilana, while mezcal can be made from any species of the plant.) These agave plants open their flowers at night, attracting bats with their sugary nectar, and in turn, the bats help spread their pollen. One of those bats, the lesser long-nosed bat, just got off the endangered species list inApril 2018, asThe Washington Postreported. It's the first bat species ever to recover its population enough to be taken off the Endangered Species List. Its revival is due, in part, to tequila producers along the bat's migration route between Mexico and the southwestern U.S. making their growing methods a little more bat-friendly. While the relationship between bats and agave might be mutualistic, the one between bats and booze isn't necessarily so. Typical agave production for tequila and mezcal involves harvesting the plant right before it reaches sexual maturity—the flowering stage—because that's when its sugar content peaks, and because after the plant flowers, it dies. Instead of letting the plants reproduce naturally through pollination, farmers plant the clones that grow at the agave plant's base, known ashijuelos. That means fields of agave get razed before bats get the chance to feed off those plants. This method is bad for bats, but it's not great for agave, either; over time, it leads to inbred plants that have lower genetic diversity than their cross-pollinated cousins, ones that require more andmore pesticidesto keep them healthy. Rodrigo Medellín, an ecologist who has been nicknamed the ""Bat Man of Mexico,"" has been leading the crusade for bat-friendly tequila for decades, trying to convince tequila producers to let some of just 5 percent of their plants flower. The Tequila Interchange Project—a nonprofit organization made up of tequila producers, scientists, and tequila enthusiasts—led to the release of three bat-friendly agave liquors in the U.S.in 2016: two tequilas, Siembra Valles Ancestral and Tequila Ocho, and a mezcal, Don Mateo de la Sierra. In 2017, when Medellín and his team visited the agave fields of Don Mateo de la Sierra to gather data, theydiscoveredthat the project was even more bat-friendly than they thought. The Mexican long-nosed bat, another endangered species, was also taking its meals at the field's flowering plants. This weekend, raise a glass of tequila to all the bats out there—just make sure it's a bat-friendly brand."
368,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/544978/projects-reenvision-traditional-cemetery,,"Globally, nearly57 millionpeople died in 2016. If you happen to be a cemetery caretaker, you might be wondering where we managed to put them all. Indeed, many cemeteries in the world’s major cities are filling up fast, with no choice left but to tear up walkways, trees, and green spaces just to make room for more graves. In response to these concerns, a variety of visionaries have attempted to reimagine the modern cemetery. These plans tend to fall into one of two camps: Biologists and environmentalists have brainstormed alternate methods for disposing of bodies, some of which are said to be better for the planet than the traditional methods of burial and cremation. Meanwhile, architects have looked at ways of adapting the burial space itself, whether that means altering a traditional cemetery or creating something new and more ephemeral. Here are just a few of the creative ideas that have emerged in recent years. As cemeteries started running out of ground to dig, it was only a matter of time before they started building up. There's been a lot of talk aboutskyscraper cemeteriesin recent years, although the idea dates back to at least 1829, when British architect Thomas Willsonproposeda 94-story mausoleum in London. ""The vertical cemetery, with its open front, will become a significant part of the city and a daily reminder of death’s existence,""saysMartin McSherry, whosedesignfor an open-air skyscraper cemetery with layers of park-like burial grounds was one of the proposals presented at the Oslo Conference for Nordic Cemeteries and Graveyards in 2013. Another recentplanby architecture students in Sweden suggested repurposing a cluster of silos into a vertical columbarium (a place to store urns). Brazil’s Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica was one of the first places to implement this vertical concept back in 1984, and at32 stories high, it currently holds the Guinness World Record for thetallest cemetery. For much of human history, graves were often reused, or common graves were dug deep enough to accommodate multiple bodies stacked one on top of the other. “Our current cemetery design is actually a pretty new thing,” Allison Meier, a New York City cemetery tour guide (andMental Flosswriter), tells us. “It wasn’t normal for everyone to get a headstone in the past and we didn’t have these big sprawling green spaces.” Now that many urban cemeteries are filling up, the idea of reusing plots is once again gaining popularity. In London, it’s estimated that onlyone-thirdof the city’s boroughs will have burial space by 2031. In response, the City of London Cemetery—one of the biggest cemeteries in Britain—has startedreusingcertain grave plots (the practice is legal in the city, even though grave reuse is outlawed elsewhere in England). Across continental Europe, however, it's not uncommon for graves to be ""rented"" rather than bought for all eternity. In countries like the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, and Greece, families can hold a plot for their loved one as long as they continue to pay a rental fee. If they stop paying, the grave may be reused, with the previous remains either buried deeper or relocated to a common grave. Meier says she isn’t aware of any cemeteries in New York City that have started reusing their plots, though. “That’s a tough thing for Americans to get on board with because it’s been a normal practice in a lot of places, but it’s never been normal here,” she says. Ninety percent of bodies in Hong Kong are cremated, according toCNN, and niches in the city's public columbaria are at a premium. The average wait for a space is aboutfour years, sparking concerns that Hong Kongers could be forced to move their loved ones' ashes across the border tomainland China, where more space is available. (A space at a private columbarium in Hong Kong can be prohibitively expensive, at a cost of about $128,000.) To address this issue, aproposalemerged in 2012 to convert a cruise ship into a floating columbarium dubbed the “Floating Eternity.” Designed by Hong Kong and London-based architecture firmBREAD Studio, the columbarium would be able to accommodate the ashes of 370,000 people. Although it's still just an idea, BREAD Studio designer Benny Lee tellsCNN, ""A floating cemetery is the next natural step in Hong Kong's history of graveyards."" Land may be limited, but the sea is vast—and several companies want to take the cemetery concept underwater. AtNeptune Memorial Reefoff the coast of Key Biscayne, Florida, human ashes are mixed with cement to create unique memorials in the shape of seashells and other objects of the client's choice. The memorials are then taken by divers to the ocean floor and incorporated into a human-made reef designed to look like the Lost City of Atlantis.Eternal Reefs, based out of Sarasota, Florida, offers a similar service. Not a water person? Try space instead.Elysium Space, a San Francisco-based company founded by a formersoftware engineerat NASA, offers a couple of “celestial services.” At a cost of nearly $2500, the Shooting Star Memorial “delivers a symbolic portion of your loved one’s remains to Earth’s orbit, only to end this celestial journey as a shooting star,” while the Lunar Memorial will deliver a ""symbolic portion"" of human remains to the surface of the moon for a fee of nearly $10,000. Another company,Celestis, offers similar services ranging in price from $1300 to $12,500. Critics of burial and cremation sayboth are badfor the environment. To address the need for a memorial method that doesn’t emit carbon dioxide, waste resources, or release carcinogenic embalming fluid into the soil, a number ofeco-friendly optionshave emerged. One such innovation is the “mushroom burial suit,"" a head-to-toe outfit that's lined with mushroom spores designed to devour human tissue and absorb the body's toxins. Another company,Recompose, espouses human composting—a process by which a corpse would be converted into a cubic yard of soil, which could then be used to nurture new life in a garden. The procedure isn’t legal yet, but the company plans to work with the Washington State legislature to make it available to the general public before eventually rolling it out nationwide. Many innovative proposals have emerged from theDeathLABat Columbia University, including aplanto convert human biomass (organic matter) into light. The design—a constellation of light that would serve as both a memorial and art installation—won a competition hosted byFuture Cemetery, a collaboration between the University of Bath’s Centre for Death & Society and media company Calling the Shots.John Troyer, director of the UK-based center, says they're working on raising funds to install a concept piece based on that design at Arnos Vale Cemetery in Bristol, England, but any usage of actual biomass would have to be cleared through the proper regulatory channels first. According to DeathLAB, the project would save significant space—within six years, it would more than double the capacity of the cemetery orchard where the memorials would be installed. As virtual reality technology gets more and more advanced, some question whether a physical cemetery is needed at all. The website iVeneration.com, founded by a Hong Kong entrepreneur, lets users ""create virtual headstones anywhere in an augmented reality landscape of Hong Kong, including such unlikely places as a downtown park,"" as Reutersdescribes it. In Japan, oneonline cemeteryallows the bereaved to “light” incense, share memories of their loved one in comments, and even grab a virtual glass of beer. Similarly, an app calledRiPCemeterycreated a social network where users can craft a virtual memorial and share photos of the deceased. However, Troyer says he doesn’t believe technology will ever usurp the need for physical spaces. “A lot of the companies talking about digital solutions talk about ‘forever’—and that’s very complicated with the internet, because the virtual material we create can easily disappear,"" he told theThe Guardian. ""The lowly gravestone has been a very successful human technology, and I suspect it will last … I would go with granite.”"

Lava from recent volcanic activity has reached the Pacific Ocean and is generating toxic, glass-laced ""laze,"" according to Honolulu-basedKITV. Just what is this dangerous substance? Molten lava has a temperature of about 2000°F, while the surrounding seawater in Hawaii is closer to 80°F. When this super-hot lava hits the colder ocean, the heat makes the water boil, creating powerful explosions of steam, scalding hot water, and projectile rock fragments known as tephra. These plumes are calledlava haze, or laze. Though it looks like regular steam, laze is much more dangerous. When the water and lavacombine, and hot lava vaporizes seawater, a series ofreactionscauses the formation of toxic gas. Chloride from the sea salt mixes with hydrogen in the steam to create a dense, corrosive mixture of hydrochloric acid. The vapor forms clouds that then turn into acid rain. That’s not the only danger. The lava cools down rapidly, forming volcanic glass—tiny shards of which explode into the air along with the gases. Even the slightest encounter with a wisp of laze can be problematic. The hot, acidic mixture can irritate the skin, eyes, and respiratory system. It's particularly hazardous to those with breathing problems, like people with asthma. In 2000, two peoplediedin Hawaii Volcanoes National Park from inhaling laze coming from an active lava flow. The problem spreads far beyond where the lava itself is flowing, pushing the problem downwind. Due to the amount of lava flowing into the ocean and the strength of the winds, laze currently being generated by the Kilauea eruptions could spread up to 15 miles away, a USGS geologist toldReuters.

According toPopular Science, scientists have found invasive Cuban treefrogs at a New Orleans zoo, marking the first toehold the amphibians have been able to make in the U.S. outside of Florida. Cuban treefrogsare native to Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and the Bahamas, but they came to the U.S. in the 1920s by way of the Florida Keys. They have since spread as far north as Jacksonville. The massive frogs—females can grow up to 6 inches long—are major pests, hunting several species of native Floridian frogs and out-competing others, clogging drains and setting up camp in toilets, and occasionally causing power outages when they decide to hide in utility boxes. Now, the species is showing up in New Orleans, more than 430 miles away. They may have stowed away on a 2016 shipment of palm trees from Lake Placid, Florida bound for the elephant exhibit at New Orleans's Audubon Zoo. A U.S. Geological Survey in the fall of 2017 captured hundreds of the frogs on and around the zoo's grounds. Over the course of four surveys, USGS scientists found 367 frogs and 2000 Cuban treefrog tadpoles. They drained the two pools where the tadpoles were swimming in the hopes of killing off any they missed, but the likelihood of reversing the spread of the frogs is low. The USGS warned in a recentpress statementthat ""eradicating the recently discovered population in Louisiana is improbable."" The frogs reproduce quickly and will eat almost anything. Based on the results of these surveys, it seems they have already driven out all the native frogs in Riverview, the section of Audubon Park where the tadpoles were found. Brad Glorioso, the lead USGS ecologist on thestudy, explained that while stowaway treefrogs have trouble surviving when they make their way to higher latitudes, the climate around New Orleans seems to be more hospitable to them. ""They often end up in places with unsuitable climates, but in south Louisiana, Cuban treefrogs appear capable of withstanding seasonal cold spells by seeking appropriate refuge,"" he said. For now, the best scientists can hope for is keeping the frogs from moving across the river from the zoo into one of the large public nature preserves nearby. [h/tPopular Science]"

Black plastic isn't widely recycled because its dark pigment makes it hard for many plastic sorting facilities to detect it via infrared radiation. Nevertheless, the plastic parts of old electronic devices like laptops and music players are often repurposed into common household items. Researchers used X-ray fluorescence spectrometers to examine 600 black plastic items and found the presence of additives that can be harmful to human health, such as bromine, antimony, and lead. Historically, bromine has been used in electronic devices to prevent them from catching fire, but they’re not suitable for food containers or other items (like children's toys) that can come into contact with one's mouth. Their findings were published inEnvironment International.

375,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/94645/founder-earth-day-looks-back-how-it-began,,"On the very first Earth Day in 1970,Denis Hayesstood on a stage in Central Park, stunned by the number of people who'd come to honor the planet. Now in his 70s, Hayes remembers it was like looking at the ocean—“you couldn’t see where the sea of people ended.” Crowd estimates reached more than a million people. For Hayes, who is now board chair of the internationalEarth Day Network, it was the culmination of a year’s worth of work. As an urban ecology graduate student at Harvard University, he’d volunteered to help organize a small initiative by Wisconsin senatorGaylord Nelson. Nelson was horrified by the1969 oil spillin Santa Barbara, California, and wanted to raise awareness about environmental issues by holding teaching events similar to those being held by civil rights and anti-war activists. Senator Nelson saw a growing disconnect between the concept of progress and the idea of American well-being, Hayes tells Mental Floss. “There was a sense that America was prosperous and getting better, but at the same time, the air in the country was similar to the air today in China, Mexico City, or New Delhi,"" Hayes says. ""Rivers were catching on fire. Lakes were unswimmable.” Nelson's plan for these environmental teach-ins was for speakers to educate college students about environmental issues. But he had no one to organize them. So Hayes, Nelson’s sole volunteer, took control on a national level, organizing teach-ins at Harvard first and then across the U.S. Initially, the response was tepid at best. “Rather rapidly it became clear that this wasn’t a hot issue at colleges and universities in 1969,” Hayes says. “We had a war raging, and civil rights were getting very emotional after the Nixon election.” Still, both Hayes and Nelson noticed an influx of mail to the senator's office from women with young families worried about the environment. So instead of focusing on colleges, the two decided to take a different tactic, creating events with community-based organizations across the country, Hayes says. They also decided that rather than a series of teach-ins, they'd hold a single, nationwide teach-in on the same day. They called it Earth Day, and set a date: April 22. Hayes now had a team of young adults working for the cause, and he himself had dropped out of school to tackle it full time. Long before social media, the project began to spread virally. “It just resonated,” he says. Women and smaller environmental-advocacy groups really hooked onto the idea, and word spread by mouth and by information passing between members of the groups. Courtesy of Denis Hayes With the cooperation and participation of grassroots groups and volunteers across the country, and a few lawmakers who supported the initiative, Hayes’ efforts culminated in the event on April 22, 1970. Hayes started the day in Washington, D.C., where he and the staff were based. There was a rally and protest on the National Mall, though by that point Hayes had flown to New York, where Mayor John Lindsay provided a stage in Central Park. Parts of Fifth Avenue were shut down for the events, which included Earth-oriented celebrations, protests, and speeches by celebrities. Some of those attending the event even attacked nearby cars for causing pollution. After the rally, Hayes flew to Chicago for a smaller event. “We had a sense that it was going to be big, but when the day actually dawned, the crowds were so much bigger than anyone had experienced before,” Hayes said. The event drew grassroots activists working on a variety of issues—Agent Orange, lead paint in poor urban neighborhoods, saving the whales—and fostered a sense of unity among them. “There were people worrying about these [environmental] issues before Earth Day, but they didn’t think they had anything in common with one another,"" Hayes says. ""We took all those individual strands and wove them together into the fabric of modern environmentalism.” Hayes and his team spent the summer getting tear-gassed at protests against the American invasion of Cambodia, which President Nixon authorized just six days after Earth Day. But by fall, the team refocused on environmental issues—and elections. They targeted a “dirty dozen” members of Congress up for re-election who had terrible environmental records, and campaigned for candidates who championed environmental causes to run against them. They defeated seven out of 12. “It was a very poorly funded but high-energy campaign,” Hayes says. “That sent the message to Congress that it wasn’t just a bunch of people out frolicking in the sunshine planting daisies and picking up litter. This actually had political chops.” The early '70s became a golden age for environmental issues; momentum from the Earth Day movement spawned the creation of theClean Air Act, theClean Water Act, theSafe Drinking Water Act, theEndangered Species Act, theMarine Mammal Protection Act, theEnvironmental Education Act(which was initially passed in 1970 and revived in 1990), and theEnvironmental Protection Agency. “We completely changed the framework within which America does business, more than any other period in history with the possible exception of the New Deal,” Hayes says. “But our little revolution was brought entirely from the grassroots up.” In 1990, Hayes was at it again. He organized the first international Earth Day, with about 200 million participants across more than 140 countries. Since then it’s become a global phenomenon. Despite its popularity, though, we still have a long way to go, even if the improvements Hayes fought for have made these issues feel more remote. Hayes noted that everything they were fighting in the '70s was something tangible—something you could see, taste, smell, or touch. Climate change can seem much less real—and harder to combat—to the average person who isn’t yet faced with its effects.

The gym also recently debuted an ECO-POWR treadmill that can harvest energy generated during a run. A single bike can generate as much as 200 watts per hour, and one spin class produces enough energy to power two fridges for 24 hours. The gym's battery can also be used to power lights and charge cellphones and laptops. The results are apparent in the gym's energy bill—after debuting the new equipment, its electricity costs dropped from $680 to $30 a month.

The organism, namedIdeonella sakaiensis, can break down a thumbnail-sized flake of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the type of plastic used for beverage bottles, in just six weeks. Now,The Guardianreports that an international team of scientists has engineered a mutant version of the plastic-munching bacteria that's 20 percent more efficient. Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the University of Portsmouth in the UK didn't originally set out to produce a super-powered version of the bacteria. Rather, they just wanted a better understanding of how it evolved. PET started appearing in landfills only within the last 80 years, which means thatI. sakaiensismust have evolved very recently. The microbe uses an enzyme called PETase to break down the plastic it consumes. The structure of the enzyme is similar to the one used by some bacteria to digest cutin, a natural protective coating that grows on plants. As the scientists write in theirstudypublished in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they hoped to get a clearer picture of how the new mechanism evolved by tweaking the enzyme in the lab. What they got instead was a mutant enzyme that degrades plastic even faster than the naturally occurring one. The improvement isn't especially dramatic—the enzyme still takes a few days to start the digestion process—but it shows thatI. sakaiensisholds even more potential than previously expected. ""What we've learned is that PETase is not yet fully optimized to degrade PET—and now that we've shown this, it's time to apply the tools of protein engineering and evolution to continue to improve it,"" study coauthor Gregg Beckham said in apress statement. The planet's plastic problem is only growing worse. According toa studypublished in 2017, humans have produced a total of 9 billion tons of plastic in less than a century. Of that number, only 9 percent of it is recycled, 12 percent is incinerated, and 79 percent is sent to landfills. By 2050, scientists predict that we'll have created 13 billion tons of plastic waste. When left alone, PET takes centuries to break down, but the plastic-eating microbes could be the key to ridding it from the environment in a quick and safe way. The researchers believe that PETase could be turned into super-fast enzymes that thrives in extreme temperatures where plastic softens and become easier to break down. They've already filed a patent for the first mutant version of the enzyme. [h/tThe Guardian]"

The giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) contains a corrosive sap that causes severe rashes, third-degree burns, and even permanent blindness if you get the photosensitive chemicals on your skin or in your eyes,Science Alertreports. The noxious, invasive weed was just identified in Clarke County, Virginia, near the Massey Herbarium at Virginia Tech. That brings the number of states it's beenspottedin to 11, including Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Maine. Beyond the U.S., it has taken root all over the world, from the UK to Iceland to Australia. Similar to the common but slightly less dangerouscow parsnip, giant hogweed is native to Central Asia and was firstbrought to North Americain the early 1990s as an ornamental plant, its unique shape making it popular among gardeners. But it soon became invasive: Once it’s established in an area, it can take up to five years to eradicate a colony. Now the plant is considered a public health concern. Hogweed can cause a reaction known asphytophotodermatitiswhen it comes into contact with skin that is subsequently exposed to UV rays—but the effects of hogweed are much more severe. A painful blister can develop within hours and last for months; the exposed skin can remain sensitive to sunlight for years even after the blisters heal. Hogweed can be difficult to distinguish from the cow parsnip, and the plant is often misidentified. First, check for height: Hogweeds are typically taller than 8 feet, while cow parsnip tends to be 5 to 8 feet tall.

On top of the safety concerns, the cost of running a Jurassic Park would raise its own set of pretty pricey issues. Energy supplierE.ONrecently collaborated with physicists from Imperial College London to calculate how much energy the fictional attraction would eat up in the real world. The infographic below borrows elements that appear in both theJurassic ParkandJurassic Worldfilms. One of the most costly features in the park would be the aquarium for holding the massive marine reptiles. To keep the water heated and hospitable year-round, the park would need to pay an energy bill of close to $3 million a year. Maintaining a pterosaur aviary would be an even more expensive endeavor. To come up with this cost, the researchers looked at the yearly amount of energy consumed by theEden Project, a massive biome complex in the UK. Using that data, they concluded that a structure built to holdwinged creaturesbigger than any bird alive today would add up to $6.6 million a year in energy costs. Other facilities they envisioned for the island include an egg incubator, embryo fridge, hotel, and emergency bunker. And of course, there would be electric fences running 24/7 to keep the genetic attractions separated from park guests. In total, the physicists estimated that the park would use 455 million kilowatt hours a year, or the equivalent of 30,000 average homes. That annual energy bill comes out to roughly $63 million. Keep in mind that energy would still only make up one part of Jurassic Park's hypothetical budget—factoring in money for lawsuits would be a whole different story."

Not only does it look like real leather, but it feels like it too, according to the California-based company. For the past nine years, Bolt Threads has been using biotechnology to take materials found in nature and transform them into never-before-seen textiles. As the company prefers to put it: “Animal leather is so 1st century.” Bolt Threads partnered with biomaterials company Ecovative to license the technology. Mycelium cells are grown in a lab, and different variables like temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels are controlled to create a large fibrous network that looks a lot like leather,Fast Companyreports. “We cut it into slices, and it goes through a process not dissimilar to how animal hides are tanned to become leather, except it’s more environmentally friendly,” Dan Widmaier, founder and CEO of Bolt Threads, explained. By tweaking the growth process, they can change the strength, durability, and suppleness of the leather. While mushroom leather might not sound like the most luxurious material, the company has found an unlikely ally in the fashion industry. English designer Stella McCartney, daughter of Paul McCartney, crafted a handbag out of Mylo that has been dubbed theFalabella Prototype One. It’s currently on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which is also showcasing bags that McCartney created for Paris Fashion Week using Microsilk, Bolt Threads’s imitation spider silk material. In an effort to reduce the consumption of real silk, which typically involves the killing of silkworms, McCartney even created a spider silk dress. Mylo's introduction comes at a time when many haute couture labels are looking to market their products as sustainable. Gucci has been fur-free since last year and it also launched a line ofsunglassesmade from a biodegradable material.

Study co-authorTim Shank, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, spotted theoctopusin 2005. During a researchexpeditionin the North Atlantic, one of the remotely operated vehicles he was working with collected several coral branches with something strange attached to them.

In the case of the video below, the camera accidentally slid down the side of the minke whale's body, providing an unexpected look at the way its throat moves as it feeds. Minke whales are one of thesmallestbaleen whales, but they're still pretty substantial animals, growing 30 to 35 feet long and weighing up to 20,000 pounds.

As our landscape shifts (literally), our earthquake-detecting technology must evolve to keep up with it. Now, a team of researchers is changing the game with a new system that uses AI to identify seismic activity,Futurismreports. The team, led by deep learning researcher Thibaut Perol, published the study detailing their new neural network in the journalScience Advances. Dubbed ConvNetQuake, it uses an algorithm to analyze the measurements of ground movements, a.k.a. seismograms, and determines which are small earthquakes and which are just noise.Seismic noisedescribes the vibrations that are almost constantly running through the ground, either due to wind, traffic, or other activity at surface level. It's sometimes hard to tell the difference between noise and legitimate quakes, which is why most detection methods focus on medium and large earthquakes instead of smaller ones. But better understanding natural and manmade earthquakes means studying them at every level. With ConvNetQuake, that could soon become a reality. After testing the system in Oklahoma, the team reports it detected 17 times more earthquakes than what was recorded by the Oklahoma Geological Survey earthquake catalog. That level of performance is more than just good news for seismologists studying quakes caused by humans.

That's right: not carbon neutral, carbonnegative. In anarticleon the subject, the Climate Council—an independent, Australia-based nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public on matters related to climate change—defines carbon negative status as occurring when a country's carbon emissions are not only offset, but are actually in the negative due to the generation and exportation of renewable energy. There are several reasons for this impressive feat. Bhutan—a small, landlocked country in the middle of the Himalayas—has apopulationof approximately 813,000 and produces 2.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. The country is 72 percent forest, and those forests trap more than three times their carbon dioxide output through a process calledcarbon sequestration, the long-term storage of carbon in plants, soil, and the ocean. This means that Bhutan is acarbon sink: It absorbs more carbon than it releases as carbon dioxide. Specifically, Bhutan is a carbon sink for more than 4 million tons of CO2 each year. In addition, the country exports most of the renewable electricity generated by its rivers, which is equivalent to 6 million tons of CO2. Bhutan is also exceptionally environmentally friendly. This is partly because it takes a holistic view of development, measuring it with the Gross National Happiness Index instead of the Gross Domestic Product Index, like most countries. Instead of only prioritizing economic improvement, Gross National Happiness balances it with sociocultural and environmental improvement. The eco-conscious country invests in sustainable transport, subsidizeselectric vehicles, and has an entirely paperless government.

(If the tube gets dislodged, an auto-closing mechanism ensures that bees don’t invade your home.) The companystrongly recommendsthat the units be mounted on wall studs to accommodate the weight of the bees and their honey. The BEEcosystem also has a sliding feed panel so that you can nourish your new colony with water and table sugar, as well as a light-filtering cover so the bees aren’t disturbed by artificial light sources in the evening. The units can also be chain-linked to accommodate growing populations You might be wondering if—angry bees in your kitchen aside—this is actually a good idea. When the BEEcosystem was beginning to get press during its developmental stages in 2015, some beekeepersvoiced concernsabout whether the consistently warm temperatures of indoor living might influence a bee’s life cycle, or if they might be more prone to disease. Since there's not yet a surplus of people with bee displays mounted on their dining room walls, no one's quite sure yet, but you can see how the system works in the video below. You can preorder the hives, which are expected to ship later this year, for$599each. Installation_sourcefromMikeonVimeo. [h/tBusiness Insider]"

To use the system, customers walk up and weigh their empty container at a self-serve station, printing and attaching a label with itstare weight. Then, they can fill it with flour, nuts, or other kinds of dry goods, weigh it again, and print the price tag before taking it up to the check out. (Regular customers only have to weigh their containers once, since they can save the peel-off label to use again next time.) Planet Organic is offering cereals, legumes, grains, nuts, chocolate, dried fruit, and even some cleaning products in bulk as part of this program, significantly reducing the amount of waste shoppers would otherwise be taking home on each grocery trip. Zero-waste grocery stores have been popping up in Europe for severalyears. These shops, like Berlin's Original Unverpackt, don't offer any bags or containers, asking customers bring their own instead. This strategy also encourages people to buy only what they need, which eliminates food waste—there's no need to buy a full 5-pound bag of flour if you only want to make one cake.

Raising enoughmethane-farting, resource-intensive cows to satisfy our cravings for burgers and steaks produces an outsizedcarbon footprintthat plays a significant role inclimate change. But what about your breakfast egg-and-cheese? A newstudysays you should feel guilty about that, too. Recent findings reported in the journalSustainable Production and Consumptionexamine the carbon footprint of 40 different kinds of sandwiches—from the simple ham and cheese to tuna, BLTs, and breakfast sandwiches—both homemade and pre-packaged. Researchers from the University of Manchester calculated the carbon necessary to produce standard recipes, including the agriculture required for the ingredients, the manufacturing of the packaging materials, the refrigeration required to keep the sandwiches cold, and the waste generated. They sourced their estimates from previous studies on the carbon footprint of producing and transporting ingredients like bread, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and canned tuna as well as the energy cost of manufacturing packaging, transporting materials, and taking waste to the landfill. They found that of all the sandwiches, those that combined pork (or prawns, because prawn and mayonnaise sandwiches are apparently apopularthing) and cheese are the most carbon-intensive. A bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich clocked in as the most environmentally taxing sandwich of them all, with a carbon footprint of 1441 grams CO2 equivalent—a measurement of the global warming potential—per sandwich. (The diet of the average meat-eater in the UK produces about 7200 grams CO2 equivalent daily. For comparison, if you drive your car four miles, it emits about 1650 grams CO2,roughly.) Chicken and tuna sandwiches were slightly less carbon-intensive, but vegetarian sandwiches didn't fare as well as you might think—depending on how much and what type of cheese was involved, they could have carbon footprints as high as some of the meat sandwiches. The researchers suggest that some improvements to the way sandwiches are produced and sold might decrease their carbon footprint by as much as 50 percent. Reducing the amount of meat, eggs, and cheese used, excluding tomato, lettuce, or mayo, reducing packaging, and other changes could all contribute to shrinking a sandwich's carbon footprint. Unfortunately, here's a limit to how much a sandwich's environmental impact can be reduced. You can't really have a BLT without the B, L, or T. But if you're making it instead of buying it, you're saving a lot of emissions. As you might expect given the environmental cost of packaging, ready-made commercial sandwiches had a much bigger carbon footprint than their homemade counterparts containing the same ingredients—2.2 times larger, in fact. Just another reason to feel guilty about not bringing your own lunch from home."
396,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/534827/technologies-that-are-revolutionizing-ocean-exploration,,"The Earth is an ocean planet—more than 70 percent of the surface is covered by seawater. But despite being such an essential part of life, the deepest parts of the world's oceans are still largely unexplored. According to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, merely 10 to 15 percent of the seafloor has been mapped with accuracy, which means we know less about the seafloor than the surface ofMars. But the state of sea exploration is changing fast. The dark, high-pressure conditions of the ocean depths that once made research there impossible are now being explored with cutting-edge technology. That new tech and the discoveries to come from it are the focus of a new exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History calledUnseen Oceans. As museum curator John Sparks said at a press preview, the goal of the exhibition is to show visitors ""how little we know, and to tell them how much we're learning so rapidly with technology."" Here are some of the technologies featured in the exhibition, which opens March 12. One of the biggest recent discoveries made in the field of deep ocean exploration is the proliferation of biofluorescence in the darkest parts of the sea. Realms that look pitch black to human eyes are actually filled with more than 250 species of fish glowing in red, orange, and green hues. One of these species is the catshark, which fluoresces green in the dim blue light that reaches the sea floor. To detect this effect, researchers builta camerathat filters out certain wavelengths of light like the shark's eye does. (This is how the sharks see each other in the darkness.) Combined with artificial blue light to enhance the fluorescent color, this equipment allows scientists to record the light show. Listening to whales vocalize tells us a lot about the way they live and interact, but this is difficult to do when a species spends most of its time in the deep ocean. In order to eavesdrop on beaked whales, scientists needed to fit sophisticated acoustic equipment into a submersible built to explore high-pressure environments. Enter the Deep Ocean REMUS Echosounder, orDOR-E. (REMUS stands for ""Remote Environmental Monitoring UnitS."") Developed by marine scientist Kelly Benoit-Bird and her team at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the autonomous underwater vehicle can reach depths up to 1970 feet and has enough battery life to record a day's worth of deep-sea audio. The device was named forFindingNemo's Dory because it ""speaks whale,"" according toUnseen Oceans. Collecting specimens at the bottom of the ocean isn't as simple as collecting them on land; researchers can't just step out of their submersible to pick up a mollusk from the seabed. The only way to retrieve a sample at such depths is with a machine. When these machines are designed to be bulky and rigid to withstand the intense water pressure around them, they can end up crushing the specimen before scientists have the chance to study it. So-called soft grippers are a clever alternative. Memory foam evenly distributes the force around the creature being handled, and Kevlar lace keeps the fingers from spreading when they inflate with water. Even with its squishy construction, the mechanism is sturdy enough to work at depths reaching 1000 feet. A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) can explore the tight, crushing pockets of the ocean that human divers can't reach. This technology is often costly and limited to research teams with big budgets. A new company calledOpenROVaims to make underwater drones more accessible to everyday explorers. Their signature ROV, Trident, starts at just $1500. Sometimes the easiest way for scientists to get a view of the bottom of the ocean is by sending equipment to space. Satellites in orbit can estimate measurements of the peaks and valleys shaping the seabed by beaming radar pulses towards Earth and calculating the time it takes for them to bounce back. While this method doesn't provide a terribly accurate map of the ocean floor, it can be used to gauge depths in even the most remote areas. Autonomous undersea robots come in all shapes and sizes. Mini-autonomous underwater explorers, orm-AUEs, developed by Scripps oceanographer Jules Jaffe are meant to be deployed in large groups or ""swarms."" The grapefruit-sized devices act like plankton, bobbing at a constant depth in the ocean and measuring factors like water temperature. By studying the underwater explorers, scientists hope to better understand how plankton, major contributors of the Earth's oxygen, thrive and travel through the sea. This technology is so new, it hasn't hit the water yet. Once it's ocean-ready, researchers plan to attach the miniature suction cups to the bells of jellies. The device automatically measures a jelly's movements and ocean chemistry as the animal swims around. Eventually the jelly regenerates the top layer of its bell, shedding the tag and moving on unharmed. Once detached, the tag floats to the water's surface where it alerts scientists to its location via a VHF antenna and green reflective tape."

According to a study from the transportation consulting firmINRIX, all that time stuck in traffic can cost the world’s major cities tens of billions of dollars each year. The study, the largest to examine vehicle traffic on a global scale, measured congestion in 1360 cities across 38 countries. Los Angeles ranked number one internationally with drivers spending an average of 102 hours in traffic jams during peak times in a year. Moscow and New York City were close behind, both with 91 lost hours, followed by Sao Paulo in Brazil with 86 and San Francisco with 79. INRIX also calculated the total cost to the cities based on their congestion numbers. While Los Angeles loses a whopping $19.2 billion a year to time wasted on the road, New York City takes the biggest hit. Traffic accounts for $33.7 billion lost by the city annually, or an average of $2982 per driver. The cost is $10.6 billion a year for San Francisco and $7.1 billion for Atlanta. Those figures are based on factors like the loss of productivity from workers stuck in their cars, higher road transportation costs, and the fuel burned by vehicles going nowhere. Congestion on the highway can be caused by something as dramatic as a car crash or as minor as a nervous driver tapping their brakes too often.Driverless carscould eventually fix this problem, but until then, the fastest solution may be to discourage people from getting behind the wheel in the first place.

398,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/533747/poop-visible-space-helped-scientists-find-remote-supercolony-penguins,,"Penguin poop visible from space just helped scientists discover a previously unknown, massive colony of Adélie penguins on a chain of remote Antarctic islands, according to a new study published inScientific Reports. In 2014, Stony Brook University's Heather Lynch and NASA's Mathew Schwaller identified guano stains in satellite images of the Danger Islands, a rocky archipelago off the Antarctic Peninsula. The visible guano marks signaled that a large population of penguins was living there. When the scientists launched an expedition to the islands to learn more, and counted birds by hand and with a camera-equipped drone, they discovered a ""supercolony"" of more than 1.5 million Adélies. ""Until recently, the Danger Islands weren't known to be an important penguin habitat,"" Lynch said in apress release. By this count, the islands are actually home to the largest population of the species on the Antarctic Peninsula. The Danger Islands were discovered by British explorerJames Clark Rossin 1842, and got their name from the fact that they are often hidden under ice. Ross and his crew almost crashedtheir shipson them—""appearing among heavy fragments of ice, they were almost completely concealed until the ship was nearly upon them,"" as the USGS's Geographic Names Information Systemexplains. They're still hard to access and dangerous to visit because of the thick ice that surrounds them. And that makes them perfect for penguins. Penguins depend on sea ice for survival, and in places where sea ice is disappearing, their populations are declining. The western Antarctic Peninsula has seen huge declines in Adélie penguin populations as the ice has melted—up to 80 percent in some colonies since 1981, byone estimate. But because of the geographic variation in how climate change has affected temperatures, the population decline hasn't been the same everywhere, and other colonies have even grown. This new discovery tracks with Lynch's previousresearch, which has found that the impact of climate change on Antarctic penguins will be highly variable depending on the location. “Just because a huge colony was just found doesn't mean that colonies in areas where sea ice isn't great aren't declining,"" University of Minnesota ecologistMichelle LaRuewrote in an email to Mental Floss. “If the sea ice conditions at the Danger Islands colony all of a sudden saw similar trends in sea ice decline, I would still expect that colony to decline, too."" LaRue has worked with Lynch to study penguin populationsbefore, but wasn't involved with this latest study. The paper also shows how useful the combination of satellite, ground observation, and drones can be in counting penguins in remote areas. The drone was able to capture images like the one above every second as it flew over the island, creating 2D and 3D views of the whole area. This made their overall population count more accurate, which will aid researchers in tracking changes in the colony as time goes on."

InNovember 2017, the nation moved to restrict a class of pesticide that’s deadly to bees, and now 15 farms across the country are testing a natural supplement to the chemicals. AsThe Guardianreports, colorful strips of wildflowers have been planted among crops as a way to combat pests. The floral stripes add vibrant pops of color to the farmland, but they’re not there for show. By planting wildflowers in the fields, farmers hope to attract predatory insects like hoverflies, parasitic wasps, and ground beetles. These are exactly the type of bugs farmers want flocking to their property: They don’t eat crops and instead prey on the insects that do. With more natural predators to control pest populations, farmers may be able to reduce their use of harmful pesticides. The wildflower strategy isn’t entirely new. Farmers already knew that planting borders of wildflowers around their fields is an effective way to lure in good insects, but this method still leaves the center of their farms vulnerable. By dispersing flowers throughout the area, they can broaden the predatory insects’ range. The 15 farms planted with wildflowers last fall are part of a trial run put together by theCenter for Ecology and Hydrology. The organization will monitor the farms for five years to see if the experiment really is a viable alternative to pesticides. In the meantime, farmers will have plenty of room to plant and harvest as usual, with the flower beds only taking up 2 percent of their land. The selected flowers include oxeye daisy, red clover, common knapweed, and wild carrot. There's a long list of reasons for farmers to phase out chemical pesticides, from the damage they do tolocal wildlifeto the threat they pose toour own health. Aslawmakersaround the world begin to crack down on them, you can expect to see more natural alternatives gain attention. #Wildflower#stripesused in#UKexperiment to combat crop#pestswith their#natural#predators>>>https://t.co/rsxZIjdi78pic.twitter.com/BtL8zDy7sJ [h/tThe Guardian]"

To curb pollution, California lawmaker Ian Calderon introduced a bill in January that would reduce plastic straw use in restaurants. Thanks to the measure's wording, it caused an uproar,Munchies reports. As it currently reads, restaurant employees would face $1000 fines or jail sentences of up to six months if they provide a straw to a customer unasked. Calderon, the majority leader of the California State Assembly, says that the bill wasn’t meant to be so harsh. He chalked its language up to miscommunication,explaining toThe Washington Postthat the California Office of Legislative Counsel drafted the bill into a state health code section with jail penalties. They didn’t have time to fix it, and Calderon planned to amend the bill’s wording before it reached a committee. (He still intends to remove its criminal penalties.) Backlash aside (one Republican politician called for people to mail Calderon their straws), Calderon simply wanted to introduce a measure that required sit-down restaurants to adhere to a straws-upon-request policy. Fast-food restaurants, cafés, and delis wouldn’t have to adhere to the guideline. “We need to create awareness around the issue of one-time use plastic straws and its detrimental effects on our landfills, waterways, and oceans,” Calderonsaidin a statement. “AB 1884 is not ban on plastic straws. It is a small step towards curbing our reliance on these convenience products, which will hopefully contribute to a change in consumer attitudes and usage.” Straws play a small—yet undeniable—part in our world’s ever-growing plastic waste problem. They typically wind up in landfills, and can end up in the ocean if proper disposal methods aren’t followed. This harms marine life, as fish and other creatures can mistake bits of broken-down straws for food. Cities in California, including Manhattan Beach, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Cruz, have implemented their own versions of a straw ban. Berkeley and Los Angeles might soon follow suit,according totheSan Francisco Chronicle. As for Calderon’s bill: It still needs to be revised, voted on, and approved. So nothing’s set in stone (or plastic) for now. [h/tMunchies]"
401,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/537113/cow-manure-and-elephant-dung-could-be-used-make-paper-future,,"The average dairy cow produces82 poundsof manure daily. For elephants, that number is up to300 pounds. According to researchers at the University of Vienna, all that dung represents an untapped resource that has the potential to change the way we make paper. The team of scientists presented their findings at a meeting of theAmerican Chemical Societyon March 21. Waste from cows and elephants, they say, is rich in the same cellulose that's required to make paper products. What's more, the cellulose in manure has been broken down by digestion, making it easier for paper manufacturers to process. ""Animals eat low-grade biomass containing cellulose, chew it and expose it to enzymes and acid in their stomach, and then produce manure,"" researcher Alexander Bismarck said in a statement. ""Depending on the animal, up to 40 percent of that manure is cellulose, which is then easily accessible."" Bismarck first got the idea to make paper from manure after seeing goats graze on dry grass in a small village in Crete. As he watched the plant matter go in, he wondered if that same matter wouldn't be suitable for making paper once it came out the other end. Today most paper is made by grinding down raw wood into nanocellulose, a process that takes a lot of power. The cellulose in dung has already been chewed and worn down by acid and enzymes in the animal's digestive system, cutting out the need for all that grinding. Following Bismarck's goat manure–inspired revelation, he and his team began working with waste from horses, cows, and now elephants. Thanks to cattle farms and elephant parks around the world, this material is an abundant sustainable resource. The dung they collect is treated with a sodium hydroxide solution to remove lignin, the glue that holds cellulose fibers together (and can also beused as fuel). From there, they filter out other impurities like proteins and dead cells and bleach whatever's left with sodium hypochlorite to create a pure, white pulp that's ready to be made into paper. The research team is currently exploring potential applications for the material. For now, they say it could be used as reinforcement for polymer composites or as filters for wastewater. It can also be made into paper for writing, though it may be a while until you see notebooks made from elephant dung at your local office supply store."

According to a new study published inScientific Reports, the creep of palm trees into higher latitudes could be another sign that our planet is changing. If our climate continues to warm, the tropical flora could soon be spotted as far north as Canada. In the new study, reported byEarther, researchers from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and two Canadian institutions looked at the temperature tolerances of palm species best suited for chillier weather. Many varieties don't need a year-round tropical climate to thrive: As long as the average temperature for the coldest month of the year for the region is above 36°F, some palms can grow in northern latitudes. This is why you can see palm trees in Greenville, North Carolina, where average temperatures for January fall above 36°F, but not Washington D.C., where average January temperatures tend to dip below that number. But that could soon change. As is the case with most northern states, average temperatures in D.C. are rising and winters aregetting milder, which means it's shaping up to be an inviting habitat for palm trees. Not all palm species tolerate the same climatic conditions, and the effects of the species' competition with native and non-native plants in more northerly regions remains to be seen. But if the palms do migrate that far north in the coming years, the Northeast, Northwest, and even parts of Canada could be next. A future of palm trees in Canada isn't as far-fetched as it may sound. Winters in these areas are already warm enough for people to plant palm trees in their gardens. In a controlled environment, these trees can flower and spread fruit, but average temperatures will need to climb a little higher before palm seedlings can survive in the wild. [h/tEarther]"

Arecent studyestimated that by 2050, more than 60 million people in the U.S. would be vulnerable to 100-year floods. Some cities plan to meet rising waters with protectiveparkland, while some architects are developing floatinghouses. And one company has figured out how to replace piles of sandbags as emergency flood control, asBusiness Insiderreports. Water-Gate, a line of flood protection products made by a Canadian company calledMegaSecur, is a self-deploying water barrier that can be used to stop overflowing water in its tracks. The emergency dam is made of folded canvas that, when water rushes into it, inflates up to become a kind of pocket for the water to get trapped in. You can roll it out across a street, a canal, or a creek like a giant hose, then wait for the water to arrive. In the event of a flash flood, you can even deploy it while the flood is already in progress. It can stop waters that rise up to five feet. According to MegaSecur, one Water-Gate dam can replace thousands of sandbags, and once the floodwaters have receded, you can fold it back up and use it again. Sadly, based on the flood projections of climate change scientists, heavy flooding will soon become more and more common, and that will make reusable flood barriers necessary, saving time and money that would otherwise be spent buying, stacking, and getting rid of sandbags. The auto-deployment also means that it can be used by a single person, rather than a team of laborers. It could just as easily be set up outside a house by a homeowner as it could be set up on a city street by an emergency worker. As climate change-related proposals go, it sounds a little more feasible than a floatinghouse. [h/tBusiness Insider]"
404,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/531692/germany-wants-fight-air-pollution-free-public-transit,,"Getting people out of their cars is an essential part of combating climate change. By one estimate, getting people to ditch their two-car household for just one car and a public transit commute could save up to 30 percent in carbon dioxide emissions [PDF]. But how do you convince commuters to take the train or the bus? In Germany, the answer may be making all public transit free, according toThe Local. According to a letter from three of Germany's government ministers to the European Union Environment Commissioner, in 2018, Germany will test free public transit in five western German cities, including Bonn. Germany hasfailedto meet EU air pollution limits for several years, and has been warned that it could face heavy fines if the country doesn't clean up its air. In a reportfrom 2017, the European Environment Agency estimated that 80,767 premature deaths in Germany in 2014 were due to air pollution. City officials in the regions where free transport will be tested say there may be some difficulty getting ahold of enough electric buses to support the increase in ridership, though, and their systems will likely need more trains and bus lines to make the plan work. Germany isn't the first to test out free public transportation, though it may be the first to do it on a nation-wide level. The Estonian capital of Tallinn tried in 2013, with less-than-stellar results. Ridership didn't surge as high as expected—one studyfoundthat the elimination of fares only resulted in a 1.2 percent increase in demand for service. And that doesn't necessarily mean that those new riders were jumping out of their cars, since those who would otherwise bike or walk might take the opportunity to hop on the bus more often if they don't have to load a transit card. Transportation isn't prohibitively expensive in Germany, and Germans already ride public transit at muchhigher ratesthan people do in the U.S. In Berlin, it costs about $4 a ride—more expensive than a ride in Paris or Madrid but about what you'd pay in Geneva, and cheaper than the lowest fare in London. And there are already discounts for kids, students, and the elderly. While that doesn't necessarily mean making public transit free isn't worth it, it does mean that eliminating fares might not make the huge dent in car emissions that the government hopes it will. What could bring in more riders? Improving existing service. According to research on transportation ridership, doing things like improving waits and transfer times bring in far more new riders than reducing fares. As onestudyputs it, ""This seldom happens, however, since transport managers often cannot resist the idea of reducing passenger fares even though the practice is known to have less impact on ridership."" The same study notes that increasing the prices of other modes of transit (say, making road tolls and parking fees higher to make driving the more expensive choice) is a more effective way of forcing people out of their cars and onto trains and buses. But that tends to be more unpopular than just giving people free bus passes. [h/tThe Local]"

Namie, Japan, which transformed into a ghost town following the 2011Fukushima nuclear disaster, is the initial test site of the project, dubbed ""The Reborn Light.""

For every seed ball urban gardeners purchase, the same amount will be donated to Seedbank for Schools, an organization working to ship seeds to every school in London by spring of 2019. Seed ball packages start at 20 balls, or a total of 600 wildflowers, for donations of $7. The wildflower-planting initiative is about more than beautifying the city of London. Flowers are also important for the survival of pollinators like bees, whose populations have taken a hit inthe UKand around the world in recent years. There are organizations similar to Seedball that encourage people to toss their wildflower seed ""bombs"" wherever bees might benefit from them.

408,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/518763/20-most-interesting-trees-around-world,,"Whether they bleed crimson sap or uncannily resemble human features, these 40 trees aren't your average oaks and elms. In 2009, a man from the southern Lebanese village of Hasbaya brought his 85-year-old olive tree to Beirut to be displayed. He believed its resemblance to an outstretched palm was miraculous and felt it should be shared with the public. Recognized by Ripley's Believe It or Not! in the 1930s as ""the tallest one-room house in the world,"" this redwood along northern California's Redwood Highway was hollowed out by a fire some 300 years ago. But it's still alive and thriving, and although no one lives there now, theinside is hometo some small mechanical toys. Despite the Ripley's recognition, it doesn't appear that anyone actuallylivedin the house, though a road construction crew stayed there for a week in the 1920s when building the road. If you're in the area and want to see another interesting spot, check out the nearbyLiving Chimney Tree, which is similar (minus the mechanical diversions). As the oldest known tree in France, Le Chêne Chapelle (""The Chapel Oak"") in the village of Allouville-Bellefosse has been around for at least 800 years, and some say it dates all the way back to the reign of Charlemagne. Though lightning struck the tree and rendered its center hollow during the 1600s, the tree managed to survive. A local abbot decided to make use of the hollow by erecting a shrine to the Virgin Mary inside; a second chapel and a staircase were later added. Sadly, the Chapel Oak isn't doing so well these days: Parts of the tree, including its 33-foot trunk, have died, and shingles cover the trunk where the bark is missing. In 1972, Ray Bradbury wrote the critically acclaimed novelThe Halloween Tree. In 2007, the tree was brought to life at Disneyland as part of its annual Halloween celebrations. The placement is fitting: Bradbury has long been a part of Disney history, from narrating Epcot’sSpaceship Earthride to writing the screenplay for the Disney filmsSomething Wicked This Way ComesandThe Wonderful Ice Cream Suit. The oak, located outside of the Golden Horseshoe Saloon, isfestoonedwith lights and adorned with hand-painted pumpkins. The dragon blood tree, native to Yemen, doesn't just look cool from the outside—it also ""bleeds"" red sap. Because of its crimson color, it's been speculated that the dragon's blood sap was used to give Stradivarius violins theirdistinct hue. It's easy to see why this tree has such a colorful name, buthowit gets its bright streaks is not as easy to explain. The ever-changing colors are due to the evolving bark of the eucalyptus. As the bark grows, it exfoliates thin layers of tissue, and as the layers peel off, the fresh, lime green bark underneath is revealed. As the exposed bark ages, it changes to dark green, then blue-purple, then pink-orange. The final stage before exfoliation starts again is a brownish-maroon hue, so the rainbow colors are really just different natural stages of bark development. At 65 feet tall and 28 feet in circumference, this massiveoak treeon Johns Island near Charleston, South Carolina, provides shade to an area of about 17,000 square feet. Oak trees usually grow up instead of out, but since this one is somewhere between 400 and 500 years old, it has had plenty of time to do both. The Angel Oak gets its name from former owners Justus and Martha Waight Tucker Angel, but the tree is now owned by the City of Charleston. The oldest living tree in Manhattan may also be the most notorious. Located in the northwest corner of Washington Square Park, the elm stands at nearly110 feet talland is estimated to be 330 years old. Though there are no public records to support it, the tree is said to have been used for hundreds of public hangings, from Revolutionary War traitors to prisoners from the nearby Newgate State Prison. There's a sad story that goes along with this bike that has been overtaken by a tree with an appetite: it's said that a young boy who lived on Vashon Island, Washington, left his bike leaning against the trunk in 1914, then went off to war and never came back to retrieve it. Fortunately, that story is made-up. Thereal story, according to resident Helen Puz, isn't quite so heartstring-tugging. In 1954, Puz's 8-year-old son Don inherited a girl's bike. He wasn't too happy about riding it, so when the bike somehow got ""misplaced,"" Don didn't look too hard for it. Fast-forward 40 years, when Puz read an article in the local paper about a bike that had been lifted five feet off the ground by a tree that grew up around it. She checked it out, and realized that Don's long-lost bike had been found. The 400 50-foot pine trees near Gryfino, Poland, which are believed to have been planted in the early 1930s, bend sharply at the trunk in a manner that hasscientists baffled. If the structure was the result of a genetic mutation, the trees would curve in places other than the base. And if the cause was environmental—say, snow weighing down the trunks as they were newly formed—then surrounding trees of the same type and age should have been similarly affected. One hypothesis is that local farmers manipulated the trees to curve for furniture purposes, but were prevented from harvesting them when World War II broke out. With a circumference of 154 feet, theSunland Baobabin Modjadjiskloof, South Africa, was once famous for being the widest Baobab in the world. Carbon-dated at around 1700 years old, the tree began to hollow out at around 1000 years old—which made it perfect for a small bar inside. Sadly, a large branch representing about one-third of the treesplit off in 2016, causing a lot of damage and permanently closing the bar inside. It’s said that this 200-year-old Banyan tree in Andhra Pradesh, India, is named for a widow named Thimmamma who threw herself onto her husband’s funeral pyre in 1433. Her sacrifice caused one of the poles to grow into the giant tree it is today, coveringfive acresof land and putting down 4000 prop roots. Today, couples pray at the tree for fertility, and anyone who removes its leaves is said to be cursed. The lattice on the tree above may be beautiful, but it's also deadly: the intricate pattern is actually the strangler fig slowly squeezing the life out of the tree it envelops. The fig tree grows when a bird or other animal drops its sticky seed in the branches of another tree. The seed is able to thrive on the tree's surface, and as it grows, its long roots reach down the host tree and, eventually, into the ground. The strangler fig can be found in tropical and subtropical zones, and is a frequent sight in southern Florida and the Keys. The national tree of Chile is certainly a distinctive one. Though theAraucaria araucanais more pyramid-shaped when it's young, it becomes rather top-heavy as it ages—and it can really age. Monkey puzzle trees can live to be up to 2000 years old and reach heights of about 164 feet. As a conifer, it produces edible cones calledpiñones. Now, about that unusual name: Legend has it that in the 1850s, when the trees were becoming popular as decorative plantings in English gardens, noted lawyer Charles Austin looked at one and remarked, ""It would puzzle a monkey to climb that."" There's a dark legend surrounding this unique boab tree in Western Australia: It's said that the tree's human-sized knothole made it the perfect prison cell during the 1890s, when prisoners were on their way to Derby for sentencing. Although the tree is on the State Heritage Register as ""prison boab tree"" and the signage around the tree acknowledges this supposed history, there doesn't appear to be muchevidencefor the tree being used as a cage. No one is quite sure how this Buddha head got so perfectly entwined in the roots of this tree at the Wat Mahathat temple inAyutthaya, Thailand, but there are plenty of theories. The statue was likely decapitated in 1767, when the Burmese army invaded and destroyed the ancient temple. The temple was abandoned until the 1950s, when restoration work began, and that's when the statue head was discovered. One theory is that the perfect juxtaposition happened to occur naturally when the statue piece fell within the tree roots just right. Another is that a thief placed it there to hide it in the 1900s, which is when part of the temple collapsed because of treasure hunters. However it happened, the head is there to stay—a guard is now stationed nearby to make sure that no souvenir-hunting tourists gets too grabby. The Wonderboom, or “Tree of Wonder,” is a 1000-year-oldfig treein Pretoria, South Africa. The tree is certainly impressive in size, standing 82 feet tall and boasting 13 trunks, but it also looms large in legend, too. Local lore says that an ancient chief buried at the base of the tree is what made it grow so extraordinarily large. As massive as the tree is now, it was once even bigger; in 1870, it was damaged in a fire started by a hunting party. At more than 32 feet in diameter and about 114 in height, the Árbol del Tule in the town of Santa María del Tule, Oaxaca, Mexico, is considered to be the broadest tree in the world. In fact, the Montezuma cypress is so stout that scientists once thought it was actually a few trees that had somehow merged together, but modern testing has revealed that the 1500-year-old tree really is just a single trunk. Planted sometime around 1930, this Monterey cypresstunnelat Point Reyes National Seashore, a park reserve in Marin County, California, marks a historic wireless transmission site that still stands today. In 1947, a Swedish-American farmer named Axel Erlandson turned his tree-shaping hobby into a tourist attraction. Erlandson, who had a knack for creating living art with trees and plants, was constantly experimenting with grafting trees together and encouraging multiple trunks to grow into one. When he had 60 to 70 fairly mature examples of artfully twisted trunks and branches, he dug them up and relocated them near Santa Cruz, California. The attraction garnered some attention from Ripley's Believe It or Not! andLIFEmagazine, and in 1963, Erlandson sold his grove of ""Circus Trees."" Sadly, he passed away in 1964 without telling anyone how he shaped the trees. ""I talk to them,"" he wasfond of tellinganyone who asked. Though they've passed from owner to owner through the years, these days, the trees are a main attraction at theGilroy Gardenstheme park. They're just beech trees, but the gnarled, foreboding tunnel they form has turned them into one of the most popular tourist attractions in Northern Ireland. The trees—about 150 of them—were planted 200 years ago by the Stuart family, who wanted to create an intimidating entrance to their home. Known as ""the Dark Hedges,"" the cluster of trees have made a handful of appearances in TV shows and movies, incudingGame of Thrones. Hoping to keep the trees healthy for another two centuries, the Department of Infrastructure recentlybanned vehiclesfrom driving on the road. That, of course, didn't stop powerful winds fromuprootingone of the trees in early 2019. The world’s tallest living tree, Hyperion looms nearly 380 feet tall in California’s Redwood National Park. That’s about75 feet tallerthan the Statue of Liberty, from the base of the pedestal to the tip. If it wasn’t for woodpecker damage near the top of the tree, Hyperion could have been even taller. Unless you’re in the know, you’ll probably never see Hyperion; its exact location has beenkept secretto protect it from vandals. Thesemacrocarpa(a type of cypress) trees in New Zealand may look like they're windblown, but they retain their extreme angles even on a calm day. Thestrange bendis the result of saplings surviving and thriving in the windy environment. The manager of the farm where the trees live says their photogenic branches conceal a secret—the ruins of a house that sheep now use for shelter. This tree in the Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen nature reserve near Ghent, Belgium has knotholes that makes it resemble Edvard Munch's 1893 paintingThe Scream. Also known as theTree Root Cave, this tree, located in Olympic National Park near Kalaloch, Washington, has managed to survive even though erosion has removed most of its support system. Located on the Monterey Peninsula in California, the Monterey Cypress is said to be themost photographed treein North America . Believed to be more than 250 years old, the single cypress tree clings to a rocky outcrop that juts out into the water. Sadly, the tree lost a major limb when it was damaged in a 2019 storm. If you’re a fan of cashews, this tree near Natal, Brazil, is your dream come true.Coveringabout two acres, what feels like a forest is actually the world’s largest cashew tree. A genetic mutation caused the branches to grow out instead of up, and when the branches eventually touch the ground, they root, causing the single tree to spread outward into a cashew wonderland. On April 24, 1873, Sheriff William Owen Smith of Lahainaplantedan 8-foot Banyan tree to honor the 50th anniversary of the first Protestant mission there. Residents encouraged the tree’s aerial roots to grow symmetrically by hanging glass jars filled with water from the branches they wanted to descend. And under their watchful eyes, the tree now stands more than 60 feet high and has 46 major trunks. It’s now the largest Banyan tree in the U.S. Named for the biblical figure that lived to be nearly 1000, the Methuselah Bristlecone Pine in the Inyo National Forest in Eastern California is almost five times as old. Thought to be around4800 years old, Methuselah has survived extreme elevations and winds to become the second-oldest tree in the world. (Old Tjikko in Sweden is the winner at 9500 years.) At up to 4000 years old, this yew tree in the village of Ashbrittle in Somerset, England, is ancient—predatingeven Stonehenge. The seven-trunked tree stands in the churchyard of St. John the Baptist, but maybe not for much longer. Half of the branches appear to be dead, and locals fear the yew may be battling a disease. But you don’t live to be several thousand years old without surviving a few rough patches: A tree doctor in the area says it will likely be just fine. Move over, Robin Hood: the Major Oak is the real star of Sherwood Forest. The biggest oak tree in Britain, the Major Oak weighs an estimated 23 tons and has a trunk circumference of more than 36 feet and a canopy spread of 91 feet. Its popularity as a tourist attraction caused officials to add supports and fence the area off in the 1970s, so you can’t camp beneath it as Robin Hood wasrumoredto have done—but you can still get a pretty decent selfie. In 1666, as the story goes, Isaac Newton was relaxing under a tree when an apple detached from its branch and beaned Newton on the noggin, dislodging the theory of gravity from his brain. According to theU.K. National Trust, you can see the very tree that inspired Newton at Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire, England. Though a storm blew the tree down in 1820, the Trust says the tree remained rooted and re-grew from the base, and that tree is the one still standing at Woolsthorpe—and dendrochronology confirms that it’s the right age. Cedar trees are synonymous with Lebanon. While the mountains were once thick with the ancient trees, deforestation and climate change have reduced their numbers—while the remaining copsesgrowing higherup the mountainside to chase the cooler climates they prefer. Only 10 square miles of cedars remain in Lebanon; its most famous patch, Cedars of God, has been fenced off and preserved since 1876. The locals in Sunderland, Massachusetts,claimthis 113-foot American sycamore is the ""widest tree east of the Mississippi."" A plaque proudly proclaims that the tree “lived here at the time of the signing of our Constitution,” and it has been estimated that it’s anywhere from 350 to 400 years old. California’s Sequoia National Park boasts thelargest treein the world by volume. The 2300 to 2700-year-old-tree wasdiscoveredby naturalist James Wolverton in 1879; he named for Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman, under whom Wolverton had served. In 2006, General Sherman’s largest branch—bigger than most tree trunks—broke off, smashing the perimeter fence and cratering the walkway below. There were no witnesses to the event, and it’s not believed that the incident is an indication of poor health in the tree. The Caesarsboom in Lo, Belgium, isn’t that impressive to look at—it’s a yew tree, and it’s lovely, but it’s certainly not massive in height or girth or volume. Its one claim to fame, however, is that during his travels to Britain, Julius Caesar once tied his horse to it while he had a drink. Modern historians have no way to ascertain whether this story has any basis in fact but, as Atlas Obscurapoints out, the city is crossed by what was once the Roman highway. To understand the Son of Tree That Owns Itself in Athens, Georgia, you have to know the story of its “father.” Sometime between 1820 and 1832, Colonel William Henry Jacksondeededa white oak tree on his property—to itself. As the story goes, he had fond childhood memories of the tree and wanted to reward it. The tree entered local legend, even receiving an engraved plaque with its story on it. Sadly, Tree That Owns Itself fell into decline in the early 1900s after suffering natural erosion and damage from an ice storm, and toppled over on October 9, 1942. Luckily, people saw the tree’s demise coming and gathered acorns to produce saplings. Hence, Son of Tree That Owns Itself was planted on the same spot on December 4, 1946. Tāne Mahuta, Maorian for “Lord of the Forest,” is the largest kauri tree in New Zealand. The 148-foot-tall tree, estimated to be up to 2500 years old, is one of the last remnants of an ancient subtropical rainforest on the North Auckland Peninsula.According toMaori mythology, ""Tāne is the son of Ranginui the sky father and Papatuanuku the earth mother. Tāne was the child that tore his parents' parental embrace and once done set about clothing his mother in the forest we have here today. All living creatures of the forest are regarded as Tāne's children. The next time you find yourself on the campus of East Central University in Ada, Oklahoma, take a peek at the tree stump located at the entrance. The petrified stump there belongs to a Callixylon tree, a long-extinct species with fern-like leaves. Estimated to be250 million years old, the stump was discovered at a nearby farm and was donated to ECU after a brief scuffle with the Smithsonian. A sacred fig, the Sri Maha Bodhi is said to be the exact spot where Gautama Buddha, the Supreme Buddha, found enlightenment. Many trees have since been propagated from the original Bodhi tree, and several of them are now the center of worship themselves—including theJaya Sri Maha Bodhiof Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It’s said to be the oldest-living human-planted tree in existence and was propagated in 288 B.C."
409,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/518364/biological-house-was-built-upcycled-grass-straw-and-seaweed,,"The Danish architectural firmEen Til Eenhas revealed the latest step forward in sustainable housing: the world’s first “Biological House.” The home was built using materials made from agricultural waste, including grass, straw, and seaweed, and was conceptualized in collaboration with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency. Not only is the reuse of this material healthier for the environment, it also prevents the harmful effects of burning the waste, which is what normally happens to this type of agricultural residue if there is no use for it,according to Curbed. “It sounds like science fiction that you can build a house from things such as tomato stems, straw and seaweed, which is just as durable as normal buildings and at the time has a healthy economy and complies with the rules,” Danish Environmental MinisterKirsten Brosbøl said. “However, the Biological House shows that it is possible here and now. I appreciate that way we really get some value from materials that otherwise would end up at an incineration plant.” In addition to the agricultural waste being used for most of the raw building material—including tomato stems and woodchips being turned into composite boards—eco-friendlyKebony woodwas used for the home’s outer cladding. According to Kebony, 40 partners were used in the construction of the home, each with an eye toward sustainability and environmental responsibility. ""Being part of this strategic partnership has been a real privilege,” Mona Gøtske, Country Manager Kebony Denmark,said. “[And] we are thrilled to have provided a façade solution for the world’s first Biological House that demonstrates the strength and sustainable values of Kebony in the best possible way.” The modular home was built on screw piles, which allows it to be moved without tearing up soil the way a traditional concrete foundation would, asInhabitat reported. Before it was unveiled, Een Til Een constructed this “Biological House” in secrecy in Middelfart, Denmark. But now that the project has been successfully completed,World Architecture Newsreports that the doors are open for visitors from all around the world to walk in and look upon the house that tomato stems built.

While art lovers worried when they heard that Los Angeles's Getty Center would beclosing its doorsthis week, as the fires closed part of the 405 Freeway, there was a bit of good news. According to museum officials, the priceless works housed inside the famed Getty Center are said to be perfectly secure and won't need to be evacuated from the facility. “The safest place for the art is right here at the Getty,” Ron Hartwig, the Getty’s vice president of communications,toldtheLos Angeles Times.According to its website, the museum was closed on December 5 and December 6 “to protect the collections from smoke from fires in the region,” but as of now, the art inside is staying put. Though every museum has its own way ofprotecting the priceless worksinside it, theLos Angeles Timesnotes that the Getty Center was constructed in such a way as to protect its contents from the very kind of emergency it's currently facing. The air throughout the gallery is filtered by a system that forces it out, rather than a filtration method which would bring air in. This system will keep the smoke and air pollutants from getting into the facility, and by closing the museum this week, the Getty is preventing the harmful air from entering the building through any open doors. There is also a water tank at the facility that holds 1 million gallons in reserve for just such an occasion, and any brush on the property is routinely cleared away to prevent the likelihood of a fire spreading. The Getty Villa, a separate campus located in the Pacific Palisades off the Pacific Coast Highway, wasalso closedout of concern for air quality this week. The museum is currently working with the police and fire departments in the area to determine the need for future closures and the evacuation of any personnel. So far, the fires have claimed more than83,000 acresof land, leading to the evacuation of thousands of people and the temporary closure of I-405, which runs right alongside the Getty near Los Angeles’s Bel-Air neighborhood."

AsFast Companyreports, the San Francisco-based startup rewards California residents for their green choices with real cash. The mission of the company is to prevent energy grids from using costly and dirty emergency power plants by encouraging customers to conserve power when demand outweighs supply. During “OhmHours,” users receive a text suggesting energy-saving practices. They can choose to opt out or agree to make an effort to lower their consumption. If their usage in the next hour is lower than the average for their home on that type of day (weekdays are compared to the weekday average; weekends to the weekend average) they receive points which can be redeemed for money. The more people participate on a regular basis, the more points they’re able to earn. Participants in homes equipped with smart devices like a Nest thermostat or Belkin smart switches can program them to automatically consume less during those times. Nearly a fifth of the user base chooses some type of automatic response. Someone living in a small apartment participating once a week has the potential to make $40 to $50 a year, while a family living in a larger home can earn up to $200. The California energy grid has also reaped the benefits: Since launching in2014, OhmConnect has saved the state a total of 100 megawatts (the equivalent of not running two emergency power plants at high-demand times). California residents who get their energy through Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, or San Diego Gas & Electric can sign up to participateonline. If you don’t live in the state but are interested in the service, you may get a chance to try it out soon: OhmConnect plans to expand to Texas, Toronto, and potentially the East Coast.

Soskin, who originally hails from Detroit, works at the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond, California. The national parkpreservesthe history of the U.S. home front during World War II, including the businesses, innovations, and people that helped make victory possible. (Richmond was once home to more than 56 different war industries.) Today, Soskin gives interpretive tours of the park. But long ago, she worked as a World War II file clerk for the all-black Boilermakers A-36. Soskin—the great-granddaughter of a freed slave—gained local prominence as an activist, and fame as a songwriter, during the Civil Rights Movement. But history ended up being just as important to Soskin as current political events when she served as a consultant with the National Park Service for the Rosie the Riveter Park in the early 2000s. Soskin was the only person of color at the planning table,according to NPR. She ensured that the historic park didn’t erase memories of the segregation that had once existed at factories and shipyards, as doing so would also erase the history of the area’s African-American population.

Luxury liners consumetons of fueland produce even more sewage that is often dumped directly into the ocean. But cruises don’t have to be disastrous for the Earth by design: Asinhabitatreports, the newly-designedEcoshipaims to be the most eco-friendly cruise ship on the seas. The futuristic vessel was envisioned by the firmOliver Designfor the Japanese humanitarian organizationPeace Boat. For decades, Peace Boat has been spreading its message of global social change through “peace voyages” that sail around the world. The Ecoship will embody this mission by being kinder to the environment than conventional cruise ships. Ten photovoltaic solar sails extend from the deck like giant fins, collecting clean energy to supplement the hybrid engine. Retractable wind generators harvest energy as well. According to Oliver Design, the Ecoship will produce 30 percent less carbon dioxide than modern cruise ships. The vessel’s electrical system has also been updated with both the solar sails and kinetic floors onboard providing power. The biggest change comes in the sewage operations: Both the waste and water will be fed through a closed loop, which means that whatever’s produced is filtered and recycled again and again. As these features are working behind the scenes, passengers will get to see some Earth-friendly amenities up close. A “plant kingdom” that covers five decks will consume surplus waste, water, and carbon dioxide produced by the ship, while vertical farms will be used to grow vegetables for meals. When the Ecoship sets sail in 2020, it will continue to spread awareness of the changing climate that inspired its design. Oliver Design writes on its webpage, “The organization [Peace Boat] wants the Ecoship to be a turning point for the shipping industry and a flagship for raising awareness on climate change. As well as hosting Peace Boat’s voyages throughout the world, the ship will be used to stage exhibitions on green technology at the 100 ports where it is expected to dock each year.” You can check out the concept art for the project in the video below.

414,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/523882/man-made-mountain-finland-serves-11000-tree-time-capsule,,"In 1982, the conceptual artistAgnes Denesset out to make a mountain. After a decade of work, she made it happen. In 1992, the Finnish government announced that it would sponsor Denes’sTree Mountain—a 125-foot-tall manmade mountain built on top of a former gravel pit, designed to serve as part time capsule, part ecological recovery project. Tree Mountain — A Living Time Capsulewas constructed on the site of a former gravel pit near Ylöjärvi, Finland between 1992 and 1996. The artificially constructed landmass stands 125 feet tall, almost 1400 feet long, and more than 885 feet wide. (The top image of the triptych above shows the mountain in 1992 and the bottom image in 2013.) The forest planted on it forms a precise mathematical pattern Agnes designed based on thegolden ratio-derived spirals ofsunflowersand pineapples. From above, the oval mountain looks like a giant fingerprint made up of whorls of trees. The project was never intended to just be aesthetically pleasing. Envisioned as a way to rehab land destroyed by mining, the trees are meant to develop undisturbed for 400 years, creating what will eventually be an Old Growth forest that can reduce erosion, provide wildlife habitats, and boost oxygen production. And it was a communal effort. The roughly 11,000 pine trees were planted by different individuals who then became the custodians of those trees. Each received a certificate declaring their ownership for the project’s full term of 400 years. They can pass along this ownership to their descendants or to others for as many as 20 generations. These custodians (which include former UK prime minister John Major and former Icelandic president Vigdís Finnbogadóttir) are even allowed to be buried under their trees.

Using data from NASA's Aura satellite, scientistswere able to measurethe chemical composition of the thinned gas layer above the Antarctic and found about 20 percent less ozone depletion than there was in 2005. Theypublished their findingson January 4 in the journalGeophysical Research Letters. In 1985, UK scientists published a landmark study in the journalNatureannouncing their discovery of an annually recurring hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. (Each September, as the Southern Hemisphere's winter arrives, the Sun's UV rays trigger a reaction between the ozone and chemical elements from CFCs, chlorine and bromine, which destroys the ozone molecules.) The finding led to theMontreal Protocolin 1987, an international treaty that gradually banned the production and use of CFCs in refrigerants, aerosol sprays, solvents, and air conditioners. In July 2016, Antarctic researcherspublished a studyin the journalSciencereporting that the ozone layer appeared to be healing (although it wasn't projected to completely patch up for decades). They tracked this progress by monitoring the Antarctic ozone hole's area, height, and chemical profile. Still, they didn't know whether this progress could be attributed to the Montreal Protocol's mandate. NASA itself has used Aura to monitor the hole since the mid-2000s. After analyzing data produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder, a satellite instrument aboard Aura that measures trace gases, the space agency has confirmed that the CFC ban has led to the big decrease in ozone depletion during the Antarctic winter. By winter, ozone-busting chlorine compounds have converted into hydrochloric acid, a process that occurs after it's destroyed ozone particles and reacts with methane. ""By around mid-October, all the chlorine compounds are conveniently converted into one gas, so by measuring hydrochloric acid, we have a good measurement of the total chlorine,"" researcher Susan Strahan said in a NASAstatement. Scientists compared these hydrochloric acid levels with nitrous oxide, which is similar in nature to CFCs but isn't diminishing in the atmosphere. Their study is billed as ""the first to use measurements of the chemical composition inside the ozone hole to confirm that not only is ozone depletion decreasing, but that the decrease is caused by the decline in CFCs,"" according to NASA. But while these initial results are promising, scientists say that the ozone layer's full recovery is still a long way off. ""As far as the ozone hole being gone, we're looking at 2060 or 2080,” study co-author Anne Douglass said. “And even then there might still be a small hole."""
416,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/518666/dutch-designers-want-turn-algae-greener-consumer-products,,"For the pastseveral decades, plastic—often made from carbon dioxide-producing fossil fuels—has dominated our stores, homes, and landfills. Two Dutch designers propose a green alternative that can be found growing in your local pond. AsDezeenreports,Eric KlarenbeekandMaartje Drosbelieve their algae-derived biopolymer could one day replace petroleum-based plastic all together. The pair developed the material after studying algae at various institutions in the Netherlands for three years. Following that period, they founded an open research and algae production lab at theLuma Foundationin Arles, France. Once they cultivate the living algae, the designers then dry it and process it to make the moldable material. The polymer can be fed into special 3D printers that use it to churn out items like bowls and vases. Klarenbeek and Dros envision a future where communities have access to a network of these biopolymer 3D printers, which they call “the 3D Bakery.” Instead of purchasing goods that have been shipped across the world, consumers could stop into a store and “bake” their purchases from the algae-stocked 3D printer on site. They claim that dishware, trash cans, and shampoo bottles can be made this way. The algae lab does more than eliminate the harmful CO2 byproducts from plastic production—it also purifies the air of existing CO2. Algae consumes the gas from the water and atmosphere as it grows while expelling clean oxygen. The result is a process that goes one step beyond zero emissions. Klarenbeek and Dros aren’t the first people to think to replace plastic with organic algae. Designer Ari Jónsson successfully used the plant to makewater bottlesthat biodegrade over time. The products coming out of the algae lab, on the other hand, are made to last longer. The design duo plans to start supplying their biopolymer to restaurants and catering companies within the city of Arles. To see how they harvest the raw algae used to make their products, check out the video below. [h/tDezeen]"

418,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/503007/meet-biologists-who-rescue-whales-trapped-fishing-gear,,"Scott Landry and his team had been searching the waters of Cape Cod Bay for hours without any luck. For several days in September, mariners had reported to theCenter for Coastal Studiesin Provincetown, Massachusetts, that they'd seen a humpback whale trailing ropes and buoys from its enormous body. Landry, the center's director for marine animal entanglement response, knew time was growing short: Every day a whale spends entangled costs it precious energy and increases its chances of dying. The crew had checked every reported location and was growing concerned about the fading daylight when a whale-watching boat called to say it had spotted the animal more than 20 miles away. The five-member team sped out of the bay on their 35-foot, 600-horsepower rigid inflatable boat toward the animal's last known location. Finally spotting it, they worked to get close enough for a clear look at how the ropes and buoys were wrapped around the whale's body. It wasn't easy. The boat bounced in the wind and rough seas. The whale moved quickly and obscurely, diving for up to seven minutes at a time. No one knew what direction the animal was moving or where it would surface. When it did come up for air, it disappeared again almost immediately. ""We need a clear idea of how a whale is entangled to disentangle it properly,” Landry tells Mental Floss. “We had about two seconds when it came up for a breath."" When he finally got a look, the news wasn't good. ""It was the worst kind of entanglement—a rope wrapped around its upper jaw,"" Landry recalls. Because a whale's head is seldom above the surface and ropes there may not trail as far, they prove hardest to remove. ""The whale was moving at high speed, we were moving at high speed, and we had to pace alongside it and get within 30 feet to cut it free. The window of time and the target were both small."" This time of year, many humpback whales travel from feeding grounds off the coast of Canada and New England to winter calving grounds in waters around Florida and the Caribbean, a journey of more than 1000 miles. A surprising number of them are dragging materials along with them—rope, nets, and other gear in which they've become hopelessly entangled. Increased fishing in areas where whales forage has resulted in more entanglements, which can kill them. Humpback whalesreach weights of 80,000 pounds and lengths up to 60 feet. You need a good reason to approach one of these massive creatures in a small craft on the open ocean. The special teams that free the whales believe it's worth risking their lives to save these endangered cetaceans. These teams exist all over the world. Landry's institute, the Center for Coastal Studies, has freed more than 200 large whales and other marine animals since 1984. It belongs to theAtlantic Large Whale Disentanglement Network, which includes National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) fisheries offices, state offices, and research institutions from Florida to Canada. The U.S. had 123 confirmed entangled whale cases in 2016 alone, but the ones we see likely represent only a fraction of the total. Jamison Smith, disentanglement coordinator for NOAA, tells Mental Floss that lack of centralized record-keeping early on means no one knows the actual number, but since the early 1980s, it has hit at least the low thousands. At least 83 percent of North Atlantic right whales became entangled at least once between 1980 and 2009, and more than half of the humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine have had at least one entanglement. ""Right whales and humpbacks have a huge problem,"" Michael Moore, senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), tells Mental Floss. ""Something radical has to happen, or these species are going to go away."" Marine animals get caught up in just about anything humans put in the water, and we put in a lot of stuff—commercial fishing gear, recreational fishing gear, buoy warning systems, trash. ""This problem plagues whales throughout the world,"" Amy Knowlton, research scientist at the New England Aquarium'sAnderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, tells Mental Floss. ""It is one of the biggest conservation issues for marine mammals."" Whales off U.S. coasts most often get tangled in active fishing gear. On the East Coast, it's mostly snow crab and lobster gear. At the height of lobster season, close to a million vertical lines lurk in waters off Maine, and North Atlantic right whales, which arefacing extinctionin part due to entanglements, may encounter these lines about 2500 times a year. These plankton-grazing whales, which can reach 55 feet long and weigh 128,000 pounds, move slowly through the ocean with open mouths, so most entanglements start there, Knowlton explains. Once ensnared, the whales tend to thrash and roll, which only makes the problem worse, wrapping the ropes through their baleen and around their heads and flippers. On the West Coast, where NOAA had 71 reports of whale entanglements in 2016, the vast majority in the past two years involved Dungeness crab fishing gear, located along the entire coast. Last year, for example, that gear was responsible for 22 out of 29 entanglements that NOAA definitively associated with specific fisheries or gear types. Ghost nets—abandoned fishing gear drifting in the ocean—also entangle whales, as does other debris. Junk tends to be more prevalent in certain parts of the ocean, accumulating in gyres and along currents. More debris equals more entanglements. In a2012 paperinConservation Biology, WHOI researcher Julie van der Hoop reported that scientists determined cause of death for 43 percent of 1762 known whale mortalities in the Northwest Atlantic between 1970 and 2009. Of those, 67 percent resulted from human interactions, and entanglement in fishing gear was the primary cause of death. Entanglement can cause whales to drown or seriously injure and eventually kill them. If they survive, the gear can easily double the drag an animal experiences as it moves through the water. ""They can't feed, and they exert a lot more energy just to swim, dragging that gear,"" Knowlton says. ""Their health declines and, if they don't drown at the outset, they experience a slow, painful death."" Expending that extra energy can mean the difference between a female successfully reproducing or not, according to Moore, and with so few right whales remaining, reproduction is critical to survival of the species. ""The calving rate in North Atlantic right whales has been sparse, driven to some degree by lack of food but also wasteful pursuits such as swimming through the water pulling a whole bunch of excess drag,"" Moore says. Even whales that free themselves or are freed by humans experience stress, pain, and loss of energy. In order to disentangle a whale, you first have to find it. ""When you consider the size of the ocean, the odds of that happening are incredibly small,"" Landry says. In some areas, most reports come from commercial fishing operations. The research community and the public also report whales in need of help. Once a team reaches the whale, they have to assess the situation before taking any action. ""You might think we just get in there and start cutting stuff off the whale,"" he continues. ""But we found through trial and error that doesn't help. You have to understand how the whale is entangled and strategically cut things away. Every situation, every whale differs. Sea conditions differ. No two disentanglements are alike."" Often, the first step is for a crew member to use grappling hooks to attach buoys to the animal to help them track it and slow it down. This tactic is one of many they use that was inspired by historic whaling techniques, Smith says, but there's a key difference: ""They were trying to kill the whale and we're trying to save it, which is harder to do."" Meanwhile, another crew member with a camera on a long pole assesses the situation. The team then determines the best approach and attempts to cut the whale free using specially designed knives on long poles. ""You're running on adrenaline, focused on the animal and the gear and how to best access that in a safe manner,"" Knowlton says. ""I've spent a lot of time with right whales, and feel I have a sense of what to expect, but they always throw surprises at you. It is not a comfortable situation to be in. I really wish nobody had to be in it."" Keeping crews safe remains priority one. Whales are large, powerful animals. Entanglement creates stress and—despite a popular misconception that whales understand our motives—they have no idea we are trying to help them, Landry says. ""Their response is a fear response. Most deal with it by trying to flee, but others will try to defend themselves."" Even so, only one person has died while disentangling a whale under current protocols. Joe Howlett, a long-time member of the Campobello Whale Rescue Team in Canada, was killed July 10, 2017, off New Brunswick by a just-freed right whale, which may have breached or flipped. Network members plan a response based on the animal's distance from shore, weather, time of day, and availability of resources such as boats and crew. ""The biggest challenge is trying to keep a consistent crew on call day in and day out, year after year,"" Landry says. The success rate varies. ""If we can get our hands on the whale, figuratively, we have about an 85 percent chance of disentangling a humpback,"" Landry says. ""A 50 to 60 percent chance on a right whale."" Knowlton points out that 25 percent of all entangled animals reported just disappear: ""A lot more we see multiple times, but weather and other challenges mean we can't get out there. In short, disentanglement is not the solution."" Eliminating whale entanglement entirely would require keeping all rope and debris out of the ocean—not a likely scenario. But lawmakers and scientists are working on solutions. Seasonal restrictions on fishing and modification of gear could help. Rope strength plays a role, according to Knowlton. Strength of ropes used by commercial fishing has increased, and with it, the severity of whale injuries. Using rope that breaks at 1700 pounds—more than strong enough for the majority of fishing needs but something a whale likely could break—could reduce probability of mortality by 72 percent. Developing gear that doesn't use ropes could make an even bigger difference. This has been done in parts of the world, and oceanographic researchers routinely retrieve gear using GPS and tracking technology and not ropes. ""With economies of scale, that could be conceivable for fisheries,"" Moore says. ""The argument that you need a plastic float on the surface to know where a trap is set is a little antiquated given the technology we have now."" Ropeless methods could even help fishermen, because they lose gear to whale entanglements. As for the whale Landry's team pursued in September, after an hour of near misses, the team was able to finally get close enough to cut the rope free with a hook-shaped knife on the end of a 30-foot pole. As they always do, they removed the rope and buoys from the water. (The National Marine Fisheries Service archives all removed gear for continued study, with the ultimate aim of better understanding and, ultimately, preventing entanglement.) Had the tourist boat not happened upon the whale, it almost certainly would have died. ""That's one of our biggest fears,"" Landry says. ""It was just a tiny chance for someone to see that whale before it left the area entirely and went somewhere we would never find it."" It's happened before, he notes. ""You win some and lose some. It's a big responsibility. On the bright side, more often than not, we're able to get the job done."""
419,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/527143/see-squirrel-these-citizen-scientists-want-know-about-it,,"If you spot a squirrel, Jamie Allen wants to know about it. In 2011, Allen, an Atlanta-based writer, found himself wondering exactly how manysquirrelsthere were in the world around him. And so he and another squirrel-curious friend decided to launch theSquirrel Census, an effort to count all the squirrels in his neighborhood. Several woodland-rodent tallies later, the Squirrel Census has gone national. The first squirrel count began in Atlanta’s Inman Park, where Allen lives, in the spring of 2012, followed by another in the fall of 2015. For each, the Squirrel Census team created an elaborate visual guide to the data for the public, squirrel-obsessed and not. Now, this fall, the project is branching out. Allen and his fellow squirrel counters are organizing a Central Park Squirrel Census for October 2018 with help from local universities, the New York City Parks Department, and other groups. According to the Squirrel Census website, the project is focused “on the Eastern gray (Sciurus carolinensis), his pals, and his mortal enemies.” With its distinctly whimsical site design, filled with animated squirrels and an unexplained pop-up image of author Tom Clancy, you’d be forgiven for thinking the wildlife census is somewhat of a lark. And it is partly a storytelling exercise—the 2016 version of the Squirrel Census report, called Land of a Thousand Squirrels, included not just infographics and a map on the Inman Park squirrel population, but fiction and “general fun,” as Allen told Mental Floss in an email. But it has real scientific methodology, too. The Squirrel Census team includes an Emory University epidemiologist, a veterinarian, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife fire specialist, and a wildlife illustrator, as well as a small legion of designers, fundraisers, logistics specialists, and other supporters. To estimate squirrel populations, the team uses an established wildlife-counting formula that has previously been used by scientists to study events like the GreatSquirrel Migrationof 1968. They break the area they want to study into quadrants and send volunteers out with clipboards, maps, and specific questions to tally squirrels over a set amount of time. Since the first census, Allen and the Squirrel Census team have thrown events to bring their results to the public, spoken at Emory University and other colleges about their methods and results, and launched an iPhone app, calledSquirrel Sighter, to allow citizen scientists to contribute data from aroundthe world. Each time a user indicates they've seen a squirrel (dead or alive) in the app, the Atlanta-based Squirrel Census team gets an update with data on the date and time, the location of the sighting, and the weather conditions there. The app, and the census itself, is meant as a way to “attract people to the idea of sighting squirrels, which are normally so common as to be invisible,” according to Allen, as well as to encourage people to “realize the strange joy of just taking a moment to get outside of their own heads and pay attention to something else.” And of course, in the process, they’ll gather a huge chunk of data that can be used to study wildlife populations in urban areas. “There are many reasons to do any wildlife census,” Allen tells Mental Floss. “Information is power, it's educational, and our data has been used in academic studies on squirrel populations. But for me, the simple idea of a census allows people to appreciate their surroundings in entirely different and new ways.”"

In 1969, a nearby Borden factory had issues with its exhaust vents. All clogged up, they wound up emittingpowdered creamerinto the air, which would dispense over the town and collect on surfaces to make for a milky, sticky nuisance when it got wet. Borden eventually fixed its workplace issues. (It also paid a small fine.) Surprisingly, this phenomenon isn't restricted to gentlemen's clubs. In 2007, a resident of Worms, Germanystopped her carto collect a small storm of paper euro notes that were swirling around her. Despite the enigmatic source of the cash, the woman felt it was best to report it to area police.

Fortunately, no one was devoured when a large, gooey, translucent globedroppedinto a resident's yard in Miami in 1958. Observers said it had a honeycomb design and pulsated as though it were alive. One brave police officer stuck a finger into it without any consequence. Before it could be studied further, the mass just dried up. We're not quite sure what home insurance companies say when you file a report saying a two pound camera lens has just come crashing through your roof, but homeowner Debbie Payne probably found out. In 2011, a Canon camera lensburst through her home, leaving a cratered rooftop and other damage. Called to investigate, the Federal Aviation Administration said that such an object falling from an aircraft was possible but hard to prove. Payne lived just 200 feet from an elementary school and said she was grateful the projectile didn't land there. In 1977, a British couple were strolling down a street in Bristol when the husband, Alfred Wilson Osbourne, heard a click and thought buttons had fallen off his coat. He quickly realized the clatter on the pavement wasn't a clothing malfunction but ashower of hazelnuts, which were falling down all around him. After a brief pause, another man experienced the same odd nut fall in the same spot. You'd expect a looming hazelnut tree to be the cause, but none were reported to be in the area. And even if there had been, it was March—far from hazelnut season. Residents in Lake County, California were surprised to seeclumps of sugarraining down over two days in September 1857. The candy portions were about a quarter-inch in size and seemingly edible: Some of the residents there made syrup from the phenomena. In 1901, editors ofSciencemagazine recorded an account of amud showerin Easton, Pennsylvania courtesy of a reader from Lafayette College who wrote in to describe the incident. ""Window glasses on the western exposure of houses were covered with thousands of drops of dirty water,"" he wrote. Under a microscope, he observed ""little membranous bags containing grains of dust."" Some theorized a dust storm had mixed with precipitation to create a brown deluge of filthy rain. Detritus from aircraft is not an uncommon source of falling objects, but it's hard to conceive of what an 18-inch length of chain would be doing in a plane. In 1959, a man named Wallace Baker was working a bulldozer in Missouri when thechain fellon his equipment. That would be plenty unusual, but what astounded Baker was the fact that the chain was so hot it was glowing. When he tried to pick it up, it burned his work gloves. No source was ever located. The most unfortunate of all rain substitutes is actually not all that uncommon: Some models of airplane toilets discharge wastewater in such a way that leaking contents createfreezing globsof poop that break free of the aircraft and plummet to the ground below.

Most of these bombs contain volatile TNT, and when these chemicals are released they contaminate the surrounding soil and water, poisoning the plants and animals that depend on those natural resources [PDF]. A lot of time and money is invested in deactivating leftover land mines in a clean and safe way, but new research published inPLOS ONEsuggests that bomb squads may be better off blowing them up. AsGizmodoreports, the study, conducted by Australian and Scottish researchers, shows that detonating land mines ends up causing less harm to the environment than deactivating them and removing them from the ground. At first this might seem counterintuitive: How can a large explosion do less damage to the environment than a bomb that never goes off? But the violent impact of the bomb is ultimately what allows for cleaner soil. When a land mine is detonated, that explosion disrupts the surrounding soil, causing it to become loose and porous. The new air pockets in the dirt leave room for bacteria to squirm through and consume pollutants, a process called bioremediation. Researchers found that the site of a detonated land mine had lower levels of TNT after six weeks than the site of a deactivated one, thanks to greater activity from these toxin-munching bacteria. Previous research had mainly examined the effect of detonation on the exterior of soil aggregates. This study is the first to investigate the effects of landmine blasts on the soil's interior structure, and the findings could lead to better methods of bioremediation in polluted sites, the authors note in the study. Land mines are a major threat in areas touched by war. There’s still no one technique used by bomb squads to sniff them out (dronesandratsare just a couple of the tools currently in play), but when they are located, the new research may change the way these explosives are handled.

Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin examined data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' annualAmerican Time Use Survey, finding that between 2003 and 2012, people spent more time at home and less time traveling to and from stores and work. According to this data, Americans in 2012 spent a total of 7.8 more days at home than in 2003 and 1.2 fewer days traveling. That means they weren't getting in their cars and burning up fossil fuels to drive around town. And, if fewer people are working in offices overall, presumably those buildings require less energy to run (for example, they don't need as much power for lights or air conditioning). In total, the researchers estimate that Americans used 1.8 percent less energy as a nation because of this home-bound change in lifestyle. Considering that these metrics are from 2012, it's likely that people are spending even less time traveling outside their houses these days.

Average energy expenses vary from state to state due to factors like weather, house size, and local gas prices. Using data from sources including the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency,WalletHubcalculated the average monthly utility bill totals for all 50 states plus Washington D.C. in 2017. Source:WalletHub The personal finance website looked at four energy costs: electricity, natural gas, car fuel, and home heating oil. After putting these components together, Connecticut was found to be the state with the highest energy costs in 2017, with an average of $380 in monthly bills, followed by Alaska with $332 and Rhode Island with $329. That includes data from the summer and winter months. For a better picture of which state’s residents spend the most on heat, we have to look at the individual energy costs. Michigan, which ranks 33rd overall, outdoes every other state in the natural gas department with an average bill of $60 a month. Alaska is close behind with $59, followed by Rhode Island With $58. People living in Maine prefer oil to heat their homes, spending $84 a month on the fuel source. All six New England states—Maine, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts—occupy the top six spots in this category. So which state should you move to if you want to see your heating bill disappear? In Florida, the average household spends just $3 a month on natural gas and $0 on heating oil. In Hawaii, on average, the oil bill is $0 as well, and slightly higher for gas at $4. Of course, they make up for it when it comes time to crank up the AC: Both states break the top 10 in highest electricity costs."
425,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/521379/troubling-consequences-vanishing-ice-glacier-national-park,,"The very name of Glacier National Park, a 1-million-acre expanse in northwest Montana on the Canadian border, comes from ice. But the name may need to change by 2030: Experts predict the formations could disappear by then. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the glaciers in Glacier National Park have shrunk by anaverageof 39 percent since 1966; some lost up to85 percentof their ice. A 2014 study inScienceattributes global loss in glacier mass to both anthropogenic (or human caused) and natural climate changes. The study blames human causes for about a quarter of the loss between 1851 and 2010, but that shareincreased steadilyand accelerated to account for almost two-thirds of the loss between 1991 and 2010. Glaciers are one of the main reasons 2.9 million people visited the eponymous national park in 2016. But the looming loss of these formations has many significant ramifications. Moreover, the changes at the park are representative of what's happening globally—and visitors can see these changes for themselves. Glaciers are masses of ice, snow, water, rock, and sediment that move under the influence of gravity. To determine just how many glaciers it has, Glacier National Park follows the commonly accepted guideline from the USGS Climate Change in Mountain Ecosystems Program: a body of ice must be at least25 acresto be considered a glacier. Based on that guideline, the number of glaciers in the park dropped from 150 in the late 19th century to 26 today. Those that remain have shrunk significantly, as clearly seen in these images of Swiftcurrent Glacier below, from 1930 (top) and 2015 (bottom). Swiftcurrent is only one example. In 2017, the USGS published a time series analysis of the margins of named glaciers in the park, with measurements from 1966, 1998, 2005, and 2015/2016. Scientists used aerial photography and satellite imagery to measure glacier perimeters in late summer when seasonal snow had melted, revealing the extent of the glacial ice. The data show reduced area of all glaciers since 1966. Photography isn't the only way to monitor the size of a glacier. Scientists also analyze mass balance—essentially, a glacier's gains and losses over a season. According to data, glaciers the world over, not just in Glacier National Park, are seeing more losses in ice than gains. An inventory of the average mass balance of 10 glaciers in Washington state's North Cascades showed that since 1984, they've had a cumulative loss of 43.5 feet in ice thickness. And areportfrom the World Glacier Monitoring Service—which compiles data from more than 30 countries representing more than 80 glaciers—found that 2015 was the 36th consecutive year without positive annual mass balances. That trend was expected to continue. Smaller glaciers mean less water. Worldwide, mountain glaciers and snowpacks contribute water used for drinking and irrigation formillions of people. Few communities rely on Glacier National Park's glaciers for drinking water, but wildlife certainly does. Fewer and smaller glaciers, as well as reduced winter snowpack, mean much less groundwater recharge and summer runoff, resulting in lower water levels in streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands during the growing season. That, in turn, reduces habitats in streams for invertebrates and fish. Less meltwater from glaciers also raises summer water temperatures, which could cause thelocal extinctionof temperature-sensitive aquatic species. The melting of the ice puts animals at risk in other ways as well. Climate change has direct impacts on the movement, migration, and habitats of wildlife. Mobile species with large geographic ranges and more generalist diets can tolerate wider ranges of climatic conditions and likely will better adapt to a changing climate. Ones limited to specific regions fare less well. David Benson, professor of biology at Marian University in Indianapolis, studies how white-tailed ptarmigan (below) around Logan Pass (above) deal with climate change. Every living organism has three options, he points out—move, adapt, or die—and the birds are using all three: Their territories in early summer and habitat in late summer have moved about 1000 feet farther up slope, their habitat preference has changed, and their numbers have dropped drastically. In the 1950s, the population at Logan Pass in late summer averaged 55 birds. By the late ‘90s, that average had dropped to 35, and in the past five years, to less than 15. Ptarmigan stay cool by hanging out near ice, water, and snow in late summer, and loss of glaciers plus smaller perennial snow packs in the park are forcing them to go farther up slope to find snow and ice. Climate change is also causing movement in the treeline around Logan Pass, which makes the area less suitable habitat for ptarmigan. ""Ptarmigan are the only bird that spends its entire life above the treeline and are very susceptible to heat,” Benson tells Mental Floss. ""Their means of getting away from heat is limited."" The birds will die within a few hours at high temperatures in the 80s. Other species are moving, too. Among them are meltwater stoneflies, a favorite food of black swifts and even bears. According to Daniel Fagre, a research ecologist at the Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, the bugs are endemic to cold water streams in the park and generally live in only the first few hundred yards of those fed by glaciers and snowmelt. They are experiencing ""elevational squeeze,"" or shrinking of available habitat between too-violent waterfalls and overly warm glacier ponds. Cutthroat trout require water below 67.3°F, typically found in lakes and streams just below glaciers. This species already suffers from habitat fragmentation and faces competition from and hybridization with rainbow trout—an invasive species. Cutthroat trout return to birth streams to breed, but hybrids lose that homing instinct and spread farther and farther from their original habitat. Recent monitoring indicates that hybrids also produce fewer offspring. In all waters west of the Continental Divide, Midvale Creek in the Two Medicine River drainage, and Wild Creek in the St. Mary River drainage, the national park allows only catch-and-release fishing for cutthroat trout. Warmer temperatures also increase the frequency of wildfires in the park; fire season in the northern Rockies now runs 78 days longer. Last year, the Sprague Fire southeast of Glacier’s Lake McDonald began on August 10 and continued to burn well into September, well past the time rain and snow would normally have extinguished the fire. Its smoke limited visibility at 6646-foot Logan Pass, as you can see in the photo above. The rising temperatures that are melting the glaciers are also leading to an increase in the black mountain pine beetle population, todamaging effect. The insects have always been in the park, but extremely cold winter days used to reduce the overwintering population of eggs and larvae. With fewer of those extremely cold days, pine beetle outbreaks have grown larger, Fagre says, resulting in more dead trees, which provide additional fuel for fires. It's also changing the distribution of plants. Open subalpine meadows around the Pass are experiencing invasion by small seedlings, mostly firs. Heavy snowpacks, which used to suppress these seedlings and keep them from being established, have been in decline. Open areas contain edible plants, so their loss affects wildlife such as deer, birds, bees, ground squirrels, marmots, and bears. The park's treeline has shifted upward in elevation, Fagre says, and climate change has already altered tree distribution and ranges in Glacier National Park. Subalpine tree species are encroaching into higher elevations. Changes in the type and distribution of plants affects animals that depend on them for food and shelter and other plants adapted for certain conditions, such as shade or lack thereof. A number of high-elevation plants depend on snow fields; the alpine poppy, for example, grows only downhill from a source of water such as a snowbank or glacier and could ultimately disappear as that habitat does. Melting ice also leads to fewer avalanches—which is a bad thing. Avalanches create disturbances important for the landscape, Fagre says, creating meadows up and down mountain faces, which are critical for foraging wildlife. Avalanches require snow as well as storm systems that set up weak layers, rain on snow events, or rapid warming to trigger them. Climate change affects each of these events and, therefore, the number and size of avalanches. Long-term loss of snowpack will mean fewer or no avalanches, leading to loss of the disturbance they cause and indirect effects from that on habitat and wildlife populations. In general, climate change is affecting interacting forces that have always been around, according to Fagre, and it often isn't clear how those will ultimately play out. ""We know some parts of this story well, other parts we can hazard guesses, and in others, we'll be surprised,"" he says. Those surprises likely won't be pleasant ones."
426,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/522346/see-how-power-plant-iceland-turns-carbon-emissions-stone,,"Iceland's Hellisheidi power plant, located about 15 miles outside Reykjavik, is one of the largest geothermal power plants in the world, producing energy for half of Iceland's population through superheated steam. ""Though it sounds like a very green source of energy, they're still emitting CO2,"" Martin Shute, a hydrologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, says in the video below. ""That is because CO2 and other gases are dissolved in the water that comes from the subsurface. It's in the steam that's being released into the atmosphere."" Though Hellisheidi emits only 5 percent of the CO2 produced by fossil fuel–powered plants, Iceland wants to make it even greener by returning the CO2 to where it came from—and keeping it there. CarbFix is a project founded in 2007 by Reykjavik Energy (which operates the plant through a subsidiary called On Power), the University of Iceland, France's National Center for Scientific Research, and Columbia University to advance the still-emerging technology of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Their innovative take on CCS involves injecting the emissions from the plant—a mix of CO2, hydrogen sulfide, and other gases—into layers of volcanic basalt rock nearly a mile underground. (Most CCS methods, asWirednotes, involve putting the CO2 in enormous underground reservoirs left behind after oil or gas has been pumped out.) The CO2 quickly reacts with the basalt, converts to carbonate, and is stored safely as a mineral underground. In onestudy, the researchers found that more than 95 percent of the CO2 mineralized to carbonate in less than two years. Learn more about this promising technology in the video below."

428,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/514179/what-gmo,,"If you've followed the debate about GMOs with any sort of regularity, there's a strong chance you've come across a picture of atomato stabbedby a giant syringe. That image, though a complete fiction, seems to perfectly capture what's preventing public acceptance of these foods: We don't really know what makes something a GMO. GMOs aren't made with syringes and, at the moment, they aren't even made with tomatoes, at least not commercially. But that false image is everywhere, and surveys indicateconsumers fear GMOswithout knowing much about them. So what exactly is a GMO? The initialism stands for ""genetically modified organism,"" but it's a term lacking scientific precision. Moreover, it's hard to find an organism in any way connected to humans thathasn'tbeen genetically modified, saysAlison Van Eenennaam, a geneticist at UC-Davis who specializes in animal biotechnology. ""I might argue that a great Dane or a Corgi are 'genetically modified' relative to their ancestor, the wolf,"" she tells Mental Floss. ""'GMO' is not a very useful term. Modifiedfor whatandwhyis really the more important question.” GMOs are often described as if they were a recent invention of our industrial food system, but genetic modification of food isn't new at all. It's been happening for many millennia: As long as farmers have been saving high-performing seeds for future harvests, we've had GMOs. Perhaps the earliest known example of a GMO is thesweet potato, which scientists believe became modified when wild sweet potatoes became infected, quite naturally, by a particular kind of soil bacteria. Realizing these sweet potatoes were edible, people began saving the seeds and cultivating them for future harvests. That was about 8000 years ago. These days, when people say ""GMO,"" they tend to mean one particular modification method that scientists refer to as transgenesis. As Van Eenennaam explains, transgenesis is ""a plant-breeding method whereby useful genetic variation is moved from one species to another using the methods of modern molecular biology, also known as genetic engineering."" Transgenic crops and animals have beenmodifiedwith the addition of one or more genes from another living organism, using either a ""gene gun,""Agrobacteria—a genus of naturally occurring bacteria that insert DNA into plants—or electricity, in a process called electroporation. The first commercial transgenic crops debuted in the early 1990s: a virus-resistant tobacco in China [PDF] and theFlavr-Savr tomatoin the U.S., which was genetically altered to not get ""squishy."" (It's no longer on the market.) As to the health risks of GMO foods, the scientific consensus is clear: Transgenic crops are no riskier than other crops. Van Eenennaam points to a 20-year history of safe use that includes ""thousands of studies, eleven National Academiesreports, and indeed [the consensus of] every major scientific society in the world."" Today, the most ubiquitous transgenic crops in the U.S. food system arecotton, soybeans, and corn, including those modified to resist the effects of the herbicide Roundup. Branded ""Roundup Ready,"" these crops have been modified so that farmers can apply the herbicide directly to crops to control weeds without killing the crops themselves. For farmers, the result was better weed control and higher yields. For critics of GMOs, these crops became their smoking gun. These opponents argue they're bad for the planet and bad for our health. There's no question that use ofglyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup, has increased since the introduction ofGMOs, but measuring its environmental impact is a far more complex equation. For example, as glyphosate use has increased, so hasthe prevalence of conservation tillage, a beneficial agricultural approach that helps sequester carbon in the soil and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Bt crops—transgenic crops modified with genes from the all-natural bacterial toxin Bt, short forBacillus thuringiensis—have also reduced the use of insecticide, according to a 2016 National Academies of Sciencereport. And thoughevidence suggestsherbicide use has increased since Roundup Ready GMOs were first commercialized in the U.S., herbicide use has increased amongst some non-GMO crops, too. Glyphosate also replacedmore toxic herbicideson the market and, if farmers were to stop using it, many would likelyreplace glyphosatewith another herbicide, possibly one that's more toxic. Glyphosate-resistant weeds are a problem, but banning glyphosate, or glyphosate-resistant GMOs for that matter, wouldn't solvethe problem. In recent years, opponents of GMOs have increasingly aimed their fire at glyphosate. The source of many of these claims is a 2015 assessment [PDF] by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to categorize glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic."" That categorization has been hotlycontestedby many scientists, asothergovernmentalagencieshave concluded glyphosate does not pose a carcinogenic hazard. And, in June,reporting revealedthat the lead researcher at IARC withheld important studies from the research group's consideration. Weighing criticisms of glyphosate against its benefits certainly brings up complex issues in our agricultural system, but ultimately these issues are not unique to GMOs nor would they magically disappear if transgenic technology were eliminated altogether. Most consumers probably can't name all the different methods of genetic modification, but there's a good chance they've eaten foods modified by one of these methods all the same.Layla Katiraee,a human molecular geneticist at Integrated DNA Technologies and a science communicator, has written aboutthese methodsto illustrate why it makes little sense to single out transgenic crops. Examples include polyploidy, which gave us the seedless watermelon, and mutagenesis, which scientists used to engineer a brightly colored grapefruit. As Katiraee points out, sometimes two different methods can even create a very similar end result. For example, the non-browning Opal apple was developed using traditional cross-breeding, while the non-browning Arctic apple uses transgenic methods to silence the genes that control browning. Katiraee says the most common objections to GMOs aren't exclusive to transgenic crops: “Don't like ‘Big Ag'? They use all methods ofcrop modification. Don't like herbicide-tolerant crops? They've been made with other methods. Don't like patents? Crops modified by all methods are patented. If you go through the list, you won't find one [objection] that applies exclusively to transgenesis.” Katiraee's arguments illustrate why it doesn't make sense to label transgenic crops ""GMO"" while omitting the non-browning opal apple or a seedless watermelon. And the non-GMO label can often bemisleading. Van Eenennaam points to one of the more ridiculous examples: non-GMO salt. ""Salt doesn't contain DNA, so salt cannot be genetically engineered,"" she says. ""All salt is 'non-GMO' salt."" The noisy GMO debate has often overshadowed the successes of lesser known, disease-resistant GMOs. Van Eenennaam argues that no one should object to these crops since protecting “plants and animals from disease aligns with most everyone's common interest in decreasing the use of chemicals in agricultural production systems, and minimizing the environmental footprint of food production."" Examples include ringspot virus–resistant papaya in Hawaii [PDF] and theAmerican chestnut, both rescued from the devastating effects of lethal plant viruses. Disease-resistant crops often face an uphill battle for approval. In Uganda, scientists developed adisease-resistant bananathat then faced difficult regulatory obstacles until a new law was finallyapprovedin October by the country's Parliament. In Florida, where the disease called citrus greening has caused widespreadcrop damageand loss to the citrus industry, orange trees have been modified with a spinach gene to help crops resist the virus. But orange juice manufacturers will have topersuade consumersto buy it. Scientists have used transgenic modification to address health concerns too. For example, some variations of the wilt-resistant banana also include a boost of vitamin A. Scientists are working on a form of wheat that would be safe for people withceliac disease. Van Eenennaam fears the controversy over GMOs has meant that, over the years, the public has missed out on important technologies. In the field of animal biotechnology, for example, animals have been produced that are resistant to disease, ""that produce less pollution in their manure, [and] that have … elevated levels of omega-3 fatty acids,"" but none of these have been commercialized in the U.S. Given that these crops and animals have a 20-year history of safe use, Van Eenennaam argues there's no reason that ""fungus-resistant strawberries, disease-resistant bananas, and virus-resistant animals [should] sit on the shelf"" unused.

429,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/519181/pine-vs-pvc-how-real-and-fake-christmas-trees-compare,,"Making the trek to a Christmas tree farm and picking out the perfect pine to brighten up your home is a cherished holiday tradition. Unless, of course, you belong to a family of artificial tree loyalists, in which case you may ring in the season by unloading plastic branches from the attic. The fake-versus-real tree debate has only gotten more heated in recent years. According to theNational Christmas Tree Association, the number of artificial trees purchased in the U.S. rose from 11.7 million in 2009 to 18.6 million in 2016. Real trees still outnumber fake ones, but they’re gradually becoming less popular: Only 27.4 million real Christmas trees were brought home in 2016 compared to 28.2 million in 2009. If you’re not committed to one tree over the other, choosing a camp to side with may feel overwhelming. But it doesn’t have to be that way: Here are some factors to consider when selecting the best tree to deck your halls. Cost is a top priority to many families picking out a Christmas tree. Both varieties of tree vary in price based on size, quality, and vendor. But while most real Christmas trees fall in the$25 to $100range, fake trees can get much more expensive. “There are literally hundreds of styles, brands, shapes, and sizes,” Jamie Warner, executive director of theAmerican Christmas Tree Association(not to be confused with the National Christmas Tree Association), tells Mental Floss. “The price can be anywhere from $25 into the thousands.” But even if you find a handsome real tree that’s cheaper than a fake one of similar size and quality, it’s not necessarily the better deal. One artificial tree can last you several seasons, making it cheaper than yearly trips to the tree farm in the long run. This may be the most controversial point in the great Christmas tree debate. Artificial trees, one side argues, are the more environmentally-friendly option because they can be used year after year. But according to real tree advocates, the carbon dioxide emitted during the production of one fake tree still outweighs the impact of several authentic ones. So what’s the smarter choice for tree-buyers who want to stay green? If you’re on Team Artificial Tree, aboutseven yearsis the length of time you need to own one before you can claim it was an earth-conscious purchase. Even then, some would argue that eventually dumping it in a landfill cancels that out. Real trees, on the other had, are easily recycled. Many towns process the discarded trees that are collected at the end of the holiday season and use the chips as mulch for public gardens, cushion for hiking trails, and even as fuel to supplement the energy grid. When trees aren’t mulched, they can bere-usedwhole as underwater habitats, flood barriers, and stimulation for zoo animals. There's also the issue of transportation. If the nearest Christmas tree farm is 40 minutes away while the closest department store is down the street, that adds to your carbon footprint. But according to Warner, there are better ways to be kind to the environment during the holiday season than stopping yourself from buying the tree you want. “If you really want to have an impact on your carbon footprint, try not driving for one day during the holidays,” he says. Sorry, fake Christmas tree fans: Nothing beats the smell of a fresh pine tree during the holidays. Of course, it is possible to replicate that festive aroma with scentedartificial sprigsandChristmas tree spray, but if smell is really that important to you, why not go with nature’s best air freshener? Of course, a house that reeks of authentic pine isn’t a plus for everyone. Some people may hate the scent, while others may have an allergic reaction to it. If that’s the case, an unscented plastic tree is the obvious choice. It may look pretty, but electric lights wrapped around 7 feet of kindling isn’t the safest combination to have in the house. The National Fire Protection Association reports that U.S. fire departments respond to about200 home firesthat start with Christmas trees per year. Of course, that number looks small compared to the millions of households with real trees that make it through each season accident-free. To ensure you belong to the latter group, don’t forget this golden holiday rule: There must be water in your tree’s baseat all times. Healthy, watered trees are less susceptible to flames, while dry trees are dangerously flammable. Synthetic trees are less likely to burn your house down because most are made with a fire-resistant material calledpolyvinyl chloride(PVC). But while rare, fake tree fires have beenknown to happen, often due to malfunctions in old, built-in electrical wiring. Cutting down, transporting, and decorating a tree may be an essential part of the holidays for some families, but for others it’s a hassle. If families have a tree waiting for them in storage, they may be less likely to wait until the last minute to put it up. The easiest artificial trees to set out open up umbrella-style and come with the lights built in. Other models require some assembly before they’re ready to decorate, but once you own one you can prepare it without ever leaving home. Artificial trees continue to be low-maintenance throughout the holiday season, while real trees need to have the water in their stands refreshedonce a day. Even after all that effort, owners are usually left with a mess of brown, dry needles by New Year's. Some municipalities will collect your old treefrom the curbin late December/early January, but there are places where you may be required to go out of your way to make sure the tree is disposed of properly. With fake trees, clean-up is as easy as wrapping it in a bag and storing it in a dry place. There’s no reason to hold Christmas trees to a single set of beauty standards. The trees, whether real or fake, come in different forms to satisfy different tastes. Over-achievers may choose the biggest fir on the farm, whileCharlie Brownfans may find something scrawnier endearing. On the artificial side, shoppers have even more options: There areupside downtrees, fiber-optic trees, and evenaluminum treesleft over from their heyday in the 1960s. Christmas trees are meant to be decorative, so pick whatever suits your unique style best. What’s the final word in the fake-tree-versus-real-tree saga? That whatever option you choose is between you and your family. So go ahead and buy the gaudiest, messiest, most high-maintenance tree you can find. If your feelings change, there’s always next year."
430,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/521651/top-10-science-stories-2017,,"Scientific breakthroughs of 2017 truly spanned a gamut, manifesting themselves in nearly every discipline—cosmology, biology, and anthropology, to name a few. They ranged from astonishing revelations about Jupiter's famous rings to discovering a new continent on our own planet. Human cellular and embryonic sciences were in the limelight: Researchers fixed a disease-causing gene in human embryos in one experiment and grew human cells in pig embryos in another. Here on Earth, scientists achieved the first ever teleportation (of a particle). Far away, cosmic forces forged an enormous amount of gold, literally of galactic proportions—200 times the mass of our planet. Here are the top 10 most notable science stories of 2017. We found not one butseven Earth-like planets, out of which three could potentially host life. Orbiting around a cool, dim star 39 light-years from us in the Trappist-1 system, these planets were detected through their eclipses—a brief dimming in their star's brightness when a planet passes in front of it. Although Trappist-1 looks more like Jupiter and its Galilean moons than our own solar system, its seven Earth-sized planets may have ""terrestrial"" conditions. Three of the planets are located in the habitable zone with their surface temperatures allowing for water oceans and an Earth-like atmosphere to form. So far, most planet-hunting efforts were focused on brighter stars and bigger planets. Trappist-1 is the first planetary system found to revolve around a smaller, dimmer star—and its discovery holds the potential to uncover many more exoplanets. Scientists have successfully used a gene-editing technique, CRISPR-Cas9,to clip outa mutated gene in human embryos, replacing it with a healthy copy. Called MYBPC3, the defective gene causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heart condition that can lead to sudden death in young people. While this was a stunning medical success, the CRISPR-Cas9 techniqueremains controversialamong doctors, ethicists, and sociologists, who are concerned that attempts to build a better human could lead to dismal medical and social outcomes. When the study was published, an international committee of genetics experts issued a statement advising against editing any embryo intended for implantation into future mothers. A different group of scientists managed toconvert CRISPRinto a fast, sensitive, and cheap diagnostic instrument for a range of diseases. Called SHERLOCK (for Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing), this method turns CRISPR into a tool that can sniff out specific genetic information, such as abnormal RNA. Surprisingly inexpensive, SHERLOCK can cost less than a buck per sample, and can hunt down the RNA of disease agents like dengue fever or Zika virus, and even search for mutations that can cause cancer. A giant piece of ice the size of Delawarebroke offthe Larsen ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, and is now adrift in the Weddell Sea. Weighting a trillion tons, it's one of the largest icebergs ever recorded. Over the last few decades, the Larsen ice shelf went through major changes. The sections called Larsen A and B collapsed in 1995 and 2002. More recently, a rift along the Larsen C section was detected, and it grew slowly over two years—until it washanging by a thread, and then finally split off. The scientists say that while climate change is responsible for melting sea ice around the world, this particular fracture may have been inevitable. Ice shelves naturally break up as they extend further out into the ocean. Neither will the massive iceberg cause a sea level rise as it melts—the same way ice cubes melting in your gin and tonic do not increase the volume of water in that glass. Purely the stuff of science fiction until now, teleportation became possible this year. Although not yet able to teleport an entire human, Chinese scientists said theymanaged to teleporta photon particlefrom the ground to a satellite 870 miles away. How does it work? Teleportation is transmitting the state of a thing rather than the thing itself. It's not unlike a fax machine, which sends information as various marks on a paper sheet rather than the sheet itself. If you combine this idea with the concept of quantum entanglement, in which two particles are created at the same time and place, so they effectively have the same existence, you can shoot one of the particles far away, but they will remain entangled—meaning if one changes, its remote twin will change too. So it's not aStar Trek–type of teleportation, where you can transfer objects or people from one place to another, but more like having a doppelganger tethered to you far away. Instead of sending marks on a paper sheet to a receiving-end fax machine, the Chinese scientists transmitted a bunch of photons. The team created 4000 pairs of quantum-entangled photons and fired one photon from each pair in a beam of light towards a satellite that can detect the quantum states of these single photons sent from the ground. So why all the excitement if we still can't teleport people? For one thing, quantum teleportation offers possibilities of creating un-hackable communications networks. Any attempts to eavesdrop on a quantum system or intercept the info being sent would cause detectable disturbances. You'd think Earth was completely mapped out by now, but this year, an international team of scientists discovered an entirely new continent down under. Called Zealandia, this eighth continentbroke off Australiamillions of years ago, containing New Zealand and New Caledonia, an island further up north. More than 90 percent of Zealandia is underwater, which is why it managed to evade geographers for so long. The team drilled cores4000 feet underwaterand gathered more than 8000 rock and sediment samples and several hundred fossils. They discovered microscopic remains of organisms that lived in warm, shallow seas as well as spores and pollen from terrestrial plants, revealing that in the past parts of Zealandia used to be above sea level. Besides their historical importance, these findings will help us understand the planet's future prospects. The fossilized records of Zealandia's past will provide more insight into the movement of Earth's tectonic plates and the global climate system, and contribute to the computer models used to predict future climate flukes. Using a new type of tomography that employs subatomic particles called muons, scientists generated 3D images of the ancient Egyptian pyramids, including the Great Pyramid of Giza, the biggest in Egypt. The images, generated as part of the ScanPyramids project, an international endeavor launched in 2015, revealed asurprising void, suggesting an inner structure. Despite being studied for more than a century, the Great Pyramid of Giza, built more than 4500 years ago as a burial place of pharaoh Khufu (a.k.a. Cheops), is still full of mysteries waiting to be discovered. Muons, which are byproducts of cosmic rays, pass through stones better than x-rays or other similar technology do, so they work very well for peeking inside the inaccessible ancient structures. According to the images, the void is at least 100 feet long and bears a structural resemblance to the section directly below it—the pyramid's Grand Gallery, a long area that feels like a ""very big cathedral at the center of the monument,"" as engineer and ScanPyramids co-founder Mehdi Tayoubi described it. The discovery marks the first time a new inner structure has been located in the pyramid since the 19th century. Researchers from the Salk Institute successfully managed to growhuman cells inside pig embryos. The goal was to better understand how to develop functional and transplantable tissue or organs. The project actually consisted of two parts. During the first part, researchers created a cross between a rat and a mouse by implanting rat cells into mouse embryos. During the second part, the team used the same technique with human cells and non-human animal hosts—such as cows or pigs, since their organs are closer in size to our own. The second feat was harder to achieve since people and pigs are further apart from each other than mice and rats are, and pig embryos develop faster than human ones. While the experiment was successful, the technology remains very controversial, as many experts fear it could potentially lead to human-animal chimeras. The Juno mission aimed at exploring Jupiter, which reached the target in 2016, proved that much of what we thought we knew about this planet iswrong. Turns out Jupiter's famous bands do not continue to the north and south poles. Instead, the poles are characterized by chaotic swirls and ovular features, which are Texas-sized ammonia cyclones. Ammonia, which emanates from Jupiter's great depths, plays a role in the planet's atmosphere and weather, but its levels vary greatly between different areas. Scientists still don't know whether Jupiter has a core, but they know that the pressure inside the gas giant is so strong that hydrogen, which normally is a gas, has been squeezed into a metallic fluid. The other mystery Juno may help shed some light on is Jupiter's magnetosphere, which generates spectacular auroras that are different in nature from Earth's Northern Lights. In September, scientistsdeliberately sacrificedthe Cassini spacecraft, which ran out of fuel after decades-long exploration of our other cosmic neighbor, Saturn. Launched in 1997 and reaching its target seven years later, Cassini tremendously expanded our knowledge about Saturn, its satellites, and our entire solar system. Thanks to Cassini, we assessed the composition of Saturn's rings and discovered that it has six moons. More interestingly, it expanded our assumptions about the habitable planets' range. We learned that a moon named Titan holds methane lakes, which could harbor a different form of life, and may have subsurface water oceans, possibly with hydrothermal vents akin to those in the Earth's undersea crusts. Now that Cassini's mission is over, all eyes are on Juno. Astronomers watched a never-before-witnessed cosmic phenomenon: two dead stars merging into one. It was a head-on collision of two neutron stars, which are superdense remains of previously exploded stars. As the two stars smashed into each other in a distant galaxy 130 million light-years from Earth, they emittedgravitational waveswhich began traveling outward like ripples on a pond. When the waves began theircosmic journey130 million years ago, Earth was still ruled by dinosaurs, and the complex equipment necessary to observe this phenomenon didn't exist. However, the existence of such waves was predicted by Einstein, so by the time they reached Earth, the scientists were ready with their detectors—two in the United States and one in Italy. Moments after the detectors noticed the waves, advanced space telescopes registered a high-energy light burst. Hours later, astronomers spotted a bright new point up in the sky, emitting infrared and ultraviolet light, followed by x-rays and radio waves days later. These observations informed scientists about a ""kilonova"" hypothesis, which postulates that neutron star collisions generate and spew out heavy elements like gold, silver, platinum, and uranium. The blast is believed to have created some200 Earth-masses of gold, scientists say. Until this year, modern humans were thought to have originated between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago, according to the oldest-known fossils ofHomo sapiensfound in Ethiopia. But recently unearthed remains of five earlyH. sapienswere dated at 300,000 years old, making our species100,000 years olderthan we thought. The new fossils were found in Morocco, on the other side of the African continent and further north than Ethiopia. Researchers now think that our ancestors may not have originated in any one specific spot in Africa, but rather evolved across the entire continent. Before the Sahara became a desert, it sprouted forests and plains, making it possible for early humans to travel across the continent. The early hominids were likely following and hunting herds of gazelles or other animals, evolving new cognitive skills along the way, which enabled them to create more complex tools and develop advanced social behaviors. So as they spread across Africa, these early humans acquired the very traits that later came to define our species."

But if a new start-up has its way, we might soon be gazing up at 12-story buildings made almost entirely out of Douglas firs. In a report forCityLab, journalist Amanda Kolson Hurley profiled Portland, Oregon's Lever Architecture, a firm attempting to revitalize wood-based towers that reduce the carbon footprints of conventional buildings. Their offices are located in a four-story property made from wood; their next major project, titled Framework, is expected to be 12 stories and slated to debut in Portland in 2019. Part of Lever’s goal is to reduce concerns over wooden structures—namely, that they’re prone to fire hazards or might not be structurally sound in an earthquake. Developers use a building material called mass timber, aspecial typeof strengthened wood in which timber panels are glued together to make beams and cross-set layers for walls and floors. Fire tests have shown the mass timber doesn’t ignite easily: It chars, which can insulate the rest of the panel from the heat. Strength testing has shown the layers aren’t easily jostled by outside forces. Lever’s architects hope that wooden buildings will lessen the environmental impact of commercial towers that use concrete and steel, which are responsible for 10 percent of greenhouse gas emissions during their manufacturing. Other firms have designs on taller buildings, including one 35-story tower in Paris and a 24-story building in Vienna. [h/tCityLab]"
432,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/504600/londons-sewage-blocking-fatbergs-are-going-be-turned-biodiesel,,"UK officials can't exactly transform the Whitechapel fatberg—a 143-ton trash mass lurking in London's sewer system—into treasure, but they can turn it into fuel.AsThe Guardianreports, Scottish biodiesel producer Argent Energy plans to convert parts of the noxious blockage into an environmentally friendly energy source. For the uninitiated, fatbergs (which get their names from a portmanteau of ""fat"" and ""icebergs"") are giant, solid blobs of congealed fat, oil, grease, wet wipes, and sanitary products. They form in sewers when people dump cooking byproducts down drains, or in oceans when ships release waste products like palm oil. These sticky substances combine with floating litter to form what could be described as garbage heaps on steroids. Fatbergs wash up on beaches, muck up city infrastructures, and are sometimes even removedwith cranesfrom sewer pipes as a last resort. Few—if any—fatbergs, however, appear to be as potentially lethal as the one workers recently discovered under London's Whitechapel neighborhood. In a news release, private utility company Thames Waterdescribedthe toxic mass as ""one of the largest ever found, with the extreme rock-solid mass of wet wipes, nappies, fat and oil weighing the same as 11 double-decker buses."" Ick factor aside, the Whitechapel fatberg currently blocks a stretch of Victorian sewer more than twice the length of two fields from London's Wembley Stadium. Engineers with jet hoses are working seven days a week to break up the fatberg before sucking it out with tankers. But even with high-pressure streams, the job is still akin to ""trying to break up concrete,"" says Matt Rimmer, Thames Water's head of waste networks. The project is slated to end in October. But instead of simply disposing of the Whitechapel fatberg, officials want to make use of it. Argent Energy—which has in the past relied on sources like rancid mayonnaise and old soup stock—plans to process fatberg sludge into more than 2600 gallons of biodiesel, creating ""enough environmentally friendly energy to power 350 double-decker Routemaster buses for a day,""according toThames Water. ""Even though they are our worst enemy, and we want them dead completely, bringing fatbergs back to life when we do find them in the form of biodiesel is a far better solution for everyone,"" said company official Alex Saunders. In addition to powering buses, the Whitechapel fatberg may also become an unlikely cultural touchstone: The Museum of London is working with Thames Water to acquire a chunk of the fatberg,according to BBC News. The waste exhibit will represent just one of the many challenges facing cities, and remind visitors that they are ultimately responsible for the fatberg phenomenon. ""When it comes to preventing fatbergs, everyone has a role to play,"" Rimmer says. ""Yes, a lot of the fat comes from food outlets, but the wipes and sanitary items are far more likely to be from domestic properties. The sewers are not an abyss for household rubbish.""

The chain is also a culinary giant, serving, among other Swedish delicacies,millions of meatballseach day. Food is such a large part of the brand that IKEA is now funneling resources into reducing waste in its cafes,Fast Companyreports. The plan is to cut food waste in IKEA’s restaurants and smaller bistros in half by the year 2020. To do this, the company has already implemented some innovative technology in many of its locations. As of May 2017, approximately 20 percent of all IKEA stores had added trash bins with specially-designed digital scales beneath them for measuring tossed food. After throwing away items, like old salmon or surplus cinnamon buns, employees use the touch-screen above the bin to document exactly what went into it. The screen responds with statistics about the food’s cost and its contribution to IKEA’s carbon footprint. As staff members use the system, it collects data that will eventually be used by the restaurants to modify their production practices. Seeing that waste peaks at certain times of day, for example, lets IKEA workers know they should be preparing less food during that timeframe. And if one type of food is more likely to end up in the trash can than others, they may respond by ordering less of it. Another consequence of the system may be preventing food waste that was never necessary in the first place. The United States wastes about40 percentof its food each year, and a lot of that product is salvageable. By engaging with its employees every time they chuck something into the garbage, IKEA is forcing them to think about the larger impact that food waste creates. The digital scales have already saved 80,000 pounds of food, or about $1 million. The chain is now installing them in all 400 of its stores across the globe. The initiative is the latest step in IKEA’s march toward making food a more central part of its business. Within the past year alone, IKEA has launched acookbook-inspiredmarketing campaign and teased the possibility of somestandalone cafes. [h/tFast Company]"
434,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/504487/ghostly-love-story-haunted-father-us-forest-conservation,,"Laura Houghteling was terminally ill with tuberculosis when she met Gifford Pinchot, the man who would marry her after she died. The bright and beautiful daughter of a rich Chicago merchant passed away before the age of 30, but Pinchot remained faithful to her for decades, relying on the support of her love from the afterlife as he crusaded for the conservation of America's natural resources. The only thing Gifford loved as much as Laura was nature itself. Born in 1865, he was the oldest son of wallpaper merchant James Pinchot and Mary Pinchot née Eno, the daughter of Manhattan real estate baron Amos Eno and sister to traffic safety innovatorWilliam Phelps Eno. Gifford—6-foot-2 with a robust mustache—was voted the handsomest man in his graduating class at Yale. In 1891, he was hired to manage the forests surrounding the construction of George Vanderbilt's Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina, America's largest privately owned home. Asheville's hot springs and lush scenery were attractive to wealthy families across America, and the Houghteling family bought Strawberry Hill, a property adjacent to the Biltmore, in 1890. Laura was 26 in 1891, the year they moved in—several years past the age when she would have been expected to wed. Her single status wasn't because of her personality, which was, as herAsheville Daily Citizenobituary would put it, ""lovely in every trait of character."" Her beauty equaled Gifford's; she had long blonde hair and a soft, kind face with large light eyes. She was unwed because of her health. As members of the upper-class social circuit, the pair had known each othercasually for years. Yet their first meeting in North Carolina, at a luncheon, was very formal; they called each other Miss Houghteling and Mister Pinchot. In his diary years later, Gifford remembered blushing when he first called her Laura. The relationship became intense, conducted over picnics, horseback rides along the French Broad River, and a few stolen passionate embraces. Both remained hopeful that she would recover and thrive, but they also took solace in religion and their shared interpretation of the afterlife. Their faith posited the physical body as a sort of clothing for the spirit, unnecessary to life itself. The couple read metaphysical works together, including the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson (who also wed a woman dying of tuberculosis), Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, and the Spiritualist novels of early feminist author Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward. Both believed that to be dead was to be one with God, and that their lover could share in that communion from Earth. On New Year’s Day 1894, the reluctant families finally gave their blessing for the couple to be married. Laura had just moved from her beloved Strawberry Hill home to Washington, D.C. for new medical care, but the treatments were in vain. She died on February 7, 1894—before the pair could be married in any kind of official way. Gifford accompanied the Houghtelings to her burial in Chicago, and then went straight back to work. Thirty-eight days after her death, Gifford recorded in his diary: ""My lady is very near."" Soon his entries were a chronicle of ""my darling"" and the ""presence and peace"" she brought him. He came to think of her last dwelling in D.C. as ""our house,"" and took to standing outside of the building, even after it was sold to someone else. He wore black for two years, but sometime in 1896, he stopped wearing mourning clothes and began to consider himself married. He usually wrote about Laura in his diaries in the present tense. Some days he wrote in code, using the language of weather to describe his visions of love; a ""bright"" or ""clear"" day when he felt her with him, a ""cloudy"" or ""blind"" day when he did not. Other days he just said, ""To our house with my Laura."" He talked to Laura, reading books with her, traveling with her—at least, with her spirit. Gifford was not just unloading his problems to her and dreaming of her, but felt he was taking advice from her on his speeches, ideas, and political plans. Occasionally she even rebuked him, as when he read a book ""My Lady did not approve of"" and he felt filled with regret. When he sensed her presence grow distant, he discreetly consulted a medium. The convenience of a spirit who was with him always—rather than a woman with actual needs—was something of an asset as Gifford climbed the ladder in his career. When he faced professional challenges, he sometimes relied on Laura's support. Reflecting on an 1896 speech in Philadelphia, he wrote, ""I spoke as My Lady's servant."" As the first chief of theU.S. Forest Service(and before that, chief of the Department of Agriculture’s Division of Forestry), he shaped the institution into a force to be reckoned with, training the foresters who would eventually be called ""Little GPs"" after his initials. Teddy Roosevelt entered Gifford's life in 1899, when the then-governor of New York invited the forester to his house. There, Gifford bested him in a pre-dinner boxing match. The pair shared a number of qualities: a love of the outdoors, a belief in conservation, and a knowledge of tragedy; Roosevelt had lost his wife and his mother on the same day in 1884, a pain he still carried into the new century. Teddy and Gifford fought a hostile Congress and powerful industrialists to preserve and protect hundreds of millions of acres of land from the corporate entities that had already ravaged Eastern forests. Because of Roosevelt and Pinchot, the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and the Petrified Forest are preserved for the enjoyment of citizens today. Pinchot's single status was a hot topic among D.C. social circles, where he was once called the town's ""most eligible bachelor."" He had stayed in top physical condition and was a regular churchgoer, but it was all for Laura. Self-restraint was key to both of their upbringings, and while you can't prove a negative, he was probably completely celibate until well after Roosevelt left office. And Laura was still with him, in their way. After testifying before a Senate committee as Chief Forester in 1906, he wrote, ""I felt today my Lady's help."" After Roosevelt left office, Laura was less and less clear to him, and the ailing Mary Pinchot sensed an opportunity to see her favorite son married to a living woman. After several persistent proposals, he married Cornelia Bryce on August 15, 1914, just nine days before Mary's death. The marriage was a match on many levels: their political values and ambitions (Cornelia was nationally known for her feminism, and Pinchot became the vice-president of a Men for Suffrage organization); their wealthy families; and their status as older newlyweds, Pinchot being 49 and Cornelia being 33. They had one child, Gifford Bryce Pinchot, and the marriage lasted 32 years, during which Pinchot served two terms as governor of Pennsylvania. Swedenborg wrote that true spouses spend eternity together, but that temporary human marriages are sometimes necessary when one's time on Earth lasts longer than their true spouse's. After his human marriage, Gifford kept all of Laura's letters and his diaries in a blue Tiffany box ordered a month after her death. But he never wrote of her again. His last reference to her was 14 days before his wedding; it was ""not a clear day.""

435,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/502127/383-million-plan-save-californias-artificial-desert-sea,,"Picture a beach next to a blue lake under the bright California skies, its water twinkling as the sun catches gentle waves, and birds cruising on the thermals above. As you walk towards the lake, you see that the water levels are low, leaving behind cracked and dry brown mud below the white beach. When you reach what looks like sand from afar, your feet make a crunching sound. You realize it's thousands—no, millions—of bones snapping beneath your sneakers, from fish that were washed ashore, too many for even the birds or wild animals to consume. Wind blows toxic dust into the air from the shoreline, a sulphury smell rises up from the lake, and you realize why the shore is littered with rusted, broken, abandoned structures, and the only human here is you. But if you squint, you could see what it once was—and what it could be again. This is the Salton Sea. In December, it will receive its final water transfer from the Colorado River, its only lifeline. After that, it will begin to dry up. Left to its own devices, it would disappear completely. But the state of California plans to help it survive: It's investing $383 million over the next decade to save the Salton Sea—in much reduced form. This fake lake was created by accident, is heavily polluted, and can't survive on its own. Why bother to save this strange place? Because not saving it would be even worse.  Located southeast of Los Angelesand directly south of Joshua Tree National Park, the sea is an artificial replacement of an ancient natural lake called Cahuilla. The lake appeared and disappeared over the millennia at intervals of 400 or 500 years depending on how much water it received from the Colorado River, writes George Kennan in his 1917 bookThe Salton Sea; an account of Harriman's fight with the Colorado River. The native Cahuilla Indians told Kennan that the lake, located 232 feet below sea level, would periodically fill with water, turning the region into a useful wetland. At its fullest, it covered 2000 square miles and was 300 feet deep. But then it would slowly evaporate in the burning desert sun, its waning waters too salinated by naturally concentrated salts in the landscape to be of use to the Cahuilla. From at least 1540 to 1905, it was completely dry, as many weary '49ers, headed to California during the Gold Rush, couldattest. In 1900, the California Development Company, bankrolled by Harriman's railroad, brought irrigation to the desert. It diverted the Colorado River's water to the Imperial Valley, which sits directly south of the Salton Sea near the U.S.-Mexico border. It was a bold, impetuous move—and one that paid off. Irrigation canals turned the desert fertile by providing water for farmers. ""If anyone had then ventured to predict that this dried-up bed of the Gulf of California, this hot, sterile, and apparently irreclaimable desert would eventually become a beautiful, cultivated valley, producing cotton, barley, alfalfa, dates, melons, and fruit, to the value of 10 or 15 million dollars a year, he would have been regarded as a visionary enthusiast, if not a desert-crazed monomaniac,"" Kennan writes. Everything changed in 1905. An extra-snowy winter caused massive snow melt in the spring, and the Colorado River swelled, overwhelming the irrigation channels. Engineers spent months attempting—and failing—to hold the river back by building dikes and bringing in truckloads of earth to dam it. By the time they quelled the flood, a huge amount of water had already flowed into the basin of Lake Cahuilla. This was the birth of the Salton Sea. In ensuing decades, the sea only grew larger thanks to agricultural runoff, which also deposited salts, minerals, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers in the seabed. Some saw tourism potential in the rising waters, stocking the sea with tilapia and building resorts, restaurants, and homes along the coastline. Just a few hours' drive from Hollywood, the sea was advertised as a ""paradise in the desert"" or a working-man's Palm Springs. Small towns popped up on its shores: Bombay Beach. Salton Sea Beach.Desert Shores. In the 1950s, it became a playground for the growing California middle class. Stars like the Beach Boys and Sonny Bono especially loved it; the latter became its champion. After Bono's death in 1998, his widow, Mary,told CNNthat he had ""wanted his legacy to be saving the Salton Sea."" A national wildlife refuge in the area is nownamed after him. But the heyday of the Salton Sea didn't last long. As the populations of western states grew, they needed water—not just for crops but for homes, lawns, golf courses, hospitals, and industries. And for that water, they turned to the 1450-mile-long Colorado River, which passes through seven U.S. states and two in Mexico. Forty million people depend on the Colorado. Over the decades, so much water has been siphoned from the river that in most years, it no longer flows to the Gulf of California, as it did for millions of years (with a brief pause, geologically speaking, to create Lake Cahuilla). Considering these pressures, the Salton Sea is a low priority. Its receding shores have left behind ghost towns, dead trees, toxic dust, and rotting fish.  The decision to cut off the Salton Seafrom the Colorado River comes out of a2003 dealbetween southern California water authorities and various parties, following an earlier lawsuit; for years, states have been grappling over water allotments from the Colorado River, and California has long been accused by other states of taking more than its fair share. That deal allowed for water for the Salton through 2017. When the last water transfer of 38 billion gallons goes through in December, the Salton will dry up faster than ever. There are three reasons why this is a problem. First, as the lake bed becomes exposed, the fine particulates in the mud there will be blown into the already dusty skies of Imperial County. Since so much of the water that made up the lake came from agricultural runoff, that dust likely contains accumulated pesticides, DDT, and heavy metals. (The extent of the contamination is still not known, and researchers are just beginning to look at what's in the dust.) ""Those [exposed areas] are creating far more dust than the regular residential desert,"" Salton City resident Kerry Morrison tells Mental Floss. Morrison is the executive director of EcoMedia Compass, a nonprofit environmental organization, and president of the West Shores Chamber of Commerce, which represents several Salton Sea communities. ""During dust storms, I've been down there [by the shore]. It's major,"" he says. The dust is wrecking people's lungs. Residents of Imperial County have an asthma rate three times higher than the state average, and the county now has California's highest rate of asthma-associated ER visits. ""It is a crisis. It's an emergency. It needs to be dealt with,"" Luis Olmedo, executive director of theComité Cívico Del Valle, an outreach and educational organization in the Imperial Valley,toldThe Desert Sun. That crisis, like many of those exacerbated by climate change, is borne by those with the fewest resources. ""This is an economic justice issue. The people affected are poor disadvantaged Hispanic communities,"" Michael Cohen, a senior associate at the water-focused environmental nonprofit Pacific Institute, tells Mental Floss. In a recent study, Pacific Institute estimates that the exposed lake bed could put an additional 100 tons of dust into the air per day through 2045, leading to an estimated cost of almost $40 billion in healthcare due to asthma, lung cancer, and heart disease, which are worsened by air pollution. Economically, the communities along the Sea are also in decline. The area used to compete with Yosemite for visitors, often besting the National Park for tourists. ""We've lost half of our businesses in 10 years,"" Morrison says. ""That's not a future to believe in."" But locals think it could still be an economic driver again, albeit a more modest one, if the Sea were returned to even a version of its former glory. Birds also love the ""stinky sea"": In the 112 years it has been with us, the Salton has become a major stopover for birds on the Pacific Flyway, which runs from Alaska to Patagonia. But the water becomes more saline as levels drop, and fish die. And without fish, the birds who have come to depend on the area die too. In the past, they would have had plenty of other options when Lake Cahuilla dried up, but California, like many states, has bulldozed, filled in, or developed most of its natural wetland areas—about 95 percent of them. There aren't other nearby waters for tired birds as they fly thousands of miles along their migration routes. The Salton Sea might be a smelly, salty lake to us, but to the more than 420 species of birds observed there, it's an oasis, as Audubon Californianotes.  But not all hope is lost for the Salton Sea.There is a10-year planfrom the state of California that is gearing up as the imminent cutoff of the lake from the Colorado River looms. The plan allocates $383 million over a decade (with an initial $80 million in funding already available) to deal with all three issues: dust, birds, and the local economy. Under this plan, a little more than half of the Salton Sea will remain, surrounded by interconnected ponds, some as large as 500 acres. Each pond will be engineered, with berms to keep water inside and culverts connecting them. They'll be deep enough for fish to reproduce within. According to Bruce Wilcox, assistant secretary of Salton Sea policy at the state agency California Natural Resources, ""The new plan builds habitat in an incremental manner as the sea recedes. It provides a less saline habitat—that helps with the fisheries habitat and the fish-eating birds. It also covers up the exposed playa—that helps with the dust issue."" Over the 10-year period, about 40,000 acres of playa—flat, dried-out desert basin that water easily evaporates from—will be covered by water. That's about two-thirds of the area that's projected to become exposed as the Salton Sea dries up. A healthier and more pleasant sea will be better for the locals and might encourage visitors, Wilcox tells Mental Floss: ""It'll look different to people, but I don't think the birds will care."" This fall, California State Resources began digging out the playa to create the first ponds. Whatever the agency learns can be used to make the future ponds as effective as possible. Morrison calls the 10-year-plan ""a good start"" that provides an ""ark for the animals and gives them a chance."" But he says it's not enough, especially because it's not going to improve air quality to the level it needs. He points out that there's no real plan for dust mitigation where people live. He'd like to see some of the almost $400 million spent on bringing water into the Salton Sea—actual salt water from the Gulf of California. Since the 1970s, some locals have advocated for constructing a 115-mile, border-crossing channel called the Coyote Canal. Part of the canal, covering about one-third of the distance, already exists, serving ranches and farms in Mexico. Under this plan, the canal would be extended from the gulf to a small semi-dry lake called Laguna Salada, and then continue another 40 miles north to the Salton Sea. Because the sea is so far below sea level, the canal would have a downhill run. The plan's advocates see it as an opportunity to restore the Salton Sea to its former glory. Construction cost estimates vary, but Morrison argues they are similar to what is already being spent. Continuing the canal would involve the Mexican government, ranchers, and farmers whose land would be crossed, but Morrison says both the government and the ranchitos are enthusiastic. Having a water source—even a salty one—would be a boon for the region, including for the nativeCocopah peoplewhose culture was focused around the lower Colorado, on both sides of the Mexican border, for 4000 years. Currently, Americans use all the water before it reaches the Mexican border and the Cocopah's land. You can see how its proponents envision it working in the video below. Morrison also points out that existing geothermal plants on the shores of the Salton Sea could use excess energy to desalinate the seawater, making a true oasis in the desert—complete with fresh water. There's already an experimental program, run bySephton Geothermal, that does just that, and there are proposals for adding another geothermal plant to those that already exist there. Both the canal construction and the desalination program were once included in a more ambitious—and more expensive—restoration plan for the Salton Sea area, but neither made it into the current plan. But geoengineering is harder than nature makes it look. One cautionary tale is the Aral Sea, which straddles the border between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Once the fourth-largest lake in the world, it's now a ghost of its former self. For decades during the Soviet era, the rivers that fed it were diverted and dammed for agriculture. It's now ""a memory of those who knew it and loved it and saw it slip away,"" Michael Edelstein writes in hisbookDisaster by Design: The Aral Sea and Its Lessons for Sustainability. Owens Lake is another, more local example. The 200-square-mile lake, which had existed for 800,000 years at the foot of the Sierras, was sucked dry by thirsty Los Angelenos in a little more than a decade. By 1926, it was mostly gone. Dust became a problem there, too. A billion dollars later, most of the carcinogenic dust has been mitigated with engineering projects similar to those planned for the Salton Sea. But Owens Lake, once called the American Switzerland, isgone forever. Will the Salton Sea go the way of the Aral Sea or Owens Lake? Or will the 10-year rescue plan lead to a success story? As construction begins on the ponds, one thing is for sure: The Salton Sea as we have known it will be gone. ""We are looking at a smaller, but more sustainable Salton Sea,"" Wilcox says. ""It will have a smaller footprint, but it's something we can sustain over time."" Editor's note: This story has been updated."

Richard Eckersley opened the market with his wife Nicola after making a name for himself in a very different line of work. Eckersley is best known from his days as a professional soccer player forManchester United, but he was recently inspired to shift his career focus toward helping the planet. “Every time you make a purchase, you cast a vote for the kind of world you wish to live in,” Richard and Nicola write on the business's website. “We want that world to be sustainable, clean, and thriving for our future generations to enjoy.” Earth.Food.Love was conceived with those future generations in mind—including Richard and Nicola’s 15-month-old daughter Willow. The shop’s all-organic inventory is divided into bins and jars that customers can access by lifting lids or turning spigots. In the dried goods section they’ll find nuts, cereals, beans, spices, chocolates, and baking ingredients. The store even sells liquids by the milliliter, like vinegars and syrups. To take some home, shoppers can bring their own containers or purchase one of the pots sold on-site. After stocking up on groceries they can move on to the toiletry selections, which include package-free toothbrushes and toothpaste.

Wildlife smugglers in Africa are increasingly evading the law by disguising illegally harvested rhinoceros horns as wearable baubles and trinkets, according to anew studyconducted by wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC. As BBC News reports, TRAFFIC analyzed 456 wildlife seizure records—recorded between 2010 and June 2017—to trace illegal rhino horn trade routes and identify smuggling methods. In a report, the organization noted that criminals have disguised rhino horns in the past using all kinds of creative methods, including covering the parts with aluminum foil, coating them in wax, or smearing them with toothpaste or shampoo to mask the scent of decay. But as recent seizures in South Africa suggest, Chinese trafficking networks within the nation are now concealing the coveted product by shaping horns into beads, disks, bangles, necklaces, and other objects, like bowls and cups. The protrusions are also ground into powder and stored in bags along with horn bits and shavings.

""Because if someone's walking through the airport wearing a necklace made of rhino horn, who is going to stop them? Police are looking for a piece of horn and whole horns."" Rhino horn is a hot commodity in Asia. The keratin parts have traditionally been ground up and used to make medicines for illnesses like rheumatism or cancer, although there's no scientific evidence that these treatments work. And in recent years, horn objects have become status symbols among wealthy men in countries like Vietnam. ""A large number of people prefer the powder, but there are those who use it for lucky charms,” Melville Saayman, a professor at South Africa's North-West University who studies the rhino horn trade,told ABC News. “So they would like a piece of the horn."" According to TRAFFIC, at least 1249 rhino horns—together weighing more than five tons—were seized globally between 2010 and June 2017. The majority of these rhino horn shipments originated in southern Africa, with the greatest demand coming from Vietnam and China. The product is mostly smuggled by air, but routes change and shift depending on border controls and law enforcement resources. Conservationists warn that this booming illegal trade has led to a precipitous decline in Africa's rhinoceros population: At least 7100 of the nation's rhinos have been killed over the past decade, according to one estimate, and only around 25,000 remain today. Meanwhile, Save the Rhino International, a UK-based conservation charity, told BBC News that if current poaching trends continue, rhinos could go extinct in the wild within the next 10 years.

Over the years, people living in the United States have been exposed to considerably fewer contaminants such as lead and carbon monoxide. But as a new study in theLancetmedical journal points out, pollution continues to be a global crisis, and one that might carry a far more devastating mortality rate than previously believed. Analyzing the complete picture of contaminated regions around the globe, study authors believe pollution killed 9 million people in 2015—more than smoking, AIDS, war, or deaths from hunger. The study’s authors aggregated premature deaths on a global basis that were attributable to pollution, singling out certain regions that continue to struggle with high concentrations of toxic materials. In India, one in four premature deaths (2.5 million) was related to environmental contamination. In China, 1.8 million people died due to illnesses connected to poor air quality. A lack of regulatory oversight in these areas is largely to blame. Dirty fossil fuels, crop burning, and burning garbage plague India; industrial growth in other locations often leads to pollution that isn’t being monitored or controlled. Roughly 92 percent of deaths as a result of poor environmental conditions are in low- or middle-income countries [PDF]. The study also notes that the 9 million estimate is conservative and likely to rise as new methods of connecting pollution-related illness with mortality in a given area are discovered. It’s hoped that increased awareness of the problem and highlighting the economic benefits of a healthier population (lower health care costs, for one) will encourage governments to take proactive measures.

A cigarette buttinthe pavement, though—well, that's another story. Scientistswritingin the journalConstruction and Building Materialssay butt-studded asphalt could be the wave of the future. Tobacco companies produce about 6 trillion cigarettes every year, which leads to about 1.3 million tons of butts. Lead author Abbas Mohajerani is an engineer at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. ""In Australia alone, people smoke about 25 to 30 billion filtered cigarettes a year and, of these, about 7 billion are littered,"" hesaidin a statement. Butts that end up in a landfill are not much better off. They're slow to decompose, and when they do, they release their nasty chemicals into the soil and water around them. Mohajerani knows that we're not going to get everyone on Earth to stop smoking. But there may be other things we can do. He and his colleagues at RMIT have begun incorporating cigarette butts into different construction materials. They started with bricks. And while it may sound like a weird, abstract art project, the addition of cigarette butts actually makes a lot of sense. The very thing that makes cigarettes disposable—their flammability—also can help make better, cheaper bricks. The researchersfoundthat changing a brick's composition to include just 1 percent cigarette waste reduced the amount of energy required to fire that brick by a whopping 58 percent. The waste-added bricks also were better at insulating than standard bricks—which could reduce a brick building's heating and cooling costs. For their latest study, the team sealed cigarette butts in bitumen and paraffin wax, then combined them with hot asphalt. The resulting pavement was not only functional but, like the bricks, better for the surrounding environment. The inclusion of the bitumen decreased the pavement's ability to conduct heat, which could help keep already overheated cities cooler. Most importantly, both the bricks and the asphalt imprisoned the cigarettes' toxic chemicals and prevented them from poisoning their surroundings.

441,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/504985/grass-fed-beef-actually-worse-planet-report-finds,,"There are plenty of reasons to reject factory farming, but in the case of beef, your carbon footprint shouldn’t be one of them. According toEcoWatch, new research shows that grazed cattle provide an outsized contribution to greenhouse gasses, as opposed to cattle kept largely indoors and fed on grain. The report [PDF], released by Oxford’sFood Climate Research Network, aims to provide definitive answers to what has been a heavily debated topic in environmental circles. Someresearchhas found that grazing cattle actually reduces the carbon footprints of beef operations, because all that pasture stores carbon and prevents it from being released into the atmosphere, and because all that chomping stimulates new vegetation growth. Other research hasfoundthat the benefits aren’t as great as the grass-fed boosters estimate—especially since the fields of grain used to grow cattle feed for factory farms sequester carbon, too. The new Oxford research comes down firmly on the side of the latter camp. It finds that while grass-fed operations can help sequester carbon, it’s “only under very specific conditions,” in part since the definition of what a grassland is can vary wildly. There are natural ranges dominated by wild vegetation, there are pastures that are actively maintained and managed by farmers, and there is land that lies somewhere in between. Overgrazing, trampling, and soil conditions can all negatively impact how much carbon the grasses can sequester. And even under the best conditions, the gains can be short-lived. “This sequestering of carbon is even then small, time-limited, reversible, and substantially outweighed by the greenhouse gas emissions these grazing animals generate,”accordingto FCRN. And it seems that even if the vegetationdoessequester carbon, grass-fed beef is still an outsized source of greenhouse gasses. To begin with, all cattle are a huge drain on the environment, no matter how you feed them. The report estimates that the livestock supply chain generates around 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and cattle create 65 percent of those livestock emissions. But even compared to cattle in general, grass-fed animals are heavy polluters. Within the global protein supply, grass-fed beef makes up around 1 gram of protein per person, per day, compared to 13 grams from all ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, etc.). But these grazed cattle generate up to a third of all global greenhouse emissions from ruminants. In other words, grass-eating cattle create an outsized cost—emissions-wise—compared to the meat they provide. And the carbon sequestration doesn't help enough to offset that. The report estimates that the carbon sequestration that might occur from grazing practices would only offset emissions by 20 percent. There are other reasons to buy grass-fed beef, of course, whether it’s about ethical concerns with factory farming or just a taste preference. But if you’re going to choose grass-fed, your reason shouldn’t be concern for the environment. [h/tEcoWatch]"

About 30 years earlier, the company had begun making an organic chemical called acetaldehyde, using mercury as a catalyst to trigger the needed reactions. Afterwards, the company dumped the leftover chemicals into Minamata Bay, where the mercury came into contact with bacteria that transformed it into the most noxious form of the metal: methylmercury. This toxic substance was absorbed by plants, which were in turn eaten by fish. Eventually, the methylmercury made its way up the food chain and poisoned both felines and humans. Birth defects became rampant, and more than 900 people died. Thousands of victims have since beenidentified.

Now, he's finally found it. Tyrone reports the existence of a new (to science) species they've namedUromys vikain a study just published in theJournal of Mammalogy. It's the first new rodent found in the Solomon Islands in 80 years—""and it's not like people haven't been trying,"" as Lavery says in apress statementfrom The Field Museum. ""It was just so hard to find."" The Solomon Islands, located just east of Papua New Guinea, are biologically isolated by the Pacific Ocean, and half the mammals native to the islands are found nowhere else. The unique nature of their ecosystem makes the Solomon Islands—much like the Galapagos—fertile ground for scientists. Though researchers working in the Solomon Islands have suspected the existence of the vika for two decades, the rat found by Lavery and his colleagues John Vendi and Hikuna Judge is the first specimen recorded by scientists. They spotted it scurrying out of a felled tree, and judging by the shape of its skull, could tell that it wasn't like other species of rats native to the area. Before its discovery, Lavery had spent so long looking for the elusive rat that he was beginning to think that maybe the children's rhymes and folk songs referencing vika were just referring to regular black rats. But his first instinct was correct.U. vikais more than four times the size of a regular rat, measuring about 18 inches long. It lives in trees, and its teeth are strong enough to crack into coconuts, chewing circular holes in the shells to reach the meat inside. Lavery confirmed that the massive rat he found was a unique, new species by checking its DNA against the DNA of other regional rat species, and by confirming with Vangunu Island locals that the rat he captured was indeed the one they called vika. ""Vika's ancestors probably rafted to the island on vegetation, and once they got there, they evolved into this wonderfully new species, nothing like what they came from on the mainland,"" the mammalogist explained.

It also serves a vital purpose beyond drawing tourists. Like allreefs, it provides a buffer for the coast, protecting nearby beaches from brutal waves and storms. And so the beachside businesses that rely on the reef have decided to protect the coral as they would any other vital asset: with insurance. AsFast Companyreports, the reef now has its own insurance policy, the first-ever policy of its kind. Coral reefs are currentlythreatenedby increasing ocean acidification, warmer waters, pollution, and otherocean changesthat put them at risk of extinction. Masscoral bleachingsare affecting reefs all over the world. That’s not to mention the risk of damage during extreme storms, which are becomingmore frequentdue to climate change. Businesses in Puerto Morelos and Cancún pay the premiums for theReef & Beach Resilience and Insurance Fund, and if the reef gets damaged, the insurance company will pay to help restore it. It’s not just an altruistic move. By protecting the Puerto Morelos reef, nearby businesses are protecting themselves. According to The Nature Conservancy, which designed the insurance policy, coral reef tourism generates around $36 billion for businesses around the world each year. Perhaps even more importantly to coastal businesses, reefs protect $6 billion worth of built capital (i.e. anything human-made) annually. When a storm hits, the insurance company will pay out a claim in 10 days, according to Fast Company, providing an immediate influx of cash for urgent repair. (The insurance policy is tied to the event of a storm, not the damage, since it would be hard to immediately quantify the economic damage to a reef.) The corals that break off the reef can be rehabilitated at a nursery and reattached, but they have to be collected immediately. Waiting months for an insurance payout wouldn’t help if all the damaged corals have already floated away. The insurance policy is one of many new initiatives designed to rehabilitate and protect endangered coastal ecosystems that we now know are vital to buffering the coast from storm surges and strong waves. Coral reefs aren’t the only protective reefs: In the eastern and southern coastal U.S., some restaurants have starteddonating oyster shellsto help rebuild oyster reefs offshore as a storm protection and ecosystem rehabilitation measure.

The two-year AIR Louisville project involved the Louisville government, theInstitute for Healthy Air Water and Soil, and a respiratory health startup calledPropeller, which makes sensors for inhalers that can track location and measure air pollutants, humidity levels, and temperature. Propeller's inhaler-mounted sensors allowed the researchers to monitor the relationship between asthma attacks and environmental factors and provided new insight on how air quality can change from neighborhood to neighborhood. The sensors—which are already used by doctors, but have never been deployed citywide before—can measure levels of nitrogen oxide, sulfur, ozone, particulate matter, and pollen in the air, plus track location, temperature, and humidity, all of which can impact the risk of asthma attacks. The sensors send Propeller data on when, where, and how many ""puffs"" patients take to track how often people are resorting to emergency medication. Propeller sent out app notifications to warn the Louisville program participants of greater risk of an asthma attack on bad air quality days, and showed them where and when the most asthma attacks happened around the city. The Propeller program illuminated just how much more asthma-triggering pollution the city’s west side (predominantly home to poor, African-American residents) faces compared to other neighborhoods. The data also showed that ozone provoked an uptick in asthma attacks throughout the city, namely along highways. The study may end up influencing air quality regulations, since the researchers found that air pollutants became problematic for asthma sufferers even under the legal levels. The program had huge short-term benefits, too, beyond collecting research for city policies. By the time itendedin late June, the study clearly had a significant impact on the nearly 1200 people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who took part. The asthma group showed a decline in average inhaler use after a year. There was an 82 percent decline in people's weekly average uses of rescue inhalers at the 12-month follow-up, and the participants had twice the number of symptom-free days. The majority of participants said they understand their asthma ""very well"" or ""well,"" can better control it, and feel confident about avoiding a bad asthma attack. Now that the program is over, the institutions involved are still working to launch new policies based on the results, like creating citywide asthma alerts and planting more trees. [h/tCityLab]"
452,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/509043/our-antidepressants-are-harming-marine-animals,,"An estimated13 percentof Americans are currently taking prescription medication for depression, a 65 percent increase since the early 2000s. These drugs typically act asstimulantsfor neurotransmitters in the brain, which help regulate mood. While the effect is often beneficial for humans, scientists are beginning to learn it's having some unintended consequences for other species. In a study recently published inEcology and Evolutionand covered byNewsweek, researchers at Portland State University took a closer look at how discarded antidepressants that wind up in inhabited waters impact marine life. The authors introduced fluoxetine, the main ingredient in Prozac, into a laboratory body of water inhabited by Oregon shore crabs, orHemigrapsus oregonensis. Normally, the crabs are nocturnal foragers, avoiding confrontation and hiding in sediment when predators appear. After being exposed to the drug, the crabs exhibited a dramatic change in behavior. Instead of shying away from predators—in the lab study, the larger red rock crab—they became more confrontational, increasing the risk of an early death. They also became more active during the day and displayed aggression towards other crabs, engaging in fights. Drugs like fluoxetine end up in inhabited waters in a number of ways. Some people flush unwanted medication down the toilet, a measure that's evenrecommendedby the FDA when users need to quickly dispose of dangerous drugs like OxyContin. Contamination from trash or human urine and stool can also be sources of pollution; a USGS study published earlier this yearfound antidepressantsin the brains of fish living downstream from wastewater treatment plants. The study's authors warn that increased populations near coastal regions may worsen the issue. It's also unknown how concentrations of several different drugs can combine to alter behavior. Right now, it looks like our solution to one problem—depression—may have a host of ecological repercussions. [h/tNewsweek]"

This marks just the second time it's ever been recorded in the wild, and the third species member ever spotted. Jackson's climbing salamander is nicknamed the ""golden wonder"" for its bright yellow color, and it has a thick black dorsal streak that extends from its head to its tail. Jeremy Jackson, along with his friend Paul Elias, first spotted the unique critters in 1975 while hiking through the Cuchumatanes. Their trip also led to the discovery of two additional new species, the long-limbed salamander (Nyctanolis pernix) and the Finca Chiblac salamander (Bradytriton silus). All three creatures turned out to be exceedingly elusive. Expeditions in 2009 and 2010 yielded sightings of the long-limbed salamander and the Finca Chiblac salamander, but Jackson's climbing salamander—which Jackson had originally found hiding beneath bark in a cloud forest,according to ScienceAlert—remained hidden. In April 2017, the nonprofit group Global Wildlife Conservationaddedthe long-lost amphibian to its Top 25 ""most wanted"" species list. The list was part of the organization'sLost Species initiative, which aimed to re-discover—and potentially save—rare creatures that hadn't been seen for years, if not decades. Global Wildlife Conservation planned a January 2018 search expedition to Guatemala to look for Jackson's climbing salamander, but a Guatemalan man named Ramos León ended up beating them to the punch. León, a guard at the Finca San Isidro Amphibian Reserve in the Cuchumatanes (also called the Yal Unin Yul Witz Reserve), was on patrol in October 2017 when he saw—and photographed—a young Jackson's climbing salamander. León then sent the picture to Carlos Vasquez, a curator of herpetology at USAC University in Guatemala. Vasquez, who's credited with rediscovering both the Finca Chiblac salamander and the long-limbed salamander, had been been looking for Jackson's climbing salamander since 2005. He taught León and other guards how to recognize the amphibian— which likes to hide in moss, leaves or bark—and even hung a poster of the creature at the reserve. ""We had started to fear that the species was gone, and now it's like it has come back from extinction,"" Vasquezsaidin a news statement. ""It's a beautiful story and marks a promised future for the conservation of this special region."" He wasn't the only one who was thrilled to hear the news. ""The night I got the news from Carlos thatBolitoglossa jacksonihad been rediscovered, I flew off the couch where I'd been falling asleep, let loose a string of expletives (in a good way), and did a little happy dance,"" Jackson said in a news release. Finca San Isidro Reserve was established in 2015 by an international team of wildlife preservation groups. Their goal was to protect the species' habitat, and it looks like their efforts have paid off. ""With the Cuchumatanes Range under threat—a well-known epicenter for endangered amphibians and one of the highest global conservation priorities—in 2015 we acted swiftly to support the purchase and protection of critical properties,"" said Paul Salaman, the CEO of Rainforest Trust, in a statement.

The decision was made in light of aGerman studyreporting that the number of flying insects in some areas have declined by 75 percent in just a quarter of a decade. Of the species dying off en masse, bees are the most concerning: The insects pollinate a significant portion of our crops, and without them humans could face an agricultural crisis. “These particular flying insects are absolutely critical to the health of the natural world,” Gove wrote forThe Guardian. “Without a healthy pollinator population we put the whole ecological balance of our world in danger.” The alarming state of bee populations is likely a mix ofseveral factors, but human-made insecticides are one of the biggest contributors.Neonicotinoids, the chemical compounds covered by the proposed ban, are the most commonly used insecticides on Earth, and they’ve also been shown to have devastating effects on bee colonies. Getting rid of them completely was first proposed by the European Union in 2013, and after initially opposing the move, the UK is finally getting on board. Neonicotinoids are slowly being phased out inthe U.S., where beekeepers have been reporting beesdisappearing from their hivesfor the last decade or so.

A tree is a marvel of biology. Unfussed by the pull of gravity, it sucks water upward; unembarrassed by its resourcefulness, it makes food out of the waste gases we leave behind. And that’s just what it does for itself; for us, it does even more, cleaning our air, beautifying our neighborhoods, improving ourhealthandwell-being, reducing our energy use, and helping us beat the heat. ""Trees have direct and indirect benefits for cooling buildings and reducing human suffering during heat waves,"" lead author Theodore Endreny of the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestrysaidin a statement. ""The direct benefit is shade which keeps the urban area cooler, the indirect benefit is transpiration of stormwater which turns hot air into cooler air."" Endreny and his colleagues wondered how these qualitative effects might translate into dollars, or rubles, or rupees. The researchers used a tool calledi-Tree Ecoto estimate the amount of tree cover in 10 huge cities: Beijing, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Istanbul, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, and Tokyo. These densely packed megacities are home to almost 10 percent of the entire human population of Earth—people whose lives often depend on natural environments outside city limits. “What is, however, most often disregarded,” the authors note, “is that nature conservation in the city can also contribute to human well-being benefits. The most common mind set separates cities from the rest of nature, as if they were not special kinds of natural habitats.” Their results showed that those urban natural habitats occupied about 21 percent of each megacity landscape. That’s a lot of tree cover, but there could be a lot more; on average, the researchers found another 19 percent of land that could be given over to vegetation. The data suggested that filling this space with trees could increase environmental and cost benefits by an average of 85 percent. As they are now, the trees are already saving megacities gobs and gobs of money—about $1.2 million per square mile, or $35 per resident, per year. ""Placing these results on the larger scale of socioeconomic systems makes evident to what extent nature supports our individual and community well-being by providing ecosystem services for free,"" co-author Sergio Ulgiati of Italy’s University Parthenope said in the statement. ""A deeper awareness of the economic value of free services provided by nature may increase our willingness to invest efforts and resources into natural capital conservation and correct exploitation, so that societal wealth, economic stability and well-being would also increase."""

It led him to rethink his life and his work as an arborist. He looked to the oldest trees he could find in the U.S.—the few remaining coastal redwoods in California—and decided to try bringing the biggest ones back to life. How? Cloning. One stumbling block is that most of the biggest trees, the famous 30-foot-diameter ones, havealready been cut down or burned. How can you get a living cutting from a dead tree? Milarch found that many such trees had secondary trunks called basal sprouts growing out of the same root system. These were genetically identical, and provided viable genetic material. Many plants can be propagated by cloning. In its simplest form, you literally snip off a green bit and put it in water. While this process is substantially more complex for many plants, at its root (pun intended), Milarch is doing the same thing—but adding hormones to divide and multiply a single cutting. Along with his son, Milarch is taking branches from ancient giants and making new trees. He's planting a brand new forest in the coastal town of Port Orford, Oregon. Coastal redwoods and giant sequoias grow fast. They can shoot up 10 feet in a year. Although it will take many generations for a new forest to rival the giants these clones came from, these new trees will reach mature status quickly. And while they're doing that, they suck carbon dioxide out of the air. Milarch has spread his efforts around the world, even cloning several dozen of the largest oak trees in Ireland. HisArchangel Ancient Tree Archivenow operates in nine countries, working to preserve trees and reforest areas with what they call ""new old growth.""

They published their findings in the journalScience Advances. The human body can only withstand so much heat, and the authors of the current paper note that 35°C (95°F) pushes that upper limit. Anything above that will result in death ""even for the fittest of humans under shaded, well-ventilated conditions."" This 95°F maximum is what's called awet bulb(TW) measurement. Like the heat index, TW considers humidity as well as air temperature, which means it's a more accurate measurement of how well our bodies can naturally cool themselves down. The muggier the climate, the higher the TW. And in places like India, the TW is pretty darn high. The research team combined climate data from Pakistan, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka with information about current and estimated future greenhouse gas emissions in those countries. With these combined data points, they created two possible scenarios: the ""business as usual"" model, in which the region's rapidly growing economy continues to produce more and more air pollution; and the ""mitigation"" model, in which something is done to slow, if not stop, emissions. Neither outcome looked particularly good, but there was a big difference between them. The business-as-usual model indicated that average temperatures will easily reach TW 95°F by the year 2100. For the mitigation model, that number was closer to TW 88°F. These were just the total averages. Some regions were far worse off than others. In either situation, poorer agricultural communities in India will be hit the hardest—a particularly dangerous outcome in areas where most people live without air conditioning. ""This disparity raises important environmental justice questions beyond the scope of this study,"" the authors write. ""The findings … may present a significant dilemma for India because the continuation of this current trajectory of rising emissions will likely impose significant added human health risks to some of its most vulnerable populations."""

The toilet’s tank was located underneath the seat, allowingenough roomfor Larsen to become trapped. To his dismay, the tank—which is not connected to a sewage system and is only emptied sporadically—was full of human waste.

It found that, while climate change is likely to significantly reduce the number of hailstorms, the size of the hail formed in these episodes will increase, accumulating larger than 1.6 inches. The regions most affected, the study predicts, will be the states in the central and northern plains. Conversely, the southern and southeastern portions of the U.S. will see a decreased threat. Hailbegins its lifeas a droplet of supercooled water. Then, rather than condensing into rain and falling, it freezes onto a condensation nucleus (dust, dirt) andbounces around like popcorn. This movement causes the hailstone to gather more layers of liquid. Larger hailstones could have very drastic consequences for the environment, as well as property owners that dwell within the storm's reach.

(Heat affects air density, which in turn affects a plane’s lift.) Despite those dire measures, Phoenix isnotthe hottest place on Earth. And it’s not even close. That dubious honor was bestowed on the Lut Desert in Iran in 2005, when land temperatureswere recordedat a staggering 159.3 degrees Fahrenheit. The remote area was off the grid—literally—for many years until satellites began to measure temperatures in areas that were either not well trafficked on foot or not measured with the proper instruments. Lut also measured record temperatures in 2004, 2006, 2007, and 2009. Before satellites registered Lut as a contender, one of the hottest areas on Earth was thought to be El Azizia, Libya, where a 1922 measurement of 136 degrees stood as a record for decades. (Winds blowing from the nearby Sahara Desert contributed to the oppressive heat.) While the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)acknowledgedthis reading as the hottest on record for years, they later declared that instrumentation problems and other concerns led to new doubts about the accuracy. Naturally, declaring the hottest place on Earth might be about more than just a single isolated reading. If it’sconsistencywe’re after, then the appropriately-named Death Valley in California, where temperatures are consistently 90 degrees or above for roughly half the year and at least 100 degrees for 140 days annually, has to be a contender. A blistering temperature of 134 degrees was recorded there in 1913. Both Death Valley and Libya were measured using air temperature readings, while Lut was taken from a land reading, making all three pretty valid contenders. These are not urban areas, and paving the hottest place on Earth with sidewalks would be avery, very bad idea. Temperatures as low as 95 degrees can cause blacktop and pavement to reach skin-scorching temperatures of 141 degrees. There are always additional factors to consider beyond a temperature number, however.

It’s kind of like a robot vacuum, but for invasive fish, according toFast Company.The Guardian, developed by Angle’s nonprofitRobots in Service of the Environment, is an underwater robot designed to stun lionfish, suck them up, and bring them to the surface. Lionfish, native to the Indo-Pacific, are considered an invasive species in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, where they have few predators and huge appetites for both crustaceans and other fish. The fish can eat up to 20 other fish in half an hour, lay up to 40,000 eggs every few days, and live up to 30 years, making them a formidable foe for environmentalists.

The Guardian's ability to reach depths of up to 400 feet will aid fishermen in waters and reefs that can't be easily accessed. Each Guardian can bring up about 10 live lionfish at a time.

But just how hot is lava? How quickly could it consume your flesh and destroy everything in its path? You may already know that lava is actuallymolten rockthat oozes or spurts out of volcanoes because of the extreme temperatures found miles deep in the Earth. As the rocks melt, they begin to rise toward the surface. (Lava is typically referred to asmagmauntil it reaches the surface.) As you can imagine, the heat that's needed to melt rock is pretty staggering. Cooler lava—relatively speaking—could be around570°F, about the same as the inside of your typical pizza oven. On the extreme side, volcanoes can produce lava in excess of 2120°F, according to the United States Geological Survey. Why is there so much variation? Different environments produce different chemical compositions and minerals that canaffect temperature. Lava found in Hawaii from basalt rock, for example, tends to be on the hotter side, while minerals like the ones found near the Pacific Northwest's Mt. Saint Helens could be a few hundred degrees cooler. After lava has erupted and its temperature begins to lower, it will eventually return to solid rock. Hotter lavaflows more quickly—perhaps several feet per minute—and then slows as it cools, sometimes traveling only a couple of feet in a day. Because moving lava takes its sweet time getting anywhere, there's not much danger. But what if you did, in some tremendously unfortunate circumstance, get exposed to lava—say, by being thrown into a lava pit like a villain in a fantasy film? First, you're unlikely to sink rapidly into it. Lava is three times as dense as water and won't simply move out of the way as quickly. You would, however,burn like a S'moreat those temperatures, even if you wouldn't quite melt. It's more likely theradiant heatwould singe you before you even made contact with the hypothetical lava lake, or that you'd burst into flames on contact. Because lava is so super-heated, you might also wonder how researchers are even able to measure its temperature and answer the burning question—how hot is lava, exactly—without destroying their instrumentation. Using a meat thermometer isn't the right move, since the mercury inside would boil while the glass would shatter. Instead, volcanologists use thermocouples, or two wires joined to the same electrical source. A user can measure the resistance of the electricity at the tip and convert it to a readable temperature. Thermocouples are made fromceramic and stainless steel,and both have melting points higher than even the hottest lava. We still don't recommend using them on pizza.

AsInhabitatspotted from theMiami Herald, the recently passed city measure was originally the brainchild ofDelaney Reynolds, a teenager who began writing mayors in her area about the idea in early 2016. After seeing that asimilar city ordinancehad passed in San Francisco, the then 16-year-old Reynolds wrote to South Miami mayor Philip Stoddard proposing that he craft legislation requiring solar panels in new construction. In response, he asked her to help write the law with him. The newly passed legislation requires that all new home construction or large-scale home renovations include solar panels. All houses must have either 175 square feet of solar panels per 1000 square feet of sunlit roof area, or at least enough to produce 2.75 kilowatts per 1000 square feet of living space. The solar power requirement also applies to renovations that replace or extend the structure by 75 percent. South Miami is the first city in Florida to pass this kind of mandate. In Florida, the average solar panel system costs between $10,000 and $15,000 for a 6-kilowatt system, including the federal tax deduction, though those costs vary based on the area (states have their own tax deductions and credits for solar installation) and the type of system. But several years down the line, the investment should start paying off in the form of huge energy savings. In a sunny area like Los Angeles, for instance, homeowners are estimated to save around $90,000 over 20 years, according to the solar marketplaceEnergySage.

This week, itfinally split, creating an iceberg the size of Delaware. At more than a trillion tons, it's one of the largest icebergs ever recorded. The sections called Larsen A and B collapsed in 1995 and 2002, respectively, effectively reshaping the coastline of the Antarctic Peninsula. The Larsen C crack spread slowly—you might say glacially—at first. But by June 2017, it was cruising right along, widening at a pace of about 32 feet per day. Experts at Swansea University’sProject Midas, which monitors the ice shelf, predicted the break would come within ""hours, days, or weeks."" It took about a week. New imagery from NASA’s Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite shows a distinct split in the ice shelf.

The precise cause of the split remains to be seen. While climate change is responsible for melting sea ice around the world, experts say this particular break may have been inevitable. ""We know that rifts like this periodically propagate and cause large tabular icebergs to break from ice shelves, even in the absence of any climate-driven changes,"" Chris Borstad, of the University Centre in Svalbard, told the BBC. ""I am working with a number of colleagues to design field experiments on Larsen C to answer this specific question (by measuring the properties of the Joerg suture zone directly). But until we get down there and take some more measurements, we can only speculate."" [h/tBBC]"
466,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/503223/scientists-figure-out-how-recycle-aluminum-foil-ingredient-biofuel,,"A whole lot of aluminum foil ends up in landfills each year—some 22,000 tons in the UK alone. Like cans,aluminum foilcan be recycled, but because we tend to use foil to pack food, that’s a tricky proposition. Many recycling centers won’t take dirty aluminum foil, since the contamination from greasy and oily food can damage recycling equipment. New research led by engineers at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland has found another way to make use of that old aluminum foil, even if it does have food stuck to it. As New Atlas reports, the study inScientific Reportsintroduces a crystallization method that allows contaminated foil to be transformed into pure aluminum salt crystals. This can be turned into a chemical catalyst to makedimethyl ether, a biofuel that is considered apromisingalternative energy source, especially to run diesel engines. Essentially, the researchers dissolved the foil in a chemical solution that turned it into crystals, then used another chemical mixture to purify those crystals. The resulting 100 percent pure aluminum salts can be used to create alumina catalyst, a key ingredient for making dimethyl ether. Alumina catalyst created by the tinfoil process would be cheaper than the current commercial version, according to apress releasefrom the university. It costs about $72 per pound, compared to $183 per pound for the existing commercial catalyst. In addition, the commercially available catalyst is made from bauxite ore, and like many materials that need to be mined from deep within the earth, obtaining bauxite is a resource-intensive process with major environmentalcosts. So if this technique lives up to its promise, the benefits of being able to recycle even food-soiled aluminum for a second use would be two-fold. It would save used aluminum from the landfill, and allow researchers to produce more of this biofuel without causing environmental harm. [h/tNew Atlas]"

You’ll be asked to report on a variety of topics including your meat-eating tendencies and the number of nights you spend in a hotel each year. When the survey is complete, you’ll be shown your carbon footprint in tons plus the number of trees needed to offset it. If your household carbon footprint is equivalent to less than 243 trees for your home, 14 trees for transportation, and 43 trees for travel, you're below the U.S. average.

Scientists say chemicals from trash in our landfills are making their way into our waters via the seagulls’ gastrointestinal tracts. A report on this delightful state of affairs was published in the journalWater Research. We generally stop thinking about our trash the moment the garbage truck comes to collect it. But it doesn’t just disappear. No, our coffee filters andcorn-chipbags head to the landfill, where they sit and sit and sit … unless they get eaten first. Then their nutrients, their nitrogen and phosphorus, disappear into an animal’s gullet and reappear on the other side, sometimes a few days later, sometimes miles away—and sometimes in our lakes, rivers, and streams. Researchers wondered how much of an impact these trash-picking critters could have. They were especially interested in seagulls, whose poop has previously been shown tocarry tracesof toxic chemicals from ourplastic-filled seas. The first step was to figure out just how many landfill-mooching seagulls we have. Authors Scott Winton and Mark River of the Duke University Wetland Center used documented seagull sightings in theeBirdcitizen science database to estimate the number of landfill-living gulls across the entire United States. Their calculations came up with about 1.4 million birds. ""But the actual population is probably greater than 5 million,” Winton said in a statement. “That means the amount of nutrients deposited in the lakes, and the costs of preventing or remediating the problem, could be substantially higher."" The scientists then used that 1.4-million figure to calculate the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus the birds might collectively be dumping. ""The idea that gull feces can be a major water quality problem may sound comical—until you look at data from an individual lake,"" Winton said, noting the impact on North Carolina'sJordan Lake, home to a 14,000-acre state recreation area and more than 1000 campsites. ""In Jordan Lake, for instance, we found that a local flock of 49,000 ring-billed gulls deposit landfill feces containing nearly 1.2 tons of phosphorus into the lake annually."" That phosphorus changes the water's chemical composition and could lead to more algae blooms, which can kill off other organisms in the lake’s ecosystem. Winton and River suggest that rather than clean our waters after they're polluted, a better approach might be to stop the problem at the source: our trash. They recommend limiting landfill size and covering existing garbage heaps to keep the seagulls from ever finding it."

The cabs most Londoners are used to hailing are currently powered by diesel fuel, which releases much more toxic emissions than regular gas. With London facingdeadly air pollutionlevels, city officials are pushing to replace the smog-producers with cleaner modes of transport. The new cab runs on an electric battery for the first 70 miles of its journey before switching to a fuel reserve for the next 400. (The average cab travels about 120 miles a day.)

The group just released new policy suggestions on the subject, asInhabitatreports. ""Despite the energy efficiency benefits, some LED lights are harmful when used as street lighting,"" Maya Babu, a neurosurgeon and AMA Board Member, says in apress release. Most LEDs emit mostly blue light, which is problematic for several reasons. The high contrast of the light—which appears bright white—increases glare and can be uncomfortable for the eyes, making it a road hazard. It’s also bad for people who want to get to bed at a decent hour. Blue light suppresses melatonin, making it hard for people tofall asleep. Doctors and sleep experts recommend that you turn off your electronics before bed for this reason, but you can’t exactly turn off the street lights in yourwhole neighborhood. Bright city lights are harmful to animals and plants, too. Light pollution can encourage trees tobud earlierand disrupt the sleep cycles ofbirds. The AMA estimates that about 10 percent of existing street lighting in the U.S. has been replaced with LEDs. The organization doesn't recommend staying away from LED street lights altogether, but recommends using lights that emit as little blue light as possible, reducing glare. They also suggest that street lights could be dimmed during off-peak hours. Bulbs should also be shielded so that the light shines where it’s supposed to, rather than into the bedrooms of neighbors or up intothe sky. There’s a reason we call bedtime ""lights out.""

AsGizmodoreports, climate change is grooming the southwest and central Great Plains for a new version of the Dust Bowl that plagued the region in the 1930s. After gathering 12 years of satellite data (2003–2015), researchers at Princeton University and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predict that dust clouds will increase in parts of the U.S. in the latter half of this century. As they lay out in their study inScientific Reports, prolonged drought and barren landscapes caused by deforestation are set to create the perfect conditions for the same type of storms that drove people from the Great Plains nine decades ago. At its worst, this phenomenon could be deadly; when they're not breathing in dust, residents in the affected areas could be exposed to dangerous pathogens and chemicals carried by air currents. Dust storms occur when winds stir up dirt particles into dark, massive clouds. During the so-called Dirty Thirties, soil loosened byover-tillingwas a major contributor to the dust that enveloped land. Even with more sustainable farming practices, dry summers could create the same arid, dusty landscapes required for a repeat of the Dust Bowl. While there's still much research to be done on the subject, the study authors hope their findings will get people thinking about how to prepare for the consequences. ""Our specific projections may provide an early warning on erosion control, and help improve risk management and resource planning,"" co-author Bing Pusaidin a Princeton University press statement. That seems like an improvement over ideas forfighting the Dust Bowlthat were proposed in the 1930s, which included paving over the Great Plains and bombing the sky.

As oysters’ role in maintaining a vibrant coastal ecosystem becomes more clear, environmental groups are trying to bring back devastatedoyster populations. In some places, this means getting restaurants to recycle their leftover oyster shells to put back into the ocean instead of sending them to a landfill, according toFast Company. This is particularly important along the Gulf Coast, where theAlabama Coastal Foundation(ACF) set up a recycling program in 2016 to collect used oyster shells from local eateries. According to The Nature Conservancy, 67 percent of the U.S. oyster harvest comes from the Gulf of Mexico [PDF]. The Nature Conservancy has been working throughout the Gulf of Mexico to restore oyster populations. So far, the effort in Alabama, a partnership between the waste collection company Republic Services and the ACF, has collected enough oyster shells to cover 7.2 acres of sea floor. The program is currently funded by a grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and is free to restaurants, though that may change in the future. Alabama isn’t the only place oyster shells are becoming a hot commodity. In New York City, theBillion Oyster Projectis working to restore oyster populations and reefs in New York Harbor, in part to make Staten Islandmore resilientto superstorms and flooding. (Hurricane Sandyravagedthe island's east and south shores in 2012.) In New Jersey, the American Littoral Society is seeding local waterways with new oysters inBarnegat Bayin hopes of both restoring the once-vibrant oyster harvesting industry there and cleaning the waterways. Other oyster repopulation projects are ongoing in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Gulf Coast fromFloridatoTexas. On the West Coast, thePuget Sound Restoration Fundplans to restore 100 acres of native oyster habitats by 2020. However, oyster habitat restoration isn’t as easy as it sounds. In a15-year studyof Rhode Island’s oyster restoration programs, the oysters had such a high mortality rate that populations began declining immediately when the programs stopped actively re-seeding the beds with new oysters. Another worldwidestudyfound that the median survival rate for oyster bed restoration projects was only 56 percent. As many current oyster restoration projects are just gaining steam, it may be years before we find out if they can be as effective as natural oyster beds. [h/tFast Company]"

But Muir was more than a great explorer and advocate of national parks—he was also an ingenious inventor. As a young boy in Scotland and later Wisconsin, Muir developed an obsession with clocks. There was just one problem: His authoritarian father, Daniel, filled every waking hour with chores and religious education. By the time he was 11 years old, John could recite three-quarters of the Old Testament and the entire New Testament “by sore flesh,” ashe wrotein his memoir, a reference to the brutal beatings his father inflicted on him if he failed to fulfill his duties. Daniel Muir had little patience for his son’s budding interest in engineering. So John came up with a solution: wake up earlier than the rest of the family and try out ideas he had come up with while plowing during the day. He began to get up at 1 a.m. to read. “Five hours, almost half a day!” he later wrote. “I can hardly think of any other event in my life, any discovery I ever made that gave birth to joy so transportingly glorious as the possession of these five frosty hours.” Soon he was doing more than reading: In the wee hours of the morning, he made a labor-saving sawmill. His creativity stoked by his first success, Muir decided to figure out a way to make the most of his precious morning hours. The “early-rising machine,” as he called it, was not just a way to work on his engineering skills, it was a way to make sure he got out of bed. In his memoir of his boyhood, Muirdescribes the inventionas “a timekeeper which would tell the day of the week and the day of the month, as well as strike like a common clock and point out the hours; also … have an attachment whereby it could be connected with a bedstead to set me on my feet at any hour in the morning; also to start fires, light lamps, etc.” Muir faced several obstacles in creating his ambitious invention, however: Not only were his days crammed full of work, but he lacked both the raw materials and his father’s permission to spend time whittling instead of working. For months, Muir hoarded small scraps of wood, carving them in every spare moment, and hid his invention in a spare bedroom upstairs. When his father finally discovered the machine, Muir thought he would burn it. But after delivering a lecture about the wickedness of spending spare time on “useless, nonsensical things,” he did nothing—and Muir finished it in full view. Despite his naysaying, Muir’s father even seems to have tried it out. “This he did repeatedly,” wrote Muir, “and evidently seemed a little proud of my ability to invent and whittle such a thing, though careful to give no encouragement for anything more of the kind in the future.” Not that Muir needed much encouragement. Once his early-rising machine was finished, he made even more wooden clocks, including one shaped like a scythe that included the uplifting message “all flesh is grass.” Another clock was so large it could be read by the neighbors. (Muir’s father put a stop to that, fearing that it would draw too many onlookers.) Once Muir got to college, he kept on inventing clocks. His dorm room at the University of Wisconsin, Madison doubled as a workshop, and he invented another alarm clock designed to help him excel in school. This desk alarm clock was perhaps his greatest mechanical triumph: Not only did it wake him up in the morning, it lit a lamp to illuminate the room, and after giving him a few minutes to dress, served up the first in a stack of study books—even opening the book up for Muir to read.A clicking deviceheld the book in place for a specified amount of time, before closing it, sweeping it away, and putting the next book in its place. Muir even modified the machine to respond to the morning sun during the summer, using a glass lens on his windowsill to burn through a thread that would snap and trigger the clock’s mechanism. But Muir’s most impressive invention didn’t involve wheels, cogs, or mechanics. Though he gained a reputation for his engineering,a machine accidentthat left him partially blind in 1867 pushed him more and more to his other love, the outdoors. In 1889, Muirdrew a mapthat would change the world—a map of the boundaries of land in Yosemite, which he thought should be preserved by the federal government. This led not just to the creation of Yosemite National Park, but to the Sierra Club—an organization Muir co-founded on May 28, 1892—which has advocated for the conservation of America’s natural glory for 125 years. Today, the inventor-turned-naturalist is considered one of the grandfathers of American preservation, but it all started with a curiosity honed during stolen hours, helped along by some very clever clocks."

484,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/94668/antarctica-covered-rivers-lakes-and-waterfalls-might-not-be-good,,"The floating ice shelves that buttress Antarctica are less icy than we thought, it turns out. They’re filled with flowing water. New research published in the scientific journalNaturemaps the extensive network of meltwater fromAntarctica's ice sheetsand found that, contrary to previous understanding, lakes and rivers—even waterfalls—created by melting have been common for at least seven decades. Two new papersanalyze satellite imagery ofAntarcticadating back to 1973 and aerial photography dating back to 1947 for evidence of meltwater. Warming oceans melt ice shelves around from the bottom up, while warming air temperatures melt them from the top down, creating pools and rivers ofliquid wateron the continent's surface. Researchers found that over the last 70 years, a system of meltwater drainage has transported water from the continent of Antarctica across the floating ice shelves that surround it, traveling up to 75 miles and creating ponds up to 50 miles long. This isn’t great news for the stability of the ice shelf. Water is heavy, and the weight can cause the ice below these lakes to crack. As glaciologist Alison Banwell wrote in aseparate analysisof the studies forNature, “If a lake suddenly drains through a crevasse to the ocean below, the load deficit from the ice shelf’s surface can induce more crevasses, potentially triggering a chain reaction” of draining lakes. “This process might have been responsible for the large-scale break-up of Antarctica’s Larsen B Ice Shelf in 2002, when more than 2000 lakes drained in just a few days.” All that water ends up in the ocean, contributing to rising sea levels. As NASA geophycisistAla KhazendartoldNPRin January, ""Ice shelves are very important. They are the gates of Antarctica in a way, and the gatekeepers of Antarctica."" TheNational Snow and Ice Centerestimates that if the Antarctic Ice Shelf—which covers 98 percent of the continent—melted, sea levels would rise by as much as 200 feet. All that makes meltwater a little worrisome for climate scientists, but there may be a silver lining, at least according tooneof the published papers. One river network the researchers studied ends in a 427-foot-wide waterfall that can empty the entire amount of meltwater produced by the ice shelf annually in just seven days. That may make the ice shelf more stable, since the meltwater gets funneled into the ocean immediately instead of building up on top of the ice shelf and cracking the ice below. “Export of meltwater by surface rivers may buffer the impact of warming temperatures,” the researchers wrote. At least when it comes to breaking up ice sheets. Unfortunately, those drainage systems are still really effective at sloughing off water into the ocean, which will still affect sea level rise."

Salt & Straw—whichhas locationsin Portland and Los Angeles, and upcoming ones in San Francisco andSeattle—has partnered with local businesses and organizations likeUrban Gleanersand thePortland Fruit Tree Project, both of which rescue edible, surplus food and give it to the needy, to create these unique treats. Salt & Straw will use their excess bounty to develop new, creative flavors, and raise public awareness about food waste. Plenty of factors contribute to food waste, including lack of storage space, lack of distribution chains, and passing food fads, Salt & Strawexplained in a press release. But at the same time, many people in the U.S. go hungry. “We were really struck by the idea that we waste 40 percent of our food in the United States, and that children in our cities are going hungry,” Salt & Straw founder Kim Malek toldFast Company. “If we were able to use that food, we could wipe out hunger.” Salt & Straw estimates that their June menu will only save around 2000 pounds of discarded food from ending up in landfills. That said, the company’s end goal is more about educating customers, and proving that “it’s possible to make something incredible and fun out of something that was going to be wasted,” according to Tyler Malek, Salt & Straw’shead ice cream maker. Salt & Straw's June menu will feature flavors including Second-Steeped Rum Spices and Apple Butter and Spent Brewer’s Malts & Candied Bacon S’mores. For the former flavor, Salt & Straw teamed up with Urban Gleaners and Portland’s Eastside Distillery.

Experts writing in the journalClimatic Changesay that small changes like avoiding processed meat could save billions of dollars in healthcare costs and help us reach crucial environmental protection goals. It’s no secret that the standard American diet is harmful. Our consumption of saturated fats, red meats, and refined sugars has been linked to rising rates of heart disease and metabolic disorders like type 2diabetes. Growing and preparing these foods also takes a huge toll on the environment, producing around 30 percent of America’s greenhouse gas emissions every year. But a complete dietary overhaul is just not an option for many people. Processed foods are more accessible, longer-lasting, and often cheaper than fresh food. Telling Americans to “just eat healthier” is not going to solve our problems. Small changes, on the other hand, might be doable. So researchers at UC Santa Barbara decided to calculate potential benefits—not of an entire nation going vegan or only buying local food, but of what might happen if we all took just a few baby steps toward healthier eating. They pulled data from previous studies on diet, greenhouse gas emissions, disease, and healthcare costs to create a baseline. Then they built theoretical models of new diets, some with lower amounts of red and processed meat and some with none at all. To make up for the now-missing calories, they added more fruits, vegetables, beans, and peas. They replaced some, but not all, white flour with whole grain alternatives. They didn’t cut added sugar, dairy, eggs, fish, or non-red meat. They then fed their new diet models into the formulas used to calculate the baseline to see if there was any difference in the outcome. There certainly was. Simply making little changes had an enormous impact in every category. The results showed that cutting back or eliminating red and processed meat could reduce Americans’ relative risk for coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer, and type 2 diabetes by as much as 40 percent. They could save the country $77 billion (or more) in healthcare costs and reduce each person’s greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 500 pounds per year. “Food has a tremendous impact on the environment,” study director David Clevelandsaidin a statement. “That means that there is enormous potential for our food choices to have positive effects on our environment as well as on our health and our health care costs.”"

State officials recently approved a plan to generate electricity from vibrations produced by cars driving down freeways, according to theSan Francisco Chronicle. The California Energy Commission recently voted to put $2.3 million into two piezoelectricity projects, which convert pressure into power. One pilot will test a 200-foot-long piece of asphalt on UC-Merced’s campus, while the other experiment will be built by the San Jose green technology company Pyro-E. The company's technology is expected to generate enough power to supply 5000 homes using less than a half-mile of piezoelectric highway. The idea is that highways could produce energy mechanically, much likea watchruns on the mechanical energy of a spring. Stacks of the inch-long devices would be installed under roads, moving slightly each time a car rolled over them. The high volume of cars passing above each day would in theory turn that little bit of movement into a significant source of energy. The same idea has been floated forwood flooring,sidewalks, anddance floors. The technology is still in its early stages, though, and there’s no guarantee that California’s roads will be generating power anytime soon. (If it was more advanced, you would have seen a lot more electricity-generating dance floors, after all.) If any state is likely to implement these unusual sources of power, though, it would beCalifornia, which is already a leader in sustainable energy in the U.S. In one recent milestone, California’s solar panels produced40 percentof the state’spoweron one day in March, though it was only for a few hours.

Patrons can drop off objects they no longer want or need at a designated recycling depot. Items that can be repaired are fixed and re-sold in the mall’s nine shops, which offer customers everything from furniture to clothing items to sporting equipment. Goods that can’t be sold are donated to needy institutions or organizations, or recycled. The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, is the nation’s largest shopping center—and it’s also vying for the title of “greenest.” In addition to LED parking garage lighting, water-efficient toilets, and thousands of air-purifying plants and trees, the mallannually recyclesmore than 2400 tons of food waste by donating it to a local hog farm. (If you’re an entrepreneur who’s interested in emulating the MOA’s large-scale food waste strategy, you can check out the Environmental Protection Agency’s guidelines for getting startedhere.) Around8.8 million tonsof plastic enter the ocean each year. Soda bottles, grocery bags, and six-pack rings aren’t the only plastic items polluting the world’s waterways and harming fish, turtles, and other animals: In 1997, marine conservationist Julie Church came across a beach in Kenya that was strewn with discarded flip-flops. Church noticed children making toys from the debris, and convinced local women to collect, wash, and process the flip-flops into colorful art objects. This initiative grew intoOcean Sole, a fair-trade business that today collects flip-flop flotsam from Kenya's beaches and waters andtransforms theminto plastic sculptures, accessories, and trinkets. Ocean Sole's goal is to recycle 750,000 flip-flops per year, and the organization also provides business opportunities to women living in city slums and remote coastal areas.

Work at a beauty salon or own a furry pet? Instead of tossing shorn or shed hair into the trash, donate it to Matter of Trust. The San Francisco-based ecological charity’sClean Wave programcollects hair and fur, and uses it to make oil-absorbing mats and stuff containment booms.

According to anew studyfrom the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading, the roller coaster sensation in passenger planes could see up to a 149 percent increase. The paper, which was published inAdvances in Atmospheric Sciences, identifies climate change as the culprit. With increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, planes will have a more difficult time with the vertical wind shears that create resistance and destabilize an aircraft. Study author Paul Williams estimated that light turbulence, which iscommon, could see a 59 percent increase; drink-spilling moderate turbulence up to a 94 percent increase; and heavy turbulence a 149 percent increase. Although turbulence rarely results in serious injury today—according to one study,just 24 passengers and crewwere injured in 2013 out of the 826 million travelers who flew that year, though the researchers of the current study cite data documenting higher rates in different years—a marked change in frequency could conceivably lead to more accidents, particularly with unbelted passengers and loose luggage.

492,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501254/25-things-you-didnt-know-about-worlds-oceans,,"In 2008, the United NationsrecognizedWorld Oceans Day on June 8 as a time to celebrate the immense bodies of water that cover roughly70 percentof the Earth’s surface. The goal of the day is to promote conservation efforts and engage activists in preserving these five crucial areas—the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern (Antarctic) Oceans—and their inhabitants. If you don’t know much about the deep blue sea—like why it's not actually blue, for example—check out 25 facts we’ve culled about the world’s largest and most fascinating real estate. One of the most indelible features of the ocean is the deep blue waters that continually churn, roll, and come in waves. The color is theresultof the sun’s red and orange wavelengths being absorbed by the surface and its blue wavelengths penetrating deeper, giving way to a blue tint. And because those wavelengths can travel farther down, the ocean willtend to appearmore blue the lower you go. Why isn't water in a glass blue when you're sitting outdoors? There aren't enough molecules to absorb the light. If you could catch sight of the miles of cable criss-crossing the world’s oceans, it would look like a giant, submerged web. Communications companies maintain international connections byfeeding cables downto (hopefully) flat surfaces on the ocean floor. Some require shark-proof layers to prevent predators from biting into your Netflix stream (although the danger of sharks has been vastly overhyped—human activity is a far bigger threat). The Mariana Trench isconsideredto be the deepest part of the world’s oceans—and the deepest point on Earth. Inside the Trench is a valley known as Challenger Deep that extends roughly 7 miles (36,070 feet) below the surface. For comparison, the entirety of Mount Everest—at 29,029 feet—could easilybe accommodated there. Until recently, crewed explorations hadn’t gone any farther than 35,797 feet below the surface, a record set by two oceanographers in 1960. In 2012, filmmaker James Cameron explored roughly the same depths in asolo mission. In 2019, Victor Vescovomade historyby becoming the first person to reach the deepest part of the ocean. Researchers onceloweredan underwater microphone called a hydrophone to almost the bottom of the Mariana Trench to see what sounds—if any—it might pick up. Fortunately, the immense pressure at those depths—about8 tonsper square inch—didn’t implode the equipment, allowing the scientists to discover sound from earthquakes, passing baleen whales, and other ambient noise was audible. Some surfaces in the ocean feature sights that don’t seem to make any logical sense—rivers and lakes, some of them miles long, can stretch across the ground even though they’re submerged. How can a body of water exist in a body of water? Water from under the sea floor seeps up and dissolves salt layers, forming depressions. Because the water in the depression isdenserthan the water all around it, it settles into the depression and forms a distinct pool. If you’re hoping to find a fortune in gold prospecting, don’t expect the ocean to cooperate. You may be able to plunder a shipwreck, but you won’t be able to collect much of the 20 million tons of gold estimated to exist in the water. That’s because it’sso dilutedit’s measured in parts per trillion. One liter of seawater might net you a 13-billionth of a gram. You might see mentions that we’ve ""mapped"" more of Mars than we have the Earth’s oceans, but that’s not quite true. Oceanographers have been able to visualize almost 100 percent of the ocean floors, albeit in aresolutionthat makes it difficult to spot a lot of detail. In that sense, images of Mars and other planets have been able to offer more information because they’re not covered in water that can block radar. Although we haven't explored the vast majority of the oceans first-hand, technology has enabled us to have a rough idea of their layouts. TheDenmark Strait, a waterfall below the Atlantic Ocean, is the equivalent of 2000 of the world’s most notable waterfalls, with cascading liquid pouring 11,500 feet down. The Strait’s cold water on the eastern side is more dense than the warm fluid coming from the west. When the two waters mix, the colder supply sinks, creating a waterfall. Size and water pressure conspire to limit our exploration of the oceans, so much so that it’s estimated we’ve identifiedonly one-thirdof the potential marine life lurking beneath the surface. It’s possible most of those are smaller organisms, but it’s likely that some whales and other mammal species have yet to be discovered. We’re making progress, though: An average of 2000 new species are described each year. WhenMagellancrossed the Atlantic beginning in 1519, he eventually found his way to another body of water—what hedubbedthe Pacific, or peaceful, ocean due to the calm surface. He didn’t know it at the time, but the Pacific would eventually be recognized as the largest ocean on the planet at 59 million square miles. Known as Point Nemo, the area is roughly 1000 equidistant miles away from the coasts of three neighboring islands. It’s so remote thatastronautsare often closer to any theoretical occupants than anyone on dry land. Up to 80 percent of volcanic eruptions go unnoticed by land-dwellers. That’s because they’re erupting underwater. More than 1 million volcanoes—some extinct and some very active—spew molten hot lavabeneath the surfaceof the ocean. Despite the heat, creatures can still be found near their superheated vents. Researchers believe these areas harbor several undiscovered species that are invulnerable to the harsh environment, which includeswater temperaturesup to 750°F. It’s impossible to offer an accurate estimate of how many shipwrecks and accompanying treasures are lurking in the ocean, but a few people have made an honest effort of it. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) thinksa million sunken shipslurk in the dark; others peg the total value of the unrecovered treasures at $60 billion. So why don’t we hear more stories of watery grave-robbing? Because governments or private parties are likely to make a legal claim to those funds, making an expensive expedition for treasure a gamble at best. Forget all the beauty and wonder of the world’s oceans: At the bare minimum, they’re responsible for supplying us with oxygen. Oceans produce70 percentof the oxygen supply in the atmosphere, thanks to marine plants releasing it as a byproduct of photosynthesis. One phytoplankton,Prochlorococcus, is estimated to be solely responsible for one in every five breaths a human will take. One reason pollution is such an issue for oceans: It can rob them of the oxygen needed to support life. When run-off from waste disposal gets into the water, it can feed an overabundance of algae, which then dies and sinks. As it decomposes, the algaeconsumesthe available oxygen in the water. That creates hypoxic areas, or hot spots with a lack of oxygen. If fish and other marine life don’t find a new space to dwell in, they’re toast. With over 7 million tons of plastic winding up in the ocean each year, it’s inevitable that a lot of it winds up as part of an unwelcome addition to a fish’s diet. For fish in the northern Pacific, researchers at the University of California, San Diegoonce estimatedthey swallow between 12,000 and 24,000 tons every year. Those aquariums in pet stores and dental offices may remind you of marine life, but they could also be having anegative impacton the environment. When tropical fish are caught, fishing crews use sodium cyanide to make them float out of the reef for easy scooping. While the hope is that it just stuns them, the residue of the chemical can bleach coral reefs and kill scores of other fish. When waves reach shallow water near land, energy that would normally be dispersed goes up, elongating the wave. A 1958 earthquake and landslide in Alaska generated atsunami100 feet highand destroyed all vegetation up to 1720 feet, the largest in recorded history. Calledinternal waves, these water walls have been found 3 miles below the surface. The waves are part of water layers with different densities and can reach heights of 800 feet before collapsing. Scientists believe these massive forcescan helpmove heat and nutrients to other areas. As most everyone knows, drinking salt water is perilous at best and deadly at worst. In a process calleddesalination, that salt is removed, leaving fresh water. But building facilities and the energy required to process water this way has traditionally been more expensive than using water from potable sources. Not familiar with this creature? If you saw one, you’d know. The bristlemouth is a fish a little smaller than the average human finger that has a mouth full of fangs and can glow in the dark. It’s also the most common vertebrate in the world. For comparison? Chickens could number as many as 24 billion on land, while bristlemouths are said to add up to thehundreds of trillions. Giant kelp, orMacrocystis pyrifera, is a type of seaweed that experiences anastonishinggrowth spurt. To reach its usual height of 100 feet, the species can grow up to 2 feet in a single day. In 1992, a shipment of bath toys was headed from China to the U.S. when the cargo ship dropped a container. More than 28,000 rubber ducks—or duckies, depending on your preference—and other play-animalswere dumpedinto the North Pacific Ocean.

Though it only has one native palm species—the rest are imported—the carefully trimmed trees are an instant visual that reads ""paradise."" Sadly, some palms are now being eaten by weevils. The South American palm weevil is a big lumpy beetle with a mission: burrow into palm trees and lay eggs. They favor the Canary Island date palm, sometimes called the ""pineapple palm"" referring to its distinctive shape after pruning. Female palm weevils drill into the apical meristem (""heart of palm"" to foodies) to lay eggs. The newly hatched weevils start life in a bountiful environment, surrounded by food and water. They eat the trees' heart out, leaving a mushy ruin in their wake. Then the larvae proceed with their lifecycle, maturing inside cocoons they make from leftover palm fibers. When they hatch and fly on, the cycle repeats. This slow escape can kill the tree, as the apical meristem is where the tree sprouts new leaves. In many cases the weevils leave the tree in a state of severe injury, with a characteristic wilt to its existing leaves. Finding these weevils isn't easy—once they've burrowed in, they're basically undetectable until the damage is done. The current best practice for preventing their spread is to treat palm trees with anti-weevil pesticides. As the weevils begin to invade San Diego, scientists are tracking their spread.

Trees and other urban plantsremove pollutantsfrom the atmosphere,reduce stress, and supportbetter overall mental health. In fact, being around more trees can make you feel as healthy as someone seven years younger, according to a 2015 study in theNaturejournalScientific Reports. Psychologists compared data about differences in street tree coverage across Toronto with how healthy people felt, according to a survey called theOntario Health Study. The long-term study included self-reported data from more than 30,000 individuals, which the researchers used to determine how people perceived their health. People who lived in neighborhoods with a higher density of street trees (not just parks) reported feeling healthier than people who lived in areas with fewer trees. In terms of how people viewed their health, living on a block with 10 more trees was the equivalent of earning $10,200 more a year, or being seven years younger. While these findings only applied to how people felt about their health, not how healthy they actually were, people living near more street trees also reported fewer cardiac conditions like high cholesterol or heart disease. A 10-tree per block increase across Toronto would only require about a 4 percent more trees total in the city. Because Canada has a universal health care system, the same results might not hold true in countries like the U.S., where the private system means that health care access can vary dramatically based on income and place of residence. But all other factors being equal, it appears we have yet another reason tolove trees."

Following efforts by local municipalities to destigmatize the use of recycled sewage water for human consumption, Escondido, California-based Stone Brewing has recently introduced a craft beer made from recycled toilet water. According toThe Sacramento Bee, the brewery was motivated to experiment with wastewater after California’s long drought limited their conventional water supply sources. Using treated water from San Diego’s Pure Water Facility, the brewery produced five barrels of what it calls Full Circle Pale Ale, a “toilet to tap” beverage. The recent public tasting, attended by San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, was intended to highlight the city’s multi-billion-dollar pursuit ofharvesting drinking waterfrom sewage systems; the goal is to put recycled wastewater back into the water supply instead of dumping it into the ocean. The cityestimatesthat by 2035, one-third of the area’s fresh water will be made up of recycled and treated H2O. Citing the “yuck factor,” city officials believe efforts like Stone Brewing's will help the public embrace the idea of the treated water being reused. Treatment facilities usemicro-filtration tubesto filter out contaminants, with reverse-osmosis eliminating solids. A combination of ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide provides additional antimicrobial benefits. But will the general public ever really be able to set aside the fact that their weekend is being lubricated by poop-nourished beer? City officials claim it’s going on anyway. “Las Vegas does treat and discharge their wastewater into Lake Mead, which is one of the areas where we pull our water,” Brent Eidson, deputy director of external affairs at San Diego’s Public Utilities Department,told CityLab. “Helping them realize this has been going on for a very long time helps them understand and accept this program.” Steve Gonzalez, Stone Brewing's senior manager of brewing and innovation, said that the ale’s taste has some “caramel notes” with “tropical fruit” hints.

It’s home to one of the oldest wildlife rescues in the U.S., theAark Wildlife Rehabilitation and Education Center. Over the course of the year, Aark takes in more than 5200animals, focusing its efforts on anything wild, native, and in need. That means everything from sick hawks to injured raccoons to orphaned squirrels, rabbits, and fawns. Aark doesn’t see its mission as saving the environment as much as helping both four-legged and two-legged creatures deal with how human activityaffectsanimal habitats. “As human beings encroach more and more on their habitats, they get involved with us in often not-good ways,” Aark’s executive director, Leah Stallings, tells mental_floss. “So instead of the squirrel building the nest in the tree, they build it in the house—because the house is where the tree used to be. And then people have squirrels living in their ceiling.” Neither the people nor the squirrels win in that kind of situation. “It’s not really the people’s fault, but it isn’t really the animal's, either,” she explains. Aark can help alleviate the problem for both. “There’s no government place where you can take something like that—that’s where we come in.” Image Credit: Sara Kushner, courtesy Aark Wildlife Rehabilitation and Education Center viaFacebook Having critical care centers for wildlife that has been affected by human activity—whether it’s a songbird with a broken wing or a raccoon that’s been orphaned after its mother got hit by a car—gives the animals a second chance at life, and the people who are desperate to help, but don’t know a place to go. Aark isn’t the only center of this kind—but since wildlife rehabilitation centers are not particularly abundant, Aark has more than its fair share of furry and feathered clients. According to Stallings, people drive up to two hours to bring injured and sick animals to the clinic. So to make room for more animals, the center is embarking on an ambitious expansion plan that includesfundraising$300,000. The money will go toward more than tripling the rehab center’s space, expanding it from 1000 square feet to 3600 square feet. As is, the center—which was founded in 1979 by Stallings’s mother—has a critical care room where young animals that need to be fed around the clock or animals that need constant medical attention can be housed, as well as a separate room for animals that are known to transmit rabies (like raccoons). Then the center has what it calls a “step-down unit,” a covered, outdoor area where animals who are on the mend can reacclimate to life outdoors without being completely exposed, as well as an actual outdoor area for animals that are almost ready for release. Currently, the center can only support so many animals, both because they don’t have the room to house them safely and hygienically, and because they don’t have the room for any more volunteers. The expanded building will make it a lot easier for 50 to 75 baby raccoons to run around in one room without getting each other sick, and the center will be able to bring in two or three more volunteers per shift. Once Aark raises the $300,000 necessary for its expansion, Stallings hopes to break ground on the new construction in October and open up the new clinic by April 1, 2018. Aark is open every day of the year, 24 hours a day, and in the busy months of May and June, it may take in as many as 20 or 30 animals per day. So while the construction timeline may be ambitious, speed is necessary. “We have to finish it during the off season,” Stallings says. “I have never closed—not one day.”"

In May, NASA’sAqua satellitefirst spotted the vivid swirls in the Black Sea, where the Bosphorus originates. From there, the bright bloom drifted all the way down to Istanbul, transforming the strait—which divides Turkey into its Asian and European sides—from royal to electric blue. This is far from the first time these bright colors have appeared; images from space have spotted them year after year in early summer. This is last year's bloom. These grand, painterly sights are made possible by a type of phytoplankton called coccolithophores. These single-celled, plant-like, disk-shaped organisms live near the water’s surface. Like full-size plants,coccolithophorestake in sunlight and other organisms’ discarded nutrients and turn them into food. They’re an essential part of both the food chain and the carbon cycle, helping collect and sink excess carbon to the sea floor. Each soft coccolithophore is armored in a limestone shell, or coccolith. The shells reflect the sunlight back up through the water, producing a milky turquoise visible from space. Experts say that while larger and more frequentplankton bloomscan block sunlight at the water’s surface and harm other organisms, a modest annual color change is no cause for concern. And this year's show is especially brilliant."

500,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501889/polar-bears-are-consuming-less-mercury—-theres-downside,,"Scientists studying mercury levels in polar bears say that melting sea ice has forced the bears to change their diets. The researchers published their study in the journalEnvironmental Science & Technology. Mercury is all around us. Some of it occurs naturally in plants, animals, and the soil. Some of it is our fault, the result of industrial pollution from coal and other fuels. Regardless of its source, it piles up in living things the same way. Tiny animals eat plants containing mercury, and the mercury stays in their bodies even after all the plant matter is gone. Then those tiny animals are eaten by small animals, and on and on, onward up the food chain. Apex predators like swordfish and sharks areswimming globs of mercury, which is why we tell pregnant women not to eat them. For the same reason, they shouldn’t eat polar bears, either (although we would kind of like to see them try). Previous tests on bears in the southern Beaufort Sea found alarmingly high mercury levels in the animals’ hair and body tissue—the result of the bears’ diet of mercury-saturated ringed seals. Or theirformer diet, we should say. Researchers followed Beaufort Sea bears from 2004 to 2011, taking regular tissue and hair samples from sedated bears and by long-distance biopsy dart. Chemical analysis of the samples showed a clear and steady decline in mercury levels. Each year, the bears’ bodies contained 13 percent less mercury. But it’s not as though these bears were getting 13 percent smaller. They weren’t wasting away. So what had happened? It turns out their main prey, ringed seals, had grown scarce. Ringed seals spend most of their time on sea ice. But as the sea ice disappeared, so did they. In response, the bears shifted their predatory attention to bearded seals and bowhead whales, both of which carry less mercury. Even as their mercury levels dropped, the bears' BMI increased, perhaps because they were eating more blubber from the larger prey. The authors note that the bears in their study might not represent all bears in that region. They could only take samples from the bears they could find along the coast. Less successful hunters might still have been struggling out at sea. They also say that the polar bears’ prey-switching is, sadly, not a sustainable solution. We’re not exactly experiencing a surplus of whales, here."
501,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/24361/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-jacques-cousteau,,"French naval officer, explorer, and filmmaker Jacques-Yves Cousteau helped millions of people learn about what goes on under the ocean's surface. How well do you know the man in the wetsuit, who was born on June 11, 1910? Let's take a look at five things you might not have known about the master of the deep. When Jacques-Yves Cousteau was a young man he joined the French navy, but he never had any intention of going underwater as part of his service. Instead, Cousteau planned on becoming a naval aviator, but that dreamed died when Cousteau was in a seriousauto accidentin 1936. The young pilot borrowed his father's Salmson sports car to attend a wedding and had ahorrific crashwhen the headlights shorted out on a dark road. Cousteau was so severely injured in the accident that it seemed like resuming his pilot's training was impossible. Cousteau needed a way to rehab and strengthen his broken arms, though, so he took to swimming in the ocean. Later that year, Cousteau made his first underwater swim in goggles, and he realized that he had found his calling. Soon after Cousteau discovered his love of the undersea world, he also declared his love forSimone Melchior. The couple married in 1937, and Simone was never in the shadows of Jacques's life. She went along on expeditions on his shipCalypso, helped him secure financing for his projects, and even sold her family jewels to help buy fuel for the ship. Simone took such good care ofCalypso's crew that they nicknamed herLa Bergere, or ""The Shepherdess."" Quite a storybook romance, right? You can imagine how surprising it was when, in 1991, Jacques announced that not only did he have a mistress, but an entire secret family. One year after Simone's death from cancer, Cousteau told the world that he had been having a longtime affair withFrancine Triplet, who was more than 30 years his junior. Cousteau also announced he had two secret children from the affair. He later married Triplet. Cousteau's famed shipCalypsogot its start as a British minesweeper during World War II, and after the conflict ended she became a ferry in Malta. In 1950 Irish millionaire Thomas Loel Guinness, a descendant of the storied brewing family, bought the ship. Guinness didn't hang onto the ship for long, though. He leased her to Cousteau for a pretty sweet deal: one franc per year. The ship has had a bit of a rough time since Cousteau made it famous. In January 1996,Calypsowas in Singapore when a barge accidentally rammed her. The ship sank and had to be pulled from the water by crane for extensive restoration. Following Cousteau's 1997 death, the two wings of his family fought a bitter battle over the future of the ship. For years, the ship's new owners have worked on restoring it and in 2016 announced that it will explore the seas once again in the future. In 2016, Francine—Jacques's second wife and president of the Cousteau Society—toldThe Telegraphthat she was, ""particularly happy to announce this news after a 20-year fight against adversity and twists of fate ... When theCalypsoreturns to the Mediterranean, it will be navigable and running on its own engines, as captain Cousteau wished.” In 2017, a fire damaged part of the Calypso while it was being restored in Istanbul. ""This situation reinforces my determination to carry out Captain Cousteau's wish for Calypso to sail again,"" Francine Cousteausaid. ""I have been fighting for over 20 years to protect the legacy that the Captain has passed on to the Cousteau Society. It is a passionate and complex mission, which I won’t abandon, no matter the obstacles along the way. For Calypso, we have an excellent shipyard with dedicated project managers and exceptionally motivated carpenters, who have all been working with love and skill. For them, and for all of those who share the hope of seeing this ship rebuilt, I want to succeed."" In 1985, Cousteau and his crew ventured to Cuba to research the country's unique system for managing its lobster population. While there, Cousteau received Fidel Castro on his ship for dinner. Castro seemed to takea likingto Cousteau; the dictator allowed the diver to liberate 80 political prisoners. Cousteau and his team also received another unique honor: they became the first non-Cubans to pass through the gate of the U.S. Navy's Guantanamo Bay installation since the Cuban missile crisis 24 years earlier. Cousteau may have co-invented the Aqua-Lung and become one of history's most famous divers, but he dreamed of his creation one day becoming a medical reality. In a 1960 interview withTIME, Cousteau predicted that in the future, medical science would advance to the point where men could surgically be given gills that would enable them to live underwater. Cousteau figured if that surgery could be perfected, so could a follow-up procedure that would remove the gills and enable normal life back on land. He told the magazine, ""Everything that has been done on the surface will sooner or later be done under water. It will be the conquest of a whole new world."" This story has been updated for 2019."

Cats remain the biggest killerof American birds, but colliding with buildings is a close second, killingbetween 100 million and 1 billion birdseach year as they crash into stationary objects. The collisions are often the result of light pollution, which can disorient night-flying birds, and shiny building materials that reflect the sky. Because crashes are common during migrations, these periods are a great time for researchers to collect data on how, where, and why the accidents happen. To do that, they need people power. Bird lovers across the country are turning up in droves to their local bird and wildlife organizations to help count and record collisions, and the information they’ve amassed is already making a difference. Data collected by citizen scientists with New York City’sProject Safe Flighthelped identify the species at greatest risk (and thus the species in greatest need of intervention). Volunteers in other cities can add their records directly to research databases. Other organizations even station volunteer bird rescuers by common collision sites to collect those that crash and bring them to wildlife hospitals. While glass-covered skyscrapers do present an obvious problem, conservationist Joanna Eckles of Audubon Minnesota says lower buildings are just as much of a threat. “Most birds are killed by our homes,” shesaidin a statement. But this is good news, she added, “because it means this is a preventable problem.” Want to help? Check in with your local wildlife group orAudubon Societyto see what kind of work they have for citizen scientists. You can also take some easy steps to help crash-proof your home. Turn off lights when you leave the room. Replace porch lights with downward-facing LEDs to reduce glare. Add decals to large, high-risk windows to make the glass obvious, or cover them with soft nets or screens. For even more tips, check out the Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP) bird-proofingwebsite.

In an effort to combat the city’s rapid growth (an average of 600,000 residentsperyearflocked to the city between 2000 and 2013) and the traffic congestion and pollution associated with it, China plans to build an entirely new city to take the pressure off its capital,Curbedreports. The Chinese government recently announced a regional economic project called the Xiongan New Area, which will be a new metropolis built about 60 miles south of Beijing. According toChina Daily, Beijing will remain the functional capital of China, but the new city will take over some of the general economic functions that have so far been concentrated within Beijing. The idea is that some of Beijing’s industry and business will move to Xiongan, and with it, some of its population. With jobs no longer concentrated so densely in Beijing, people will be able to live closer to their work, giving them more transportation options and cutting down on air pollution. Not that it’s necessarily going to happen that way. Planned cities don’t always work out as well as their spontaneously developed cousins. Many of the world’s greatest and most vibrant metropolises were created without any kind of central planning, while meticulously master-planned cities can come off as sterile and soulless. (Think of New York City’s cramped but bustling streets versus Washington D.C.’s grand boulevards.) As Adam Greenfield wrote inThe Guardianin 2016, “Most of the planet’s newest cities bear a markedly strong resemblance to one another. Whether they happen to be planted on African terrain or Indian or Chinese, they have the self-contained, inward-turning flavor of a high-end condo, and indeed are branded and marketed in just the same way.” But this isn’t China’s first time creating a major new city. After Shenzhen was named a Special Economic Zone in 1980, it went from a 300,000-person town to a major financial hub that’s now home to 11.9 million people. Real estate speculators are betting on the same thing happening in Xiongan, though—a few days after the new city was announced, so many people rushed to buy property that the government instituted anemergency banon sales.

Though Smithson designed it in 1970 with the idea that the red-hued water on the lake’s northern shore would ebb and flow, ongoing droughts are likely to make it permanently dry, according toHyperallergic. The sculpture—a 1500-foot-long, 15-foot wide coil of rocks—has been completely obscured by the lake’s saline waters before. It was created during a low-level time in the lake’s history, and when the lake returned to normal levels just a few years later, it was completely submerged. It was invisible, viewed only through photos and videos taken during its creation. But since 2002, continued droughts in Utah have brought it above the water line for the long term. Rather than reddish water, the black basalt rocks that make up the sculpture are now covered in salt crystals. The water is not going to come back to the sculpture anytime soon. The lake currently is experiencing itslowest water levelsin recorded history. Between October 2015 and October 2016, the shoreline of the lake’s northern arm fell by almost 10 inches, from 4190 feet above sea level to 4189.2 feet. While that doesn’t sound like much, it’s a drastic difference from the lake’s historic high-water mark, at 4211.2 feet above sea level. Smithson may have actually been pleased with the development.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spent years capturing and breeding the surviving scavenger birds to save them from extinction, slowly trying to reintroduce some into the wild. The work is paying off. About 200 condors currently live in the wild, in Southern California and Arizona, but northern California will soon have its own condor population. Fifteen U.S. agencies and the Yurok tribe have collaborated on a2-year planto reintroduce them to the Redwood National and State Parks. They held the first of five public meetings about the program in northern California last week, according to theSan Francisco ChronicleandSFist. The plan for how to restart northern California's wild condor population isn't yet solidified, and the agencies will still have to prepare an environmental impact report. And it's likely that not everyone will be psyched about the birds' reintroduction. According to theChronicle: The upcoming public meetings will be a chance for those opposition groups to bring their concerns forward. The condor has mythological significance to many Native American tribes in California, but it’s aparticularly sacredanimal for the Yurok.

To prevent uneaten meals from ending up in landfills, some choose to dispose of scraps by composting them. However,as Co.Exist reports, this well-meaning approach can backfire: According to a new study led by researchers at Ohio State University, diners who know their leftovers will be turned into fertilizer don't try as hard to reduce their food waste during a meal. Led by Brian Roe, an agricultural, environmental, and developmental economics professor, and OSU graduate student Danyi Qi, the experiment observed 266 participants as they ate a self-serve meal of sandwiches, chips, and apple slices. They were allowed to take as much food as they wanted, but they weren’t allowed to share meals or save any leftovers. At the meal’s end, researchers weighed diners’ trays to measure how much food they left behind. Before the meal, subjects were given some reading material, either educational pamphlets about the environmental harm of food waste (this made up the ""educated"" group) or information about financial literacy (the ""uneducated"" group). However, around half of the participants in both groups were informed that their waste would be composted, while the rest were told it would end up in a landfill. Diners who didn't think that composting was an option responded strongly to the educational materials: Those who read the pamphlet detailing the harmful effects of food waste ended up wasting 77 percent less food than those who received the financial literacy one. Educated diners were also nearly 40 percent more likely to finish their entire meal (leaving no waste). However, the positive effects of the education were nullified when diners were told their table scraps would be composted: When diners thought their waste was going to a ""good"" place, they had leftovers on par with the uneducated group. The study's findings pose a challenge for policymakers aiming to reduce America’s food waste. They’ve tried to tackle the problem with public education and with landfill diversion techniques, like composting. However, these two approaches appear to “cancel each other out—they work at cross purposes,” Qisaid in a press release. “It seems that if [people] feel that the social and environmental cost is lower, they may feel less guilty and that may cause them to waste more,” Qi added. Also, Roepoints out toThe Columbus Dispatch, people may feel less inclined to take multiple steps to help the environment if they’ve already completed one. ""Once one box has been checked, there's not much appetite to do another thing,"" Roe said. ""Maybe for some people, that box has been checked off (with composting)."" At the end of the day, composting your food is a better option than throwing it away. However, it’s better to avoid wasting edible goods in the first place—and with a little strategic planning, you can. At home, people can limit food waste by sticking to a strict shopping list of the essentials, cooking only what they’ll actually eat, and donating leftover edible foods to food pantries or shelters. As for restaurant owners, they can try giving customers a crash course in environmental awareness, instead of simply telling them they compost leftovers. “Do it, but just don't brag about it,"" Qi told theDispatch.

The city council just voted to allocate $250,000 of that money to an “Integrated Sustainability Action Plan” to begin moving St. Petersburg to a 100 percent renewable energy and zero-waste model. In addition, $250,000 will be put toward assessing the city's energy efficiency, and $300,000 will go to evaluating and mitigating the area's risks from sea level rise and hurricanes. These aren't the only moves the city has made toward sustainability. Earlier this summer, Mayor Rick Kriesman issued anexecutive orderfor the city to implement policies to eventually become a net-zero municipality, and this budget plan will further his goals.

But one company is trying to make fashion a little more environmentally friendly, asCo.Existreports. A Pittsburgh-based company calledThread Internationalrecycles trash collected from streets and canals in Haiti to create thread and fabric that puts plastic bottles to good use and provides jobs. The company estimates that its trash-centric manufacturing process reduces water use by 50 percent compared to the manufacture of a cotton shirt. Thread International also prides itself on creating fair wages and safe working conditions for its employees in some of the poorest parts of Haiti and Honduras, motivated by founder Ian Rosenberger's desire to help Haitians after the country's 2010 earthquake. Threat International makes yarn and thread and sells itsown fabric. Fashion companies like Timberland and Kenneth Cole are using the company’s materials to make shoes, bags, and clothes. HP is using the recycled plastic to make printer cartridges. The brands who use Thread’s materials end up paying a little more than they otherwise would, but the process uses 80 percent less energy than making virgin polyester, according to Co.Exist.

AsNew Scientistreports, the Danish metropolis will become the first city to power its water system using energy harnessed from sewage and wastewater. After undergoing a $3.2 million renovation, Aarhus’s Marselisborg Wastewater Treatment Plant is now capable of creating heat and electricity out of biogas. The waste is served up as a meal to bacteria kept in 100-degree ""digesters,"" or large tanks. Byproduct gases like methane are then burned, generating more than 150 percent of the electricity required to power the plant. Any surplus electricity is either used to supply fresh water to the city of 200,000, or is sold back to the grid. The concept of using human waste as an energy resource isn’t a new one: Last year a study from the United Nations University’s Institute for Water, Environment, and Health reported that biogas produced by all the world’s human poop could provide energy to up to138 million homes. Aarhus is the first city to integrate this innovative idea into their water system, and now cities like Chicago, San Francisco, and Copenhagen are interested in following suit. For Aarhus’s success to be recreated elsewhere, water plants need to be big enough to produce large amounts of biogas and the wastewater they use has to be the right makeup (too much water dilutes the energy content). Cities also need to have the funding to make the necessary infrastructure upgrades. Aarhus Water’s investment in their plant was pricey, but savings in maintenance and electricity sold to the grid are expected to make it up in five years. [h/tNew Scientist]"
511,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/89829/9-ways-christmas-trees-are-reused-after-holidays,,"You don’t need a calendar to tell you when the holidays have ended—just take a look outside to see if rows of skimpy, dried-out Christmas trees are lining the curb. Each year, roughly33 million live Christmas treesare purchased in North America, many of which end up rotting in landfills once the new year arrives. But making our days merry and bright isn’t the only thing a felled evergreen is good for. Here are some ways Christmas trees continue to serve a purpose long after their decorations have been packed away. Thetreethat’s erected in Manhattan’s Rockefeller Center each November is arguably the most iconic Christmas display there is. It’s also one of the largest, reaching up to100 feet talland often weighingmore than 10 tons. That’s a lot of lumber, and luckily, Habitat for Humanity makes sure it’s put to good use. Every year since 2007, Rockefeller Center has donated its tree toHabit for Humanity Internationalafter taking it down on January 9. From there, the festive behemoth (usually a Norway Spruce) is divided into sections in the plaza before it's shipped to a mill in New Jersey for additional sawing. It’s eventually made into 2-by-4 and 2-by-6 beams used in construction projects around the country. Homes in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Morris, New Jersey, and Philadelphia all contain pieces of what was once the world’s most famous Christmas tree in their walls. If you were to walk along the bottom of Lake Havasu between Arizona and California long enough, you’d eventually come across the site of a Christmas tree graveyard. What may be a creepy scene to holiday lovers is a lush utopia for fish—the branches of the spruces, firs, and pines provide a hiding place from predators and attract food for the fish to nibble on. The875-acre artificial reefresting on the lakebed consists of PVC pipe, cinder blocks, concrete sewer pipe, brush, andthousands of Christmas treesweighed down with sandbags. Decades of decomposed plant matter have built up a healthy layer of moss and algae around the non-degradable structures. This green coating attracts insects, which in turn attract fish looking for a snack. The end of the holiday season marks the introduction of 500 new trees to the reef, each of which will take about five or six years to break down completely. Spend a day on the beach in summertime and Christmas trees will likely be far from your mind—but on at least one beach along the East Coast, there are thousands of abandoned conifers buried in the sand. That’s becauseBradley Beach, New Jerseydepends on recycled Christmas trees to build its sand dunes. Discarded trees are laid out on the beach and held in place between two parallel fences. Sand that blows in from shore gets caught in the branches, eventually packing into a full sand dune over the course of several seasons. Unlike piles that have been pushed together with bulldozers, sand dunes that are allowed to build naturally over time provide a more stable barrier against storm surges. When the time is right, the town plants dune grass to give the structures even more stability, with the vegetation'shairy rootsanchoring trees in the sand. An elephant plays with a Christmas tree at a zoo in Germany. Image credit: Odd Andersen // Getty Images In the wild, many animals encounter plant life that changes with the seasons. TheOakland Zooin California hopes to simulate this seasonal variety in captivity with annual Christmas tree donations. Each year, a local Christmas tree lot hands over whatever’s left of their inventory at the end of the season. The zoo’s residents are more than happy to take the trees that others didn’t want—zebras munch on the needles, squirrel monkeys swing from branch to branch, and otters play games of “smell and seek” with treats hidden in the trees by zookeepers. Oakland’s zoo isn’t the only one to take advantage of the surplus of trees at the end of year. TheStaten Island Zoo, theNorth Georgia Zoo, theLinton Zoological Gardens in the UKall accept tree donations. Christmas trees are a key tool in the fight to save Louisiana’s marshland. The state loses25 to 35 miles of coastal wetlandsa year to advancing ocean tides, and one thrifty way to prevent further damage is by building fences around the marsh’s perimeter. Since the Santa Saves the Marsh project began in 1986, over 1.5 million Christmas trees have been used for this purpose. Following the holiday season, bundles of timber collected from around the country are flown in via a helicopter on loan from the Army National Guard and dropped into the wetlands below. These trees are used to stuffpre-built wooden penssurrounding the bayou. Today, more than eight miles of Christmas tree fencing lines the vulnerable habitat, and it’s already proven valuable: When Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana’s southern coast in 2005, the shoreline behind the barricade was better protected. Christmas trees likely aren’t the alternative fuel source of the future, but that hasn’t stopped Burlington, Vermont from ringing every watt of energy they can get from their seasonal haul. The Joseph C. McNeil Wood and Yard Waste Depot collects hundreds of unwanted trees from households and Christmas tree lots at the end of each holiday season. That organic waste gets fed to a wood chipper, and part of the mulch that comes out is sent to the local power plant where it’s tossed into a boiler. The heat generated from the boiler evaporates water into steam that's used to power the turbine in the plant's generator. Each tree that's incinerated amounts to about 36 cents worth of energy for the town. TheMerry Mulch Projectisn’t able to produce enough fuel to keep the plant running on 100-percent Christmas tree power (for that, the boiler would need to be fed the equivalent of 100 trees per second), but luckily, Burlington uses other renewable resources likewind and waterto keep the city running throughout the year. It’s hard to go for a hike through Dunbar Cave State Park in Tennessee without trampling on ghosts of Christmas past—all of the mulch used to cushion their trails is made from old Christmas trees. A thousand trees are mulched by the park as part of their annualTrees to Trailsprogram and laid along pathways by volunteers. According to theNational Christmas Tree Association, Friends of Dunbar Cave board member David Boen said they stick to Christmas trees exclusively because “by definition they don't have any invasive species or seeds.” In addition to making them easier to walk on, mulch also protects trails from damaging water run-off. Since2012, artist Michael Neff has installed a seasonal art project in New York City. “The Suspended Forest” started with a handful of forgotten Christmas trees hung illegally beneath an overpass in Williamsburg. The most recent iteration included40 floating treesharvested from sidewalks and tree lots after Christmas. They were on display in a warehouse in Queens through the month of January (this time around, Neff had actually received permission to put them there). He hopes to keep bringing the exhibit back to New York and potentially re-imagine it for different cities in the future. If a Christmas tree doesn’t end up hanging in a warehouse, decomposing on a lakebed, or providing festive scenery for a landfill, it’s most likely turned into mulch. Plenty of towns pulverize their discarded Christmas trees for use inparks and public spaces, but San Diego does something a little different with theirs. For decadesthe Miramar Greeneryhas invited city residents to pick up free mulch and compost for use on private property. After dropping off unwanted trees at locations around town or dumping them on the curb, families can visit the Greenery later in the year to collect the mulch they helped contribute to. In a single year, the recycling program can make mulch out of nearly 1000 trees, making the city’s Christmas trees the gifts that keep on giving."
512,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/89660/could-feeding-seaweed-cows-help-save-climate,,"Cattle were first domesticated from wild aurochs about10,000 years ago, as a portable source of wealth for our ancestors, and have proliferated alongside us ever since. There are now about 1.5 billion cattle on Earth, making a lot of milk and meat for human consumption, but in the process, creating a tremendous amount of waste. Not only do cowspollutegroundwater with their excrement, they also produce a lot of gas. Headlines are fond of discussing the issue of cow farts, but in reality, the gas that scientists are concerned about—methane—comes mostly from cow burps. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, with a climate change impact 25 times greater than carbon dioxide. Earlier this year, researchers from Denmark's Aarhus Universitylaunched a four-year studyto gauge whether adding a potent type of Greek oregano to cow feed could reduce methane emissions from dairy cow belches. Earlier research led by Penn State scientists suggested that oregano could cut cows’ methane emissions up to 40 percent. Now, Australian researchers have found even more promising results from a beach staple (or nuisance, depending on your perspective): seaweed. Scientists on theAgriculture and Food teamat Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) showed introducing a particular kind of seaweed,Asparagopsis taxiformis, to livestock feed can reduce the methane production in sheep by more than80 percent. Some of those researchers also did experiments with artificial cow stomachs, which found evenhigherpotential reductions. “Seaweed’s been fed to cattle since farming began,” agricultural scientistRobert Kinley, part of the CSIRO team, toldmental_floss. Anywhere it washed up on beaches near where cows grazed, the animals would eat it, so it’s long been a natural food source. But after a farmer on Prince Edward Island in Canadanoticed in 2006that his cows that ate seaweed were healthier than those that he kept inland, researchers—including Kinley, then at Nova Scotia's Dalhousie University—began investigating. “Nobody really cared about seaweed until 10 years ago, but since then there have been various seaweeds on the market because it improves animals’ reproductive success and makes for healthier, happier animals,” says Kinley. Cows that eat seaweed have more efficient digestion, with 10 to 20 percent fewer methane emissions. Methane only persists in the atmosphere for about 10 years, as opposed to carbon dioxide’s hundreds of years, so cutting how much methane cows produce could help immediately address climate change impacts. For farmers, better cow digestion creates economic benefits by making the cost of feed more efficient. So supplementing feed with seaweed has recently become a trend, and that’s where Kinley got involved—he wanted to make sure seaweeds were safe for cows to eat regularly. As he was testing different types of seaweeds, he wondered if there was one that might cut methane even more than 20 percent. He reached out to a group at CSIRO ""who already had some ideas about the unique chemistry of seaweeds,"" he says. They began collaborating. ""We wanted to find seaweeds that would benefit animals and reduce greenhouse gas emissions too."" They found what they were looking for inAsparagopsis taxiformis,a red seaweed. It aids digestion as other seaweeds do, but has an additional gas-reducing function. “The big punch comes from an enzyme inhibition. The seaweed chemistry debilitates the methanogen process so the pathway to form methane can’t be completed,” says Kinley. This leads to cows producing much less methane—a reduction of99 percentin preliminary tests on the artificial cow stomachs. However, that reduction was dependent on a constant supplementation of the seaweed to keep the methane-reducing benefits going. Once the supplementation was stopped, methane production went right back up. Kinley and his colleagues are now working on health protocols to establish the seaweed is safe for long-term consumption; next up is a feedlot trial with cows to determine what minimum amount of seaweed supplementation is needed for methane reduction. Kinley sees an opportunity to create jobs by cultivating seaweed farming in places whereA. taxiformisgrows, which is pretty much everywhere; it's acosmopolitan species with multiple lineages(and is considered invasive in some locations). Right now, no one’s farming it, which presents a barrier to scaling up. “The biggest barrier isn’t animals or time, it’s how much seaweed can we get?” says Kinley. “Right now, I need 25 tons of seaweed just to do a feedlot trial with 1000 animals.” But if cultivation takes off, the seaweed could be a quadruple win—helping clean wastewater and remove runoff nutrients and carbon dioxide near reefs, growing happy cows, aiding farmers, and mitigating climate change."

514,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/93109/experts-predict-widespread-ocean-warming-2050,,"A study published this week in the journalNature Communicationsfinds that climate change will affect up to 86 percent of the world’s oceans within the next few decades—and that it’s not too late to do something about it. TheCoupled Model Intercomparison Project(CMIP) is a large-scale collaboration by atmospheric and climate scientists around the world. The fifth phase of the project, which ended in 2014, yielded 20 different models, or simulations, of our planet’s climate in the past, present, and future. For the latest study, researchers combined data from 12 of the 20 CMIP models, focusing on how climate change could affect the oceans. The results were grim. If humans proceed with business as usual and continue to degrade the environment, the researchers say, we can expect to see significant warming and acidification in more than four-fifths of the ocean. On a global scale, that will mean melting ice caps and rising sea levels. It’ll also affect millions of marine species, including those central to human diet and industry. Changing waters will force species from plankton to polar bears to adapt, migrate, or die. Migration will not be an option for coldwater species, lead author Stephanie Henson of the British National Oceanography CentretoldReuters. “Arctic fish don’t have anywhere to go.” “How individual species will fare, or how the ecosystem as the sum of its parts will fare, is poorly understood,” the authors write. “What is clear however is that there are likely to be winners and losers in the future ocean.” But it wasn’t all bad news. These predictions are based on a future in which humans have failed to protect the planet. It’s not too late, the researchers say, for us to do better. “The exposure of marine ecosystems to climate change-induced stress can be drastically reduced via climate mitigation measures,” they write. The more steps we take to mitigate climate change, the more time we’ll be able to give marine species to adapt and survive."

Now researchers say we may be able to inoculate ourselves against real-looking fabrications the same way we would against any other epidemic. They published their findings in the aptly named journalGlobal Challenges. Lead author Sander van der Linden is a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge. “Misinformation can be sticky, spreading and replicating like a virus,” hesaidin a statement. “We wanted to see if we could find a ‘vaccine’ by preemptively exposing people to a small amount of the type of misinformation they might experience.” Van der Linden and his colleagues at Cambridge and George Mason University recruited 2167 participants from across the United States and asked them to rate their familiarity and agreement with a variety of statements about climate change. Some were true, such as: “97% of scientists agree on manmade climate change.” Others were falsehoods created and spread by disinformation campaigns, such as: “There is no consensus on human-caused climate change."" Some people were shown just the facts; others saw only the falsehoods. Others saw a combination of both in varying proportions. As the participants read through the materials, they were asked repeatedly if scientists agreed about human-made global warming, in order to judge which stories they believed. The results were what you might expect. Being shown only the facts increased participants’ understanding that there is scientific consensus by 20 percentage points. The folks who only saw the falsehoods experienced a 9-percent drop in that understanding. Showing participants fact and fiction at the same time had worrisome results: fiction seemed to cancel fact out. This is especially problematic at a time when many media outlets insist on presenting a false “balance” on issues like climate change, even though the facts are clearlypiled upon one side of the scale: climate change is real and caused by us. ""It's uncomfortable to think that misinformation is so potent in our society,"" van der Linden said. ""A lot of people's attitudes toward climate change aren't very firm. They are aware there is a debate going on, but aren't necessarily sure what to believe. Conflicting messages can leave them feeling back at square one."" But there’s good (real) news. The researchers also gave one subgroup of people an ‘inoculation’: a warning that “some politically motivated groups use misleading tactics to try and convince the public that there is a lot of disagreement among scientists.” It worked. People who were given this fake-news vaccine reported a 6.5-percent increase in their understanding that there is scientific consensus on climate change even after they’d read misinformation. Remarkably, this effect held strong even among people who were predisposed to reject climate science. ""There will always be people completely resistant to change,” van der Linden said, ""but we tend to find there is room for most people to change their minds, even just a little."""

The electric hybrid buses charge automatically when they pull up to the bus stop, where a charging station is buried under the asphalt. It takes seven minutes to charge the bus battery enough for the full 6.2-mile route. Right now, the Södertälje buses charge overnight and then at the final stop on the route.

518,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/90243/pollution-can-give-you-high-blood-pressure,,"A few bad days of smog due to a temperature inversion might do you no harm, but long-term exposure to air pollution has now been linked to disease. According to a longitudinalstudyout of Europe, prolonged exposure to dirty air can lead to an increased risk of hypertension, a condition of chronic high blood pressure that damages your vessels, your heart, and can lead to atherosclerosis (inflammation of the arteries), heart attacks, and strokes. “This is important because hypertension is the most important risk factor for chronic disease and premature mortality,” lead author Barbara Hoffman, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the Centre for Health and Society at Heinrich-Heine University of Dusseldorf, Germany, tells mental_floss. Prior research had ascertained that “acute changes in air pollution exposure from day to day could raise your blood pressure” in a transient way—that is to say, your blood pressure would rise, but then return to normal. But it was not known if such long-term exposure could lead to the disease of hypertension. The study, published inEuropean Heart Journal,confirms the link between long-term air pollution and increased risk of hypertension. The risk is comparable to the effect of being overweight, Hoffman says. Of the 41,072 people who participated in the longitudinal study, none had hypertension when they began, but during the follow-up period—at either five or nine years—15 percent had developed hypertension or were taking blood pressure medications. And for people living in the most polluted areas, for every 5 micrograms per cubic meter of pollutants, the risk of hypertension increased by 22 percent over those living in less polluted areas. Pollution varies from area to area, of course, depending on where you live, which is why the study looked at five different European countries: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and Spain. Using land regression statistical models, scientists collected data from 40 sites three times per year for two weeks each period. “Major constituents of pollution in a city include traffic, industrial activity, parts blown in from long-range transport, a mixture of all kinds of things close to you, such as heating of houses, agriculture, and Earth-crust material,” Hoffman says. Agriculture, for example, accounts for a large amount of “precursor gases” that coagulate in the air and form small particles. Hoffman found that overall, southern Europe had higher levels of pollution than the Scandinavian countries. Hoffman says pollution is thought to cause hypertension by one (or more) of three ways. First, when you inhale pollution particles, they can lead to “pulmonary inflammation, which gives you systemic inflammation,” says Hoffman. “This damages blood vessels and leads to endothelial dysfunction. Arterial stiffness increases, which affects your blood pressure.” Second, the particles you inhale find their way onto receptors in your lungs that influence your nervous system, particularly the sympathetic nervous system. “This leads to an increase in heart rate, contraction of blood vessels, and a rise in blood pressure. If this happens chronically, you can develop hypertension,” she explains. Finally, as the pollutant particles directly enter your bloodstream, your blood vessels are damaged “by inflammation, oxidative stress, and can lead to impaired function of the vessel.” In Europe, the limit value—or how much pollutants are allowed in the air—is 25 micrograms per meter. In the U.S., that number is only 12. Hoffman says, “Our current limit value doesn’t protect the European population.” Hence, the need for this study. “We wanted to inform the European Government, the E.U., about healthy facts at current levels of air pollution.

Scientists analyzing deep-sea crustaceans found traces of manmade chemicals in the animals’ bodies. The researchers published their findings in the journalNature Ecology & Evolution. Amphipods, like the one shown above, are small, eyeless crustaceans that make their homes in the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean. The key to the deepwater amphipod’s survival is its stomach; it is both notoriously unfussy about what it eats, and gifted with special enzymes that help it digest just about anything, including plastic, animal carcasses, and evensunken ships. But the oceans are a risky place to dine these days. Scientists have found dangerous chemicals, fibers, and pieces of plastic in the bodies ofseabirds, mammals,mollusks, andfishalike. The question for oceanographer Alan Jamieson and his colleagues was simple: How far down do these pollutants go? To find out, they used deep-sea landers to collect three species of amphipods from theMarianaand Kermadec Trenches in the Pacific Ocean. They brought the animals back to the lab and tested their fatty tissue, looking for traces of 14 different pollutants. And there they were. High levels of pollutants, including flame retardant chemicals, were found in every sample from every species, regardless of the depth at which the sample was collected. The contamination was so bad, it was comparable to that found in Japan's Suruga Bay, long known for its high level of industrial pollution. The authors say the chemicals most likely reached the trenches while clinging topieces of plastic garbageor the bodies of dead animals from closer to the surface. Biologist Katherine Dafforn of the University of New South Wales weighed in on the research in an accompanying editorial. She concludes that “Jamieson et al. have provided clear evidence that the deep ocean, rather than being remote, is highly connected to surface waters and has been exposed to significant concentrations of human-made pollutants.”"

So engineers periodically dredge the sand from offshore and pump it right back onto the beaches. This has been going on for decades. (And occasionallythey dredge up bombs!) Part of our sand-loss problem is that billions of tons of sand are also used in construction (most notably in concrete), effectively locking it up so it can't be reused on beaches. So, over the long haul, we are running out of sea sand. Why not just use desert sand for the construction stuff? We have lots of deserts in the world, with lots of relatively bomb-free sand in them! Sadly, desert sand doesn't work for construction because of its chemical composition. So for now we're stuck using a resource that is only renewable on an extremely long timeline, as waves crash onto shores.

521,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/92746/4-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-feed-birds-or-any-animals,,"People love to feed birds. And squirrels, chipmunks, deer—even bears and sharks. We do it for our own pleasure and, sometimes, under the misguided impression we are helping hungry animals. But step away from the stale bread—here are four reasons why feeding wildlife is almost always a bad idea, both for the animals and for us. Researchers at Murdoch University in Western Australia and University of Aberdeen in Scotlandanalyzednearly two decades worth of data from Chicago’s Brookfield Zoo Sarasota Dolphin Research Program and Mote Marine Laboratory’s Stranding Investigations Program and found an increase in the number of dolphins being fed by humans—along with an increase in dolphins injured or killed by boat strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and ingestion of hooks and lines. At Stingray City, a shallow lagoon off Grand Cayman where large numbers of stingrays gather around boats of tourists that feed them, handling by those tourists had causedskin abrasionson the rays. Fed animals begin to equate humans with food, and can exhibit increased aggressiveness toward people, which has resulted in human injuries and even death. People have been bitten while feeding wild animals, some of which carryinfectious diseasessuch as rabies, bubonic plague, or Hantavirus. Feeding wildlife can change the animals’ activity levels and metabolic rates, reduce the size of their home range, and increase both intra- and inter-species aggression. Sharks, for example, don’t naturally share territory, and when they group around boats to feed, it can cause stress and shark-on-shark conflict. “Sharks are solitary predators not normally found in groups,” George Burgess, director of theFlorida Program for Shark Research, told mental_floss. “With feeding, they associate humans in the water—and even the sound of a motor boat—with food, and come from long distances away. Most don’t go far away once the boat leaves, but hang out in the area knowing the boat comes every day, so the reality then is sharks in unusually high densities.” Unnaturally high numbers of predators in one place equals equally unnaturally high levels of predation, which affects the ecology of the entire area. Whitetip reef sharks that are fed in order to attract them for tourists showed elevated activity levels andincreased metabolic ratesduring times they normally would rest. Metabolism influences most of an animal’s biological and ecological processes, so this represents clear evidence of feeding affecting the sharks’ critical biological functions. Researchers found that the rays at Stingray City have distinctly differentpatterns of activitythan their wild counterparts. Wild stingrays forage at night across large distances and rarely encounter each other. The fed rays form schools, feed together, and mate year-round rather than during a specific season. They also show signs of unusual aggression, such as biting each other. Scientists don’t yet know whether these behavior changes could be harmful in the long run. In Slovenia, where bears are fed corn year-round, scientists found that the animals shortened the number of days ofhibernationby as much as 56 percent. Bears regularly visited feeding sites throughout the winter, increasing their likelihood of interactions with other species as well as humans. On some islands in the Bahamas and throughout the Caribbean, tourist operators take people to feed grapes, ground beef, and other foods to one of the world's most endangered lizards, northern Bahamian rock iguanas.Researchers reporteddifferent levels of calcium, cholesterol, and various minerals in fed versus unfed populations of the iguanas, as well as diarrhea, higher levels of glucose, and a staggering 100 percent endoparasitic infection rate in the tourist-fed animals. One of the study’s authors, Charles Knapp of the Chicago John G. Shedd Aquarium, recommends an education campaign to discourage iguana feeding and, at a minimum, using food specially formulated for the iguanas. In another devastating example, people frequently feed bread, popcorn, and fast food towhite ibisin parks in Georgia. As a result, the birds are more sedentary than normal, and they come into contact with ducks, gulls, and city birds they normally wouldn’t encounter. Increased inter-species contact, combined with higher levels of stress hormones and weaker immune systems, could increase the spread of pathogens such as salmonella among them. A previous study found ibises infected with strains of salmonella that also make people sick—because of their range, the birds could move these pathogens over large distances. All U.S. national parks prohibit the feeding of wildlife. But in some parks, bears have learned to forage forunattended human food. Rangers relocate these bears away from human food sources, but many eventually return and continue seeking human food—eventually, such problem bears must be euthanized. Being fed from cars can cause bears and other animals to congregate near roads where they may be killed by vehicles. Hanging around roads and parking lots can also make animals such as squirrels, birds, and deer easier for predators to catch. Tourists on Fraser Island, Australia have come to expect interaction withdingoes, including feeding the wild dogs. As numbers of tourists increased, so have reports of dingo attacks, and after a human fatality in April 2001, the government ordered acull of the dingoes. Fed sharks lose their natural fear of humans and become bolder, coming closer than they normally would once they associate humans with food. When bites result, it contributes to the negative image sharks can have, Burgess says. “The sharks get the blame, not the humans in the water with bait and fish. We have a designation in the shark attack file, 'Provoked Attack,' meaning ones in which humans initiated the attack by doing something to provoke the animal. What is more provocative than dangling fish in front of a shark’s nose? Of course, the wordprovokeddoesn’t appear in the headline. Whatever advantage is gained in conservation by letting people see what beautiful animals sharks are gets cancelled out by the headlines of someone getting bit.” In response to shark bites, officials sometimes kill sharks in the area where the encounter occurred even though, Burgess says, the chances of killing the specific shark involved are slim to none. He notes that feeding can result in shark deaths another way: “There have been examples where fishermen came to areas where sharks were attracted by a feeding operation and fished them out."""

The authors of a forthcoming studysayEuropeans alone ingest about 11,000 microscopic pieces of plastic apiece every year. And unless we make some very big changes, that number could reach 780,000 pieces per person within a few decades. Microplastics, also known as microbeads, are popular additives to a wide range of personal care products, from face wash to toothpaste. We rinse them off and send them down the drain, where they head out into the water supply. And there they’ll stay, absorbing chemicals, until something or somebody comes along and eats them. Studies havefoundthat fish that consume microbeads are smaller than others. Theyreject real foodin favor of more plastic. Their eggs are less likely to hatch, and hatchlings are less likely to escape predators. Researchers at the University of Ghent in Belgium have beenstudyingthe effects of microplastics on shellfish like mussels, oysters, and clams, all of which are filter feeders. The average mussel sucks in and spits out about 20 liters of water per day. Most of the plastic particles in that water will be filtered and sent back out into the ocean. Most, but not all; lead researcher Colin Janssen says the mussels they examined had an average of one tiny plastic fragment apiece. Janssen and his colleagues say the same process occurs in humans who consume shellfish. About 99 percent of the microplastic will pass through your system. That still leaves 1 percent to stay in the body, and we don’t yet know what that means for our health. “We do need to know the fate of the plastics,” JanssentoldSky News. “Where do they go?

The swishing-arrow design is, of course, the widely-recognized symbol for recycling. But what do those numbers inside the logo mean? Business Insiderrecently helped clarify things. The stamp is a Resin Identification Code, or RIC, and the numbers indicate exactly what type of plastic is being used for that particular container: “1,” for example, is polyethylene terephthalate, a linguistic nightmare of a plastic typically found in soda bottles and peanut butter jars. High-density polyethylene is designated “2,” a sturdier plastic that can accommodate heavier products like a gallon of milk or laundry detergent. Low-density polyethylene (“4”), in contrast, is pretty flimsy, and you’ll typically find it used for grocery bags or shrink-wrap. The series goes up to “7,” which indicates a mixture of plastics being used. The codes help local recycling centers sort their returns and indicates to consumers which containers can be turned in. Not all centers are equipped to deal with every type of plastic,especially PVC, or “3” and “7,” which can be found in everything from sunglasses to bulletproof material.

524,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/90796/8-surprising-facts-about-deepest-part-ocean,,"The deepest part of ouroceans, the region from below 20,000 feet to the very bottom of the deepest sea trench, is known as the hadal zone. It's named after Hades, the underworld ofGreek mythology(and its god). The majority of the hadal zone is made up of plunging trenches formed by shifting tectonic plates. To date, some46 hadal habitatshave been identified—about 41 percent of the total depth range of the entire ocean, and yet less than one quarter of 1 percent of the entire ocean. Scientists still know very little about this mysterious and difficult-to-study region, but what we have learned is astounding. Theworld’s tallest mountain(measured from sea level) would fit inside the deepest sea trench on Earth, theMariana Trench, with a few miles to spare. This helps explain why it has been so rarely explored—just over 20 people have been to the bottom. The trenches of the hadal deep are so remote that getting equipment or people to such depths is extremely difficult. This is compounded by the fact that the underwater pressure at that depth—approximately 8 tons per square inch, roughly that of100 elephants standing on your head—causes ordinary instruments to implode. Scientists venturing so far down require special equipment that can withstand the immense pressure, but even those can be unreliable. In 2014, the remote unmanned subNereusbecame the latest in a long line of research probes to be lost during a mission. Nereus was built by Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and had completed several ground-breaking missions into the hadal zone, including in 2009 when it reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench. But during its last mission, into the Kermadec Trench just off New Zealand, the subbroke apart, likely because of the intense water pressure. To measure the very deepest parts of the ocean, scientists usebomb sounding, a technique where TNT is thrown into the trenches and the echo is recorded from a boat, allowing scientists to estimate the depth. While some question the sensitivity of the method, even the rough results are impressive: So far, in addition to the Mariana Trench, four other trenches—the Kermadec, Kuril-Kamchatka, Philippine, and Tonga, all in the Western Pacific Ocean—have been identified as deeper than 10,000 meters (32,808 feet). The first expedition to take samples from the hadal zone was the trailblazingHMSChallengerExpeditionfrom 1872 to 1876. Scientists on board managed to extract samples from 26,246 feet beneath the ocean’s surface, but weren’t able to confirm if the samples came from animals that inhabited those depth or those that had died and sunk down to the bottom. It was not until 1948 that a Swedish research vessel, theAlbatross, was able to collect samples from 25,000 feet and show that the hadal zone was inhabited. In 1956,Jacques Cousteautook the first photograph of the hadal zone. Cousteau submerged his camera to the seafloor of the Romanche Trench in the Atlantic Ocean, some 24,500 feet down, providing the first glimpse of this previously unseen part of the ocean. Studying the creatures that survive in the hadal zone can be very challenging. Prior to 2008, most species were described from just one sample, often in a poor state. (One scientist described most hadal samples as “shriveled specimens in museums.”) In 2008, in a huge leap toward understanding deep sea creatures, the first images of live organisms from the hadal zone were recorded. The Japanese research vesselHakuho-Marudeployed a freefall baited lander in the Japan Trench in the Pacific Ocean, becoming the first scientists to produce images of live hadal creatures there. The camera caught pictures of hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis), which are thought to be the most prevalent species at hadal depths. The images surprisingly showed swarms of active fish feeding on tiny shrimp—overturning ideas that fish at this depth would be solitary, sluggish creatures barely eking out an existence. A2016 paperwent on to identify live snailfish at a depth of 26,722 feet—the deepest confirmed sighting of a live specimen. Recent expeditions such as theHADES projectin the Pacific suggest that fish are not found below 27,560 feet. But the hadal zone extends to 36,000 feet. Marine biologistPaul Yanceyhypothesized that fish reach a limit around 27,500 feet because proteins at such great depths cannot build properly. To counteract this, deep-sea fish have developed an organic molecule known as trimethylamine oxide, or TMAO (this molecule also gives fish their “fishy” smell), which helps proteins work at high pressure. Shallow water fish have fairly low levels of TMAO, while deep sea fish have increasingly high levels. Yancey proposed that the amount of TMAO required to counteract the huge pressure below 27,560 feet would be so great that water would begin to flow uncontrollably through their bodies, killing the fish. Below 27,560 feet however, other types of creatures do exist, such as shrimp-likehadal amphipods. These creatures scavenge on the waste and dead bodies from sea creatures which float down from above. In the 1970s, tons of toxic pharmaceutical waste was disposed into the Puerto Rico Trench. Puerto Rico was a large producer of pharmaceuticals, and the dumping was allowed as a temporary measure while a new wastewater treatment site was built. But delays meant that dumping continued at the site into the 1980s. Samples taken from the dump site indicated that ecosystems were seriously damaged by the pollutants, with a1981 studyrevealing “demonstrable changes in the marine microbial community in the region used for waste disposal.” Creatures that thrive in extreme environments such as the hadal zone are calledextremophiles. These creatures can withstand very low temperatures, high pressures, and little or no oxygen. Studying these extraordinary animals can lend great insights to scientists, indicating how life might persist in space where no oxygen is present. Microorganisms such asPyrococcus CH1have been found in deep sea vents, giving scientists an idea of the type of life that could exist on celestial bodies such as Jupiter’s moon Europa. Alicella gigantea, a deep-sea amphipod whose common name is “supergiant,” is at least 20 times the size of its shallower-dwelling cousins. This makes them sound huge—but they’re actually miniscule creatures related to the sand hopper, a tiny beast often found popping out of seaweed at the beach at high speed. The largest specimen ofsupergiantever found was a 13.4-inch female, found in a trench in the Pacific Ocean. A version of this story ran in 2017; it has been updated for 2022."

The kilometer-long, 328-foot-deep chasm has been growing since the 1960s as the result of climate change. As the permafrost thaws and softens, large sections of soil collapse, revealing a wealth of bizarre geological and biological material. Extreme weather events like flooding have accelerated the process. The crater is now gobbling up another 33 to 98 feet of tundra per year, emitting enormous booming sounds as large clods of soil fall in. It sounds like the stuff of nightmares, but it’s also a scientist’s dream: a ready-made window into the world below the surface, going back hundreds of thousands of years. “Its size is amazing,” researcher Julian MurtontoldtheSiberian Times. “The crack itself is perfectly exposed, uncovered, all the layers are perfectly visible and can be thoroughly studied.” Initial estimates put the soil in the deepest part of the chasm at around 120,000 years old, but Murton’s analysis of plant matter in the dirt found it was probably closer to 200,000 years. The soil and its contents are a rich record of local life, including two wood-rich layers that Murton and his colleagues believe were once forests. Additional exploration of the chasm has yielded the bodies of bison, horses, elks, mammoths, and reindeer, as well as a 4400-year-old foal, all beautifullypreservedby the region’s year-round blistering cold.

The pilot project will test not only the energy efficiency of the panels, but the environmental impact on the ecosystem below, since the system will block out light over that stretch of water. It will also reduce water evaporation from the reservoir to some extent, which might change the efficiency of the solar panels by cooling them down. By the end of the year, it should be powering part of the national energy grid—three years after the project was originally due to go online. After the six-month pilot, ChannelNews Asia reports, two of the different photovoltaic systems will be tested on a larger scale. The first phase systems will continue to be operational for three to six years, though, along with the phase two systems. Singapore is considered amodelforgreen initiativesin Asia, especially with regard to environmentally friendly buildings. However, while the new floating solar panel testing is the largest pilot in the world, it’s not the first.Similar projectsalready exist in Australia, India, and the U.S., and Japanis poisedto install a record 50,904 panels over a reservoir within two years. But the floating systems are especially relevant to Singapore, a geographically small city-state surrounded by water. “Given our geography, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are a key technology in Singapore’s efforts to harness renewable energy,” Zulkifli said in his speech on October 25. “Floating PV systems, i.e. those installed over our water bodies, not only help to overcome land constraints, but also have the potential to reduce evaporative losses from our reservoirs.” [h/tInhabitat] Know of something you think we should cover?

Without even realizing it, you’ve decided to redirect your attention from sounds to sights. Now imagine that your passenger has interfered. They’ve turned the radio all the way up and opened all the windows, filling the car with the roar of traffic and wind as you’re trying to focus. Harder now, isn’t it? And it isn’t just us; scientists say mongooses exposed to traffic noise overlook crucial clues from their other senses—clues that could mean the difference between life and death. Theirfindingswere published today in the journalCurrent Biology. We’ve known for a long time that pollution and urbanization are bad news for everyone. Much of our research has focused on the physical effects like smog, water contamination, and habitat destruction. We haven’t paid too much attention to the toxic effects oftoo much noiseuntil recently, but what we’ve learned is troubling. Studies have shown that exposure to anthropogenic, or human-made, noise causes intense stress for animals, caninterferewith their communication, and may even keep them frommigratingandhaving sex. All of these issues could mess with a species’ chances of survival in the long run. The short-term effects have been less understood, says biologist Amy Morris-Drake of the University of Bristol. She and her colleagues decided to test the immediate consequences of noise on one species, the dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula), whose South African habitat is increasingly bounded by cities and roads. The dwarf mongoose has many predators, including jackals, hyenas, civets, servals, honey badgers, wildcats, bigger mongooses, and an assortment of reptiles. The key to survival, consequently, is constant olfactory vigilance: sniffing the air for the scent of predator poop. The research team headed into mongoose territory with audio recordings of traffic noise and Ziploc baggies of poop from servals, wildcats, and giraffes. (Because giraffes present no threat to mongooses, their poop was used as a control group.) The researchers set out the poop and played their road sounds, watching the mongooses to see how they would respond. The results were not encouraging. Exposure to traffic noises significantly decreased the mongooses’ vigilance. They spent less time investigating the predator poop; they were less likely to scan the area for potential threats; and they were less likely to retreat to the entrance of their burrow to prepare for an attack. If the scientist-provided poop, and therefore the threat, had been real, those mongooses would have found themselves in significant danger. ""Our study suggests that noise pollution can have a negative effect in terms of information use,” said co-author Andy Radford. “Given the demonstrated effects, considering the interactions among multiple sensory channels is critically important if we are to understand fully the consequences of human-induced environmental change.""Know of something you think we should cover?

In some places, that change happens fast. Geologists say chalk cliffs on England’s southern shore are eroding 10 times faster than they once did. The researchers published their findings in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The picturesque chalk cliffs known as the Seven Sisters swoop gracefully along the British coast, attracting tourists and photographers. Yet for their serene appearance, the cliffs are not exactly safe. Chalk is one of the softest minerals and easily broken—especially when it’s being constantly pounded by the sea. The site saw major landslides in 1999 and 2001, and amassive cliff-fallin May 2016 sent tons of rock into the water below. (“While we would encourage people to enjoy the beautiful coastline of East Sussex,"" reads the Seven Sisters Country Parkwebsite, “we would remind visitors that you do have a duty of care and responsibility for your own safety.”) Understanding coastal erosion has become a big issue in a world facing rising sea levels. The tricky part is studying something that, by definition, is no longer there. Even tons of fallen rock will break down and be scattered by the sea. But the ghosts of the old coastline still haunt the rock that remains. To find them, geologists used a technique calledcosmogenic nuclide dating, which measures the extent of cosmic radiation in rock to determine its age and how long it’s been exposed. This, in turn, can paint a picture of how that rock has moved or been changed over time. The white cliffs are studded with pieces of hard, chemically inert flint—a rock that makes a far more reliable historical witness than soft chalk. Working perpendicular to the cliffs themselves, the researchers pulled chunks of flint from exposed rock in a line beginning at the cliff and ending near the water’s edge. They crushed the flint into microscopic pieces, then put them through a cosmogenic nuclide array to determine their age and history. Next, the researchers fed that data into a mathematical model of the coastline, which allowed them to estimate the cliffs’ rate of erosion going back thousands of years. They found that the coast is indeed crumbling fast—but they also learned that this pace is a relatively recent development. For most of the cliffs’ history, the authors write in their paper, the rate of erosion held steady at between 2 and 6 centimeters per year. But that rate has accelerated mightily in the last few centuries, now cruising along at 22 to 32 centimeters a year. What changed (or changed more)? The authors can’t say for sure. Natural climate change is one possibility; wave action did become more violent during the so-called Little Ice Age, which took place from the 14th to 19th centuries. The cliffs have also become more vulnerable over the last few centuries, as ocean currents and human engineers picked away at the band of sediment protecting the coast from the ocean’s full force."

Resident Richard Conlin snapped photos of the small white octopus lying on the wet parking deck andshared themon Facebook. After the photos were taken, Conlin wrote, building security scooped the octopus into a bucket, walked out to the ocean, andtossed the critter back. Improbable? Absolutely—but not as improbable as it once was. The apartment building is locatedright on the beach. Its drains and pipes are connected to the ocean, and unusually high tides can and do wash onto the parking deck’s concrete floors. Sometimes those tides bear passengers. Biologist Kathleen Sullivan Sealey of the University of Miami says the octopus was likely either a Caribbean reef octopus or an Atlantic pygmy octopus, and that it may have been following a school of fish through the drainage system when it came out the other side. With their soft bodies, octopuses arevery skilledat squeezing through small spaces. Thistalentcan make them very hard to contain, but, as we see here, it can also land them in some pretty strange places. Sealey told theMiami Heraldthat we can expect more and more marine visitors assea levelscontinue to rise. In the last 10 years alone, flooding in Miami Beach hasincreased by 400 percent. “The sea is moving in,” she said, “so we have to share the space.”"

Image credit: iStock Pollution isn’t just a problem for overcrowded cities and highways jam-packed with exhaust-spewing cars. Even remote, rural areas are experiencing air quality issues. In fact, according to a recent World Health Organization (WHO)report, 92 percent of the world’s population is now exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution. Using satellite measurements, air transport models, and ground station monitors, the WHO collected data on air quality in more than 3000 urban and rural locations around the world. They identified areas with unsafe levels of particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. This type of particulate matter includes pollutants like sulfate, nitrates, and black carbon, and is considered especially dangerous for human respiratory health. They found that 92 percent of people live in areas where air pollution exceeds the WHO’s ambient air quality guidelines. The pollution levels around the world can be seen on an interactive map on the WHO’swebsite. The WHO also collected data on pollution-related deaths. They found that 6.5 million deaths (or 11.6 percent of all global deaths) in 2012 alone could be linked to indoor and outdoor air pollution. Meanwhile, they note, around 3 million deaths a year are related to outdoor air pollution, with 90 percent of air pollution–related deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. While these findings are extremely concerning, the WHO's Maria Neira, director of the Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health, claims that countries can begin to reduce air pollution by implementing a range of sustainable practices. ""Fast action to tackle air pollution can’t come soon enough,"" shesays. ""Solutions exist with sustainable transport in cities, solid waste management, access to clean household fuels and cook-stoves, as well as renewable energies and industrial emissions reductions.""

533,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/87341/7-easy-ways-you-can-help-bees-right-now,,"At this point, most people are well aware that the bees are in trouble. Last week, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officially placed seven species of Hawaiian yellow-faced bees on theendangered species list. They believe their decline in population is the result of a long list of threats to the species, including predation, habitat loss, and human involvement. Bees are pollinators and crucial to our ecosystem; we depend on them for much of our produce. Around 30 percent of the world's crops rely on cross-pollination [PDF]. If you want to help the tiny buzzing insects from dying out completely, here are some small things you can do. Bees are steadily losing ground in our modern culture. Flowers and gardens are dwindling, meaning less and less food for the hungry bees. You can help protect the species right in your own backyard by starting a bee-centric garden. Plant flowering plants native to your area with a preferencetoward single flower topslike marigolds, tulips, and daisies. Double flower tops and hybridized plants don't yield the same level of nectar as single flowers tops, so it's harder for bees to reach the pollen. You should also try to have something flowering all year, so make a calendar for your garden that includes flowers in spring, summer, and fall. Once your bees have something to eat, you can build a potential home for the visitors. Leave a place in your garden open for bees to burrow, and add some branches or bamboo for wood-nesting bees. And always remember to only use natural pesticides and fertilizers that won't harm the bees who stop by. Controlling gardeners are going to have to loosen their iron grip for the sake of the bees; a healthy collection of dandelions and clovers can actually do a world of good. The leafy intruders—along with various wildflowers—offer substantial and much-needed nutrients. Dandelions in particularare extremely beneficialto bees, as well as other pollinators like butterflies, beetles, and hoverflies. Because these yellow weeds flower between March and May, they're ready to be pollinated just as the bugs are waking up from hibernation. Each flowering dandelion can have up to 100 florets, meaning plenty of food for your buzzing buddies. Laying off the pesticides will also keep the air poison-free and more accessible to bugs who would like to visit. Buying honey and other bee products from a local beekeeper is a great way to support local pollination. As long as the beekeeper knows what they're doing, they won't harm or disturb the bees in any meaningful way. Often bees make asurplus of honey, so they won't notice if we take some for ourselves. Beeswax is used to coat the honeycombs and is either sliced off by the beekeeper to get to the honey or burrowed through by the bees in the winter—either way it's discarded, so it would be a waste not to use it. It turns out bird baths aren't just great for birds. Bees need water just like all animals, so they seek out shallow puddles and bird baths to quench their thirst. You can get a bird bath or leave out a small saucer to help hydrate the bees in your neighborhood. Bees like to share information, so if you keep your water source consistent, the local pollinators will get wiseand come visit. Just make sure to include a small rock or other object for them to perch on while they drink—bees are unfortunately not equipped with tiny floaties. There are plenty of products on the market that will help you help bees. If planting a full garden is too much work, you can opt forseed bombs. The little clusters of seeds can be tossed in areas like your backyard or an empty lot where they'll eventually turn into a colorful patch of wildflowers. You can also tryseed moneyorpencilsthat can be planted in the ground to grow flowering and edible plants. Another option is to look into getting a Flow Hive. After an extremelysuccessful Indiegogo campaign, the simplified beehive is availablefor purchase. The honey comes from a tap, making the extraction process easier for humans and bees alike. Feeling committed? There are plenty of ways you can give your time to helping the bees. You can host a bee hive and agree to have abee blocksituated in your backyard. TheNew York Beekeepers Associationoffers a program where people can offer up available yards or rooftops to keep hives for urban beekeepers. The program matches people up to help encourage more hives in the city. You can also volunteer to join theBack Yard Beekeepers Association. The Connecticut-based group provides information for fledgling beekeepers and organizes educational programs for the community."
534,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/88702/scientists-say-bird-poop-helps-cool-arctic,,"You just never know how your contributions will change the world. In the case of Arctic birds, those contributions are drippy and white. Poop. We’re talking about poop. A recent study found that gases produced by huge quantities of seabird guano can increase cloud cover, thereby slightly reducing air temperature. The study results were published in the journalNature Communications. Climate change is a serious issue all over the globe, but it’s especially pronounced at the poles, where glaciers are vanishing and ecosystems are shifting at a dramatic rate. Understanding the many factors effecting these changes is essential if we want to protect our planet. Some factors, like a damaged ozone layer, are fairly obvious. Others are a little stealthier. Take those bird droppings, for example. The Arctic is home to dozens of bird species and millions of birds, and they’ve all got to poop somewhere. Theirrunny poop—actually a combination of urine and feces—dribbles down the walls of their cliffside dwellings, accumulating in puddles and streaks. Animals have excretory systems in order to get rid of materials they don’t need. We simply push them out of our bodies into the world around us. But the story doesn’t end there. The contents of our wastealter the environment they enter, often imperceptibly. The uric acid in bird poop, for example, releases ammonia (NH3) into the air. A few years ago, researchers decided to find out exactly how much NH3 those birds’ butts were making. They conducted a global survey of 261 million breeding pairs of seabirds, thenbuilt a databaselisting the birds’ location and ammonia output. Now, a team of climate and biology researchers from universities in Canada and the U.S. have put the excellent database to a very specific use. They were interested in figuring out if Arctic seabirds in particular were making enough NH3 to affect local weather. To find out, they pulled information on the birds’ productivity, then fed that information into a model that simulated the movement and transformation of ammonia particles in Arctic air. They found that molecules of the birds’ ammonia could influence the growth of new particles, which could then expand and expand until they created new clouds. The clouds, in turn, could reduce the temperature above the bird colonies. Not by a lot, mind you; we’re talking about teeny, tiny changes. But we’re also talking about millions of birds in a swiftly shifting environment. The results highlight just how linked we are to our planet, the authors write. Even as our lives and bodies are touched by the heat and air, we are touching back."
535,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86510/what-can-urban-wildlife-teach-us-about-pollution,,"Pigeons crowd a streetlight in New York City. Image credit: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images When Rebecca Calisi first moved to New York City, she ran into two immediate concerns. First, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene had encouraged her to have her children tested for lead sometime that year, since the state mandates that children under 6 be tested on an annual basis. The idea seemed sensible, given they had moved into one of the city's prewar apartments, which are notoriously full of lead paint. Next, she needed to find a new research subject. As a biologist with a specialty in avian biology, Calisi knew a readily available bird species would be best. And in a city like New York, there’s nothing quite so omnipresent as pigeons. “You could walk outside and sit down on a bench and your subject would come right up to you,” she tellsmental_floss. It was only a short stretch for Calisi to connect the two items on her to-do list—lead levels and pigeons—and before long she was measuring the blood of pigeons from zip codes all over the city. What she found in her survey of 825 birds over five years correlated precisely with data from the city’s health department. Just like human New Yorkers, pigeons are very attached to their neighborhoods. They live in a small area for the majority of their lives, and the birds were exposed to many of the same sources of lead as human residents. Sure enough, her initial results showed that the birds’ blood showed similar levels of contamination. In other words, Calisi found, pigeons were like urban canaries in a coal mine. They were perfect biomarkers for lead contamination. Now an assistant professor in the Department of Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior at the University of California-Davis, Calisi has a new study out in the journalChemospheredetailing her findings [PDF]. The results clearly showed the link between the health of a city’s human inhabitants and its wildlife. As cities and their populations expand, engulfing areas previously left for farmland or untouched wilderness, encounters between humans and wildlife are on the rise. Consider thecoyotes roaming the streets of New York, orbears in citiesall over Southern California. While these confrontations are often framed as antagonistic, viewed through the lens of biological research like Calisi’s, the encounters can actually be mutually beneficial. For example, Calisi says, “If somebody had been monitoring the levels in lead in pigeons in Flint, Michigan, might there have been warning signs before children started getting sick?” Lead isn’t the only hazardous substance studying birds could detect. She hopes to expand her research to investigate other heavy metals, pesticides, pollutants, and fire retardants in other cities as well as more rural populations. Calisi isn’t the only person intrigued by what the animals we live beside can teach us about our environment. Scientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center recently found a link between highway pollution and cardiovascular health. The Rochester-based team took lab rats on a road trip between Rochester and Buffalo. The rats, exposed to the same type of pollution as drivers orpeople living near highways, showed immediate health effects that lasted for up to 14 hours. Their heart rates quickly dropped after exposure to airborne pollutants, and their nervous systems were negatively impacted as well. The study offered new insights into why urban hospitals often seen an uptick inheart attacks on smoggy days. Then there’s the paper that revealed how artificial lights impact the reproductive systems of European blackbirds (Turdus merula). A study by ecologists and evolutionary biologists at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Radolfzell, Germany found that even low intensities of artificial light can alter the timing ofreproductive developmentin songbirds. Birds exposed to light with an intensity even 20 times lower than the light emitted by a normal street lamp developed their reproductive system as much as a month earlier than birds kept in the dark at night. They also molted earlier. For humans living in the incandescent glow of urban areas, artificial light can be just as harmful: Disrupted circadian rhythms are linked from everything tometabolic disordersto an increasedrisk of cancer. A blackbird in Paris. Image credit: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images> If it seems like city life is killing its inhabitants—feathered, furred, and bipedal creatures alike—there’s reason for hope. Urban wildlife don’t just reflect the risks of urban living; their rapid evolution hints at how humans might also change to cope. The pressures are undoubtedly great, but for animals that find ways to adapt, there are numerous opportunities to thrive. In one recent study, ornithologists showed that European blackbirds from cities are farless sensitive to stressthan their rural cousins. The city birds had a much lower hormonal stress response, which scientists hypothesized could be the result of selective pressures in an urban environment. These pressures make up a large part of what Jason Munshi-South, an evolutionary biologist, investigates from his lab at Fordham University. With a collection of students and colleagues, Munshi-South has tracked down white-footed mice [PDF] in slivers of parks throughout the city, as well as salamanders and rats. Creatures this small can roam throughout the city and incorporate human infrastructure into their daily needs—though, like pigeons, they tend to stick to a small home area. White-footed mice and salamanders have found a way to exist in tiny pockets of wilderness, surrounded by the rush of 8 million people. And those challenges have led to some surprising rapid adaptations. “They’ve evolved to eat different diets, to deal with pollution. Their overall life history may evolve if populations are crowded—they’ll have offspring at a younger age. Those are the things we found with white-footed mice,” Munshi-South explains tomental_floss. “With rats, similar things are going to apply. You’ll see adaptations in the skeleton for living in different structural environments.” For example, he says, “You have a lot of rats in New York City living in underground infrastructure and coming up and down, not burrowing into the ground.” A white-footed mouse. Image credit: Charles Homler viaWikimedia Commons//CC BY-SA 3.0 Genetic tests on the rodents have revealed that these changes extend even into the animals’ genomes. Munshi-South said they found evidence that the city critters are becoming distinct from their country relatives simply because of the extreme pressures to survive. And while the differences aren’t yet large enough to separate the two groups into distinct species, it’s a possibility in the future. The ability of these animals to adapt and thrive in city environments—to live alongside humans and even act as early warning systems for certain pollutants—might seem to suggest that nature will triumph in the face of human progress. But neither Calisi nor Munshi-South are particularly optimistic when it comes to conservation. “I guess we’re lucky that some species can live in cities and adapt, since most of them can’t,” said Munshi-South. “But I don’t think we’ve figured out a good way to use urbanization as a tool to prevent broader habitat loss yet.” Calisi just hopes that the species whodomanage to build niches in cities will stop being regarded as nuisances or invaders. Instead, she says, we should view them as partners—and acknowledge that we’re all in this rat race together."
536,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86371/feral-cats-are-key-contributors-sixth-mass-extinction,,"A new analysis of global extinction trends might make your cat’s hunting habits sounda lot less endearing. AsGizmodoreports, new research found that free-roaming cats played a key role in the demise of at least 63 species of mammals, reptiles, and birds over the past 500 years. The study, which was published in the journalPNAS, looked at data from sources like the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List. The research shows just how much invasive predators are contributing to thesixth mass extinction, something scientists have long been aware of but didn’t have the global numbers for until now. Feral cats are some of guiltiest offenders, accounting for 26 percent of the extinctions; they're bested only by rodents, which were found to be behind at least 75 extinctions (30 percent). While dogs haven’t been quite as disastrous for the environment, they’re far from innocent. The paper links man’s best friend to the extinction of almost a dozen species. In addition to cats, dogs, and rodents, other major threats to vulnerable species include pigs, red foxes, and the small Indian mongoose. Over half of all bird, mammal, and reptile extinctions in the past few centuries can be traced back to such invasive predators. To deal with the bloodthirsty behavior of felines specifically, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center director Dr. Peter Marra toldBBC Radio 4 Todaythat hesuggestsbanning all cats from wandering outside without a leash. That solution isn't as unheard of as you might think: Similar bans have been proposed inAustraliaandNew Zealandin the past. [h/tGizmodo] Know of something you think we should cover?

Countless researchers and support staff have died in the pursuit of knowledge that could protect vulnerable places and species, and enable people to live safer, healthier lives. Journalist Richard Conniff, author ofThe Species Seekers, has compiled a “Wall of the Dead” on his blog to memorializescientists, naturalists, and conservationists killed in the field. We’ve picked out just a handful of the dozens of names from that list. They are people whose passion and dedication to their profession ultimately cost them their lives. In some cases, they anticipated the risks. In others, they most definitely did not. Visit Conniff's full list for a fascinating, and often somber, dive into the lives of these explorer-naturalists. Margarita Metallinou, a 29-year-old evolutionary biologist andherpetologist, had been working in Zambia’s Kafue National Park, studying the impacts of climate change on the area’s reptiles. While in the field with two colleagues one afternoon, she suddenly spotted an elephant charging toward them. Her scream warned the others, who were able to outrun the elephant. But Metallinou wastrampled to death. Who killed Dian Fossey? The 53-year-old American primatologist studied and protected mountain gorillas on the Rwandan side of the border with a passionate love and ferocity that no one disputes earned her many enemies. Yet her 1985 murder in the Virunga Mountains remains unsolved more than 30 years later. Fossey was known forconfronting poachers, even going so far as to kidnap the child of a tribesman who had snatched a baby gorilla (both the child and gorilla were returned unharmed). One of Fossey’s student researchers and a former employee were ultimately charged with her murder. The student fled back to the United States; convicted in absentia by a Rwandan court after only a 40-minute trial, he has long insisted that he was a scapegoat. The tracker was later found hanged in his jail cell. But other theories emerged in the years following her death that cast suspicion on political elites involved in animal trafficking and those threatened by her opposition to ecotourism, which she feared would be detrimental to the endangered gorillas. Fossey is often credited with bringing the plight of the mountain gorillas to the public. Through her research and engagement with media, she generated sympathy for gorillas and showed people that they were not the savage, violent beasts they’d been portrayed as, butcurious, human-like creatures. Fossey’s legacy continues in the nonprofit conservation organization she founded, theDian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. Three years after her murder, Fossey’s story was brought to the big screen in the 1988 filmGorillas in the Mist, starring Sigourney Weaver. A leading 19th-century ornithologist, John Cassin described nearly200 bird species, several of which bear his name. Heauthored several volumeson birds identified in his travels, from North America to Chile to Japan. Cassin was a methodical taxonomist, working tirelessly as curator of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. He died at 55—not due to some misadventure in the field, but from arsenic poisoning, the result of decades of handling bird skins preserved with the chemical. In some places, conservation work is inherently dangerous. That’s certainly the case for the Congolese park rangers who protect endangered gorillas inVirunga National Parkas violence flares endlessly around them. Since the 1994 Rwandan genocide prompted more than a million refugees to flee across the border and plunged the Congo into conflict, the park has been caught between armed groups seeking control of territory and generating revenue from deforestation, illegal crops, and poaching. The rangers here do what’s been described as themost dangerous conservation job in the world: At least 140 have been killed in the past two decades, while hundreds more park staff and their families have been displaced. One of those killed was Safari Kakule, a young ranger who colleagues say showed the characteristic dedication of Virunga rangers determined to defend imperiled gorillas and other vulnerable wildlife despite low wages and constant danger. In 2009, rebels attacked a ranger station in a section of the park that served as a refuge for 18 endangered eastern lowland gorillas. They killed the 33-year-old Kakule, shownhereobserving a male gorilla in the field the year before his death. Jean Baptiste Charcot left his career as a physician to become an oceanographer and polar explorer; this transition was made easier by the inheritance he had received from his father. At a time when interest in the polar regions was increasing, Charcot made several expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic. He charted South Pole islands and led a series of summer expeditions to the Arctic. In September 1936, at age 69, he was shipwrecked off the coast of Iceland during a storm. Only one man survived; Charcot perished along with more than 30 others. Millions of fans know conservationist Joy Adamson from her 1960 bestselling memoirBorn Freeand its subsequent film adaptation. The book and film chronicle how Adamson and her game-warden husband, George, raised an orphaned lion cub at a Kenyan national park and eventually reintroduced it to the wild to save it from being removed to a zoo. The book and filmhelped shift public opinionabout lions from dangerous predator to noble, imperiled creatures. It also stirred some controversy about the ethics of returning a semi-tamed animal to the wild. Joy Adamson’s life ended violently at 69: she was found murdered at her camp in Lake Naivasha, not far from Nairobi in the Great Rift Valley. A former employee, a teenager named Paul Nakware Ekai, confessed and was convicted of the crime. Almost a quarter of a century later, Ekaiclaimed he had acted in self-defenseafter Adamson shot him in the leg. He claimed he had been tortured into confessing. But the following year, Ekai changed his story again, denying any involvement in the murder. Nine years later, her husband and his two Kenyan assistants wereshot and killedby poachers who ambushed their Land Rover. For most of the 20th century, federal predator control programs all but eliminated mountain lions [PDF] from Yellowstone National Park. But by the 1990s, a small mountain lion population had reestablished itself in the park. Gregory Felzien, a 26-year-old biologist, was part of a University of Idaho team studying the lions. He was killed in February 1992—not by a lion, but in an avalanche. Felzien had snowshoed to the base of Mount Norris in pursuit of a radio-collared mountain lion he was studying. According to the bookDeath in Yellowstone, Felzien paused in a steep drainage when the avalanche, 100 yards long, 10 yards wide and five feet deep, buried most of his body. He died before rescuers reached him. Roman military commander and naturalist Pliny the Elder produced several major writings, the most famous of which is the 37-volumeNatural History. This expansive set of texts includes vast explorations of astronomy, geography, zoology, botany, geology, and medicine. The encyclopedic collection was a mixture of fact, observation, and superstition, but for centuries it was considered the authoritative text on the sciences (until the scientific method called into question its more speculative conclusions). Pliny was commanding a fleet in the Bay of Naples in 79 CE when word arrived of a strange cloud emanating from Mount Vesuvius a short distance away. It turned out to be the massive volcanic eruption that destroyed the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Pliny took to the shore to investigate and rescue a friend. He was killed by the powerful volcanic gases (orpossiblya heart attack). He was 56. On the fateful September day in 1986 when Noel Kempff Mercado landed in the Amazon Basin near the Bolivian border with Brazil, he and his colleagues thought they’d arrived at an abandoned air strip. The 62-year-old Mercado was a prominent Bolivian biologist and conservationist. He had traveled to the remote province to explore the newly-designated Huanchaca National Park, a vibrant wilderness area that contained anabundance of biodiverse habitatslargely unknown to the outside world. Kempff Mercado had long advocated for its protection. But the abandoned airstrip turned out to be a cocaine factory, and its guardskilled Kempff Mercadoalong with a colleague and the pilot of their plane. The incident followed on the heels of scaled-up operations against cocaine labs by Bolivian authorities and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency officials, and there was speculation that the guards had mistaken the men for law enforcement. The murders led to a public outcry, and two years later the park was renamed the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in honor of its fallen champion. In 2000, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. Born and raised in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, Ralph Hoffman moved to California and directed the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History from 1925 to 1932. He was an ornithologist and avid plant collector who made dozens of collecting trips to the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, sometimes dubbed the “North American Galapagos” for their incredible plant diversity and endemism. Hoffmann made many important contributions to the understanding of the islands’ unique ecosystems, and probably would have made many more. But on a summer day in 1932 while collecting on the remote, windswept island of San Miguel, Hoffmann fell to his death from a cliff. The Douglas fir is one of about 80 flora and fauna named for David Douglas, the son of a Scottish stonemason who transcended his humble origins to become ahighly regarded and prolific botanist. He left school at 11 to begin working as a gardener on a series of large estates. At the age of 20, Douglas was appointed to the botanic garden at Glasgow University, where he befriended leading British botanist Sir William Jackson Hooker. He became Hooker’s assistant, and Hooker later got him a job as a botanical collector for the Royal Horticultural Society. Douglas made three collecting trips to the Pacific Northwest and California. In 1833 he sailed to Hawaii, enthusiastic to continue documenting the endemic plants of the islands he had first encountered three years before. It was to be his last expedition. While walking one morning en route to Hilo, Douglas apparently fell into a deep pit covered over with dirt and brush, commonly used at the time to trap wild cows. It appeared that the 35-year-old Douglas, who had poor eyesight, went crashing through, where he was crushed and mauled to death by a bull who had also fallen into the pit. Some have speculated that Douglas was actuallymurdered. Suspicions fell on the shady former convict with whom Douglas had met earlier that day, but the charge remains unproven. Douglas was buried in Honolulu, and the place where he died is now called Kaluakauka, translated as the “doctor’s pit.” There is a memorial to Douglas on the island of Hawaii and in the churchyard of the Scottish village of Scone, where he was born. Fornes was part of a scientific team trying to prevent the spread of bovine rabies by controlling populations of disease-carrying vampire bats. As Fornes was collecting bat specimens roosting in a water well he had treated with cyanide gas, hisgas mask leakedand he fell to his death. For thousands of years, thesaigaantelope have roamed across the harsh terrain of the Eurasian Steppe, migrating by the tens of thousands between summer and winter pastures. Today they are critically endangered, largely due to oil and gas exploration, road construction, the encroachment of domesticated livestock and illegal poaching for their meat and horns, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Uldis Knakis was a young Latvian biologist who devoted his life to studying and protecting the saiga. The week before he turned 31, Knakis was shot and killed by poachers unhappy with his efforts to crack down on illegal saiga hunting. The murderers were never identified. Ferdinand Stoliczka, a Czech paleontologist, geologist, and naturalist, participated in several expeditions to the Himalayas. During a time of heightened tension between the Russian and British Empires, Stoliczka was selected to participate in an enormous diplomatic expedition to Central Asia’s Chinese Turkestan (today the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region) that required thousands of horses and porters. He did not survive this final trip. The expeditionary team succeeded in reaching their destination in Turkestan, but on the way back, the 36-year-old Stoliczka began to feel ill. He had extreme breathing difficulties and terrible headaches that intensified as they reached the barren Karakoram Pass, which straddles India and China at an altitude of 18,000 feet. According to accounts from others in his party, Stoliczka had frequently suffered from severe headaches during their mountain journeys. But this time, acute altitude sickness overwhelmed him. He died on the pass and was buried in Tibet. Only 20 years old, amateur herpetologist Keith Clifford Budden was in a remote part of Queensland searching for an extremely venomous snake, thecoastal taipan. The snake is often described as the most dangerous snake in Australia, and although it prefers to slither away, when it feels threatened, it is prone to attack with a series of snapping bites. Budden successfully caught the snake with his bare hands. But as he maneuvered it into a bag, the snake struck his hand. The following day he died from the powerful venom, which attacks the nervous system and interferes with blood’s ability to clot. Budden’s death was not completely in vain, however: researchers were able to “milk”—extract venom—from the live snake, a first step in creating the anti-venom necessary to treat victims of the coastal taipan."

The commission was founded in response to growing commercial fishing interest in Antarctic krill—an essential link in the marine food chain. Both krill and plankton are abundant in the near-pristine Ross Sea. Their presence provides food for the tiniest sea creatures, which in turn are eaten by little animals, onward and upward all the way to pods of minke and killer whales. “The Ross Sea is probably the largest ocean wilderness left on our planet,” marine biologist Enric SalatoldNational Geographic. “It is the Serengeti of Antarctica, a wild place full of wildlife such as emperor penguins, leopard seals, minke whales, and killer whales. It's one of these rare places where humans are only visitors and large animals rule.” The sea’s isolation kept it safe for a long time. But as commercial interests enlarge and fuel prices drop, even these frigid waters will need more official forms of protection. The new ruling prohibits fishing in 72 percent of the reserve, while other areas will be open to limited collections for scientific purposes. ""A number of details regarding the MPA are yet to be finalized but the establishment of the protected zone is in no doubt and we are incredibly proud to have reached this point,” Andrew Wright, CCAMLR executive secretary, said in a statement. Protections will go into effect in December 2017 and hold for 35 years. It’s a very welcome development, say conservationists, but it’s also a temporary fix. Rod Downie is the polar program manager for the World Wildlife Fund. “This is a milestone for the conservation of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean,” hetoldNew Scientist.“We want a permanent and enduring agreement for future generations that will safeguard the whales, penguins, seals and thousands of other amazing species that live there.”Know of something you think we should cover?

The UK design firm Larkfleet’s “elevating house,” spotted byTreeHugger, is built to be raised up and down on jacks as necessary. It could allow more housing to be built in areas where flood risk is high,according tothe company. The 71.6-ton steel-frame house could be raised up almost five feet in just five minutes. Water and sewage connections would be flexible enough to extend up to the raised house, and solar panels could provide continued electricity, though the idea is that the residents would evacuate (with the fate of their home somewhat more secure). The ability to withstand flooding could theoretically open more areas in the UK to development, alleviating housing shortages. As TreeHugger’s Lloyd Alter notes, this isn't the only design solution for flood-prone areas. Without sacrificing high-design aesthetics, houses can be built permanently on stilts orotherwise raisedabove the typical flood level, as FEMA recommends [PDF]. Some particularly flood-prone areas in the U.S.,like Baton Rouge, already require elevated construction above the height of flood-level estimates. Plans for Larkfleet’s three-bedroom pilot house are pending approval by a local district council in eastern England, and construction could start as early as 2017. [h/tTreeHugger]"
540,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/88227/future-climate-change-might-ruin-fall-foliage,,"In coming years, leaf peepers might still able to enjoy aroad tripthrough fall foliage—but the display might not look the same. While foliage is notoriously difficult to predict, researchers suggest climate change may dull autumn’s vibrant red and yellow hues. According toNicole Cavender, vice president of science and conservation for Illinois’sMorton Arboretum, unpredictability caused by climate change—including extreme droughts and floods—could reduce the number of leaves on a tree, hindering the spectacle of foliage colors. One bad storm can change the entire year’s outlook for fall foliage. Another effect will be the timing of the leaf change: Warmer temperatures generally cause trees to change colors later in the season. A group of researchers recently studied theeffects of climate change on autumn phenology, or seasonal changes, and found that 70 percent of their study area (the Northern Hemisphere) experienced delayed foliage. Only the arid and semi-arid regions stayed unchanged. Of course, Cavender notes, fall foliage doesn’t hinge on climate alone. Factors like the genetics of a tree, environmental conditions such as wind and strong rains, and the tree’s overall health all play an integral part. While specifics remain up in the air, Cavender predicts that the growing number of frost-free days anticipated in the next 50 years will definitely dull the colors of some of the United States’ most popular fall trees. The sugar maple, for example, known for its vibrant shades of yellow, orange, and red, is expected to decrease in abundance in America’s natural forests by 2100. It’s also one of many species whose natural habitats will shift north due to warming temperatures. The sugar maple isn’t alone: The yellow birch, beloved for its bright yellow fall leaves, will also migrate north—possibly above the Canadian border by the early 22nd century, according toNational Geographic. Trees aren’t the only species which will move as a result of changing climate: The range of insects are also predicted to dramatically change. The ash tree, which typically has yellow, red and even purple leaves in the fall, is particularly sensitive toinsect-borne diseases. One such insect, theemerald ash borerin North America, has been decimating ash trees—although cold winters could help control the epidemic by reducing the insect population, very cold days have decreased by more than 30 percent in the last century, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. These somewhat dire predictions have already changed this fall's display: This year’s extended summer temperatures causedfoliage delaysin popular leaf peeping spots fromMassachusettstoIndiana, among other locations. But there are some things—besides reducing greenhouse gas emissions—that we can do to help. Fall foliage effects—such as colors, vibrancy, and longevity of those colors—varies by type of tree. Cavender says that by planting a diverse assortment of tree species, we can pave the way for colorful autumns well into the future. “As the climate changes, it’s critical to plant the right tree in the right environmental conditions,” Cavender tellsmental_floss. “The more tree diversity you have, the more likely you are to get fall colors every year.”"

Researchers, who published their findings today, September 21, in the journalNature,say our prehistoric ancestors dispersed across the globe in waves, inspired by dramatic changes in the world’s climate. Exactly how and why our distant ancestors found their way through and out of Africa is the subject of much speculation and research. Earlier studies have concluded that Earth’s orbit caused natural and widespread climate changes in the Late Pleistocene epoch 126,000 to 11,000 years ago, and that these changes might have drivenHomo sapiensto scatter and spread across the shifting continents. To test this theory, researchers at the University of Hawaii at Manoa decided to look for clues in the planet’s climate. They created a computer simulation that tracked changes in life—sustaining elements like vegetation, glacier melt, sea level, and temperature—that could have forced humans to get up and go. Their results suggest that early humans did indeed spread in waves. In fact, there were distinct cycles of human exit from Africa, the most significant of which happened around 60,000 years ago, according to the data. Study co-author Tobias Friedrich created this video depicting human dispersal and density from Africa throughout the world from 125,000 years to 1000 years ago. There was one unexpected finding: According to this model, around 80,000 years ago there was a small but rapid human migration into Europe. Unlike the rest of the model’s conclusions, this time estimate conflicts pretty significantly with the archaeological record, which puts the first modern people in Europe no earlier than 45,000 years ago. William Harcourt-Smithis a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History. He was not affiliated with the current study. “This sort of modelling, trying to think about the dispersal of modern humans across the globe in a truly biogeographical sense, is to be applauded,” he toldmental_floss. But Harcourt-Smith is not convinced by the new paper’s pushing back of the first human arrival in Europe by some 35,000 years. The evidence for the first entry occurring about 45,000 years ago is sound, he says: “We know this from the fossil record (modern humans look very different from late Pleistocene Neanderthals) and the distinct archaeological markers found only at modern human sites.” While fascinating, he says, the new paper is “very, very speculative at best” and should be considered a jumping-off point for further research.

AsBloombergreports, Colas SA, a subsidiary of Bouygues, has plans to incorporate super-strong solar panels into pavement around the world. The team has already designed technology capable of collecting solar energy while supporting heavy tractor-trailers overhead. At the apparatus’s core is a regular solar panel. Colas SA’s Wattway unit has reinforced it with several coatings of different plastics to protect the solar cells inside without blocking the Sun's rays. A layer of crushed glass on top keeps cars from sliding. Wiring in the road routes the power directly to the grid. Construction of a test site in Tourouvre in Normandy, France began last month. The kilometer stretch of road includes more than 30,000 square feet of photovoltaics, which are predicted to generate up to 280 kilowatts of energy. According to Wattway, that’s enough electricity to power a year’s worth of public lighting in a town of 5000. In addition to supplementing the power grid, Wattway’s solar roads can also charge electric cars, light billboards, and run hydrogen power plants. Wattway isn’t the first group to come up with the bright idea. Last year, the Missouri Department of Transportation announced plans to buildAmerica’s first public solar roadalong a section of Route 66, and in that same yeara solar bike path in the Netherlandsgenerated enough energy to power homes for year. But this latest project is especially ambitious—after building their next two sites in Canada and the U.S., Wattway has plans to test the technology in Africa, Europe, and Japan. They’re installing panels in 100 test sites over the next year with hopes to have them ready for commercial use by 2018. Before that happens, the group needs to ensure their panels can withstand the weight of traffic. At this point, their panels can hold up beneath an 18-wheeler truck, but Wattway’s chief technology officer Philippe Harelle says they may have worse luck under a snowplow. Cost is another roadblock: Panels used in solar roads are more expensive than the ones used in solar farms. But unlike solar farms, panels embedded in highways take advantage of free space.

543,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/88753/light-therapy-could-help-bees-recover-pesticides,,"The world’s bees are in crisis, beset by a daunting variety of threats. Humans are at least partially responsible for the bees’ decline, but we’re also hoping to be responsible for theirrescue. Now scientists have found one way to protect them. Writing in the journalPLOS One, they report that treating hives with red light can help bees recover from pesticide exposure. About ten years ago, beekeepers began reporting mass die-offs and disappearances from their hives. In many places, it appeared as though the bees had simply been raptured; hive boxes were empty but there were no bodies to be found. One of the first suspects in Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), as it came to be called, was a parasite called the varroa mite. But even the ravenous, invasive mite couldn’t make bees disappear, so scientists began looking for other clues. Their search led them in a number ofdifferent directions, including toward a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids. All pesticides are, by design, bad for bugs, but neonicotinoids have anespecially nasty effecton bees, causing them to forget to eat and even where they live. They also curtail the production of an energy-carrying molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), weakening the bees and keeping them from flying. In light of this information, environmental agencies in some countries havebanned neonicotinoidpesticides altogether. Others are holding out and leaving the bees to fend for themselves. But they’re not completely alone. Researchers at University College London (UCL) have been developing a treatment that may help bees bounce back from pesticide exposure. They knew from previous studies that infrared light could help slow and heal cellular breakdown, so they decided to try it out with sick bees. They set up four hives. For 10 days, the researchers exposed two of the colonies (let’s call them A and B) to a neonicotinoid called imidacloprid, while the other two (C and D) were left alone. During the same period, they exposed hives A and C to infrared light twice a day for 15 minutes. As expected, the poisoned bees in hive B did not fare well. Their survival rate and ATP levels dropped. With no poison and no light treatment, the unmolested inhabitants of hive D were just fine. But so were the bees in hive A. They were hale and hearty, moving around and living their lives as though they’d never been poisoned. The light was clearly doing them good. It also offered a boost to the healthy bees in hive C, whose survival rates were even higher. Co-author Glen Jeffery is a visual neuroscientist at UCL’s Institute of Ophthalmology. He and his team were encouraged by their results, and say a simple infrared light in hive boxes could be all that’s needed. Not only does the light help damaged bees heal, but it can even protect those who have never been exposed. It’s “an effective means of preventing loss of life in case a colony becomes exposed to neonicotinoids,” Jefferysaidin a press statement. “It's win-win."""

The latest: after decades of decline, numbers of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frogs (Rana sierrae) are on the rise in Yosemite National Park. A report on the frogs’ return waspublishedtoday, October 3, in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. One hundred years ago, California’s Sierra Nevada mountains croaked with yellow-legged frogs.R. sierraewas one of the most abundant species around. Then came the habitat destruction. People began stocking naturally fish-less local lakes with non-native fish like trout, which feed on amphibian eggs, tadpoles, and even full-grown frogs. After that came the fungus.Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or Bd, is a parasitic chytrid fungus that gets into frog skin andcauses it to thicken. This might sound like a good thing, but frogs are amphibians. They take in air, water, and nutrients through their porous skin. When that skin ceases to be porous, the resulting lack of oxygen and chemical imbalances can stop their hearts from beating. Mention Bd to any herpetologist if you want to see them shudder. The teeny-tiny fungus haswreaked havocon amphibian species the world over and is believed to be responsible for the decline or extinction of hundreds of species to date. And it only continues to spread. But the power of Bd’s scythe depends on the species it infects. Some frogs, including the American bullfrog and thelowland leopard froghave evolved a resistance to the pathogen, and it seemsR. sierraemay have done the same. In the early waves of chytrid infestation, many frogs fell to the fungus, but others were naturally resistant. In the aftermath, the survivors mated, creating a small butrelatively hardynew community in the middle of Bd territory. Still, even with this toughness, by 1996 more than 93 percent of yellow-legged frogs had vanished from their habitat [PDF]. Things were not looking so good forR. sierrae. But how bad were they, exactly? To find out, researchers analyzed data from more than 7000 frog population surveys conducted across Yosemite National Park between 1993 and 2012. Yosemite comprises 13 percent of the frog’s total range. To their delight, the scientists found that the frogs were, if not completely rebounding, at least hopping back from the brink a bit. Within the 20-year study period,R. sierraepopulations had increased sevenfold. What happened? The study authors aren’t completely sure, but the frogs’ resistance to Bd certainly didn’t hurt. Another big change: people finally stopped putting frog-gobbling non-native fish in the dang waterways. In recent years, habitat loss and chytrid fungus have made the decimation of Earth’s amphibians seem inevitable. But ifR. sierraeis any indication, the authors write, ""some amphibians may be more resilient than is assumed, and with appropriate management, declines of such species may be reversible."" Woo!

The Coradia iLint was unveiled byAlstomat the InnoTrans railway trade fair earlier this month, and when it launches in Germany next year, it will be the first passenger rail service to run on hydrogen power. Many trains currently run on diesel, a fuel that’s been found toemit harmful pollutantsinto the atmosphere. The only byproduct released by the Coradia iLint is steam. A fuel cell onboard converts chemical energy from a large hydrogen tank into electricity. At top speeds, a motor propels the train forward at up to 87 miles per hour. Lithium batteries on the bottom of the car store any leftover energy that’s produced. In addition to running cleanly and quietly, the train will also be carbon-neutral. The hydrogen used to fuel it will be recycled from the waste produced by chemical plants. By using preexisting hydrogen, no additional harm will be inflicted on the environment. The first train won’t go very far and it won’t be visiting any bustling destinations: The initial route is set for a 60-mile stretch of Germany connecting the town of Buxtehude near Hamburg to the beach town Cuxhaven. But that doesn’t make the accomplishment any less significant. For shorter trips, Coradia iLint presents a cleaner alternative to diesel, and a more cost-effective alternative to converting to electric.

Researcher David Cleveland of UC Santa Barbara calculated the environmental impact of home vegetable gardens in California by looking at a range of factors: He considered how much energy would be saved by replacing supermarket produce with homegrown veggies, as well as the impact of composting organic waste and using gray water for garden irrigation. His findings were encouraging, with a few caveats: According to Cleveland, vegetable gardens can help lower greenhouse gas emissions, but only if they’re properly managed. Home farmers need to make sure they’re composting properly or else their organic waste could actually end up emitting, rather than reducing, greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide and methane. However, with care, Cleveland estimates that vegetable gardens could help the state of California meet its 2020 greenhouse gas reduction goals, contributing up to 7.8 percent of its target. While vegetable gardens aren’t for everyone, Cleveland claims they can have plenty of benefits for people willing to put in the effort.

The Solar Power Tree produces amounts of energy comparable to much larger set-ups in a fraction of the area,Inhabitatreports. According to India’s Union Minister for Science & Technology and Earth Sciences,Dr. Harsh Vardhan, about 3.5 acres of land is typically required to generate a single megawatt of solar power. But the Solar Power tree—developed by scientists at the Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute and launched by Dr. Harsh Vardhan in New Delhi this summer—only takes up about 4 square feet of space. The invention consists of structures supporting photovoltaic panels branching out from a central pole and generates up to 5 kilowatts, which is enough energy to light five houses. A traditional solar panel layout would require 400 square feet of land to produce the same amount of power. Because the solar panels on the tree are positioned high off the ground, they’re more efficient than traditional rigs. One solar tree is capable of gathering 10 to 15 percent more energy than the ground-based alternative. It also comes with a built-in battery backup system so it can keep providing energy for up to two hours after the sun goes down. The solar tree’s compact package makes it an appealing option for urban areas and rural regions with limited free space.

A study led by the University of Vermont’sLaura Sonter(who’s taking the selfie in the image above) examined geo-tagged photos uploaded to Flickr, and compared them to maps of conserved lands in Vermont created by the Nature Conservancy. Using photos from 2007 to 2014, the researchers counted the number of people each day who uploaded at least one photo from the specified areas. The research is published inPLOS ONE. From the selfies they found on Flickr, the researchers estimate that conserved lands saw about 3.6 million visits a year—29.1 million in total. At least 5.1 million visitors were from in-state, while 6.3 million came from outside Vermont. The researchers used data on average tourist trip expenditures to extrapolate the estimated income that people seeking out forest recreation areas like state parks brought into Vermont’s tourism department. The average in-state visitor spent $82 a day, while the average out-of-state visitor spent $59, for an estimated $1.8 billion in state revenue over those eight years, due to visits to conserved lands. Using this method, the researchers also hypothesize that you can calculate relative values of different aspects of conserved lands to visitors, like how big the size of the park is, whether there’s opportunity for snow sports or swimming, and the size and proximity to surrounding towns. The study’s method of using Flickr photos to track park visitors is especially useful because most parks and preserves don’t keep accurate counts of people coming and going year-round. Not everyone who visits is going to take a photo, and certainly not everyone is going to upload it to Flickr and tag it with the location, but the method at least provides a way to get an estimated head count. Even if the Flickr method doesn’t include the many visitors who don’t upload their photos to the web, it’s better to know that state parks are worth a bare minimum of $1.8 billion to the tourism economy than to assume that they’re worth less.

A fire whirl (otherwise known as a fire tornado, firenado, orfire devil) occurs when hot air rises quickly from the ground during a wildfire. The awe-inspiring event can be extremely dangerous in nature, but the University of Maryland researchers believe the power of this new type of fire whirl can be harnessed for good. In their paper published last week in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)[PDF], the authors describe how the blue whirl’s mesmerizing color makes it notable. “The yellow color [in conventional fire whirls] is due to radiating soot particles, which form when there is not enough oxygen to burn the fuel completely,” paper co-author Elaine Oran said in apress statement. “Blue in the whirl indicates there is enough oxygen for complete combustion, which means less or no soot, and is therefore a cleaner burn.” This cleaner burn could have significant applications outside the lab. The researchers initially wanted to see how regular fire whirls behave on water. Their suspicion was that fire whirls would be better at burning oil spilled on the ocean’s surface than traditional flames were. Their findings backed them up: Fire whirls burn hotter while sucking up fuel away from the surface. If they could find a way to produce a blue whirl on a larger scale, it would clean up spills more efficiently while leaving behind less airborne pollutants. What's even more promising is that blue whirls burn without the chaotic turbulence of yellow flame tornadoes—at least in the lab. You can watch the blue fire ignite in the video below.

Nor didYogi Bear, orThe Flintstones, or any of Hanna-Barbera’s multiple animated properties that Turner hadpurchasedthe rights to air as part of his children’s programming blocks on the Turner Broadcasting Station (TBS).Scoobywas not concerned with the environment—his friends got around in a smoke-belching van. As an environmental activist, Turner decided he wanted to use more of TBS’s airtime to explore the effects of pollution, deforestation, and the ozone layer. In 1988, TurnersummonedBarbara Pyle, his vice president of environmental concerns, and gave her two words: ""Captain Planet."" Pyle asked what that meant. ""Figure it out,"" he said, and turned away. The rise of eco-consciousness in the1980s had been reflected on an episode-by-episode basis on several television shows, but none had ever made it the recurring focus. WithCaptain Planet and the Planeteers, an animated series that ran from 1990 to 1996, Turner had ushered in thefirstprogramming of its kind: a narrative that hinged directly on the man-made hazards putting stress on the environment. Working with producers Thom Beers and Nicholas Boxer, Pyle took Turner’s notion and beefed it up considerably: Captain Planet would be a mullet-wearing hero who materializes when summoned by the Planeteers, a group of five teenagers from across the globe who try to minimize the damage done by eco-villains like Looten Plunder and Verminous Skumm. Instead of bank robberies, the team would confront tuna fishermen entrapping dolphins and oil drillers. Pollution wouldweakenCaptain Planet; solar energy would empower him. Pyle ran afull-page adinThe Hollywood Reporter, calling on the entertainment industry to lend its talents to television’s first environmentally-aware educational program for kids. Despite having no credits in voiceover work,Tom Cruisewas the first to get back to her; as an activist, Cruise appreciated the message and agreed to voice Captain Planet, who bore a passing resemblance to the actor. Whoopi Goldberg, Neil Patrick Harris, Jeff Goldblum, and several other well known actors followed suit. Pyle evengotCarl Sagan and Jean-Michel Cousteau (Jacques's son) to consult on the program for no fee. But whenCaptain Planet and the Planeteerspremiered in September of 1990—it aired both on TBS and in syndication—Cruise was nowhere to be heard. After recording six episodes, theDays of Thunderstar wasreportedly insistenton having more control in how the show was merchandised and what topics it would explore. (At the time, his representatives declared it was a scheduling issue.) Rather than have a jarring vocal change during the first season, producers opted to re-record his lines. Turner, meanwhile, had tried to convince his board of directors that the expensive series would be worthwhile. Fearing kids wouldn’t want anything to do with a ""message"" cartoon or that they might not even pick up on the message at all, they insisted Turner was wasting money. Very informal polls of kids saw things differently. In a piece inThe New York Times, 8-year-old critic Mollie Lief said she grasped the concept of an episode in which animal watering holes were drying up. ""The elephants, the birds, the fish, they have to have water,"" she said. ""It’s a good show to teach children."" Savvy consumer that she was, Lief also mentioned she had no desire for aCaptain PlanetT-shirt, declaring ""that's not my style."" That sentiment might have disappointed Turner, who was dependent on the 50-plus licensees making tie-in products to help fund the Captain Planet Foundation, a firm devoted to financing environmental education programs. Unlike most shows, toys forCaptain Planethad to meet a reasonable standard of sustainability. A globe bearing the Captain’s likeness was made from paperboard andstuffedwith recycled clothing; toy packaging used recycled cardboard. (There was never getting around the plastic used for the action figures, which some observers cheerfully pointed out was counter-productive to the show’s aversion to wastefulness.) By 1993,Captain Planetwas a success: more than 7 million weekly viewers tuned in to see how the Planeteers would resolve ivory poaching, puppy mills, and radiation leaks. Brief 30-second spots at the end would highlight tips that could be implemented in the home, like cutting up six-pack plastic rings before disposal. Other cartoons, likeTeenage Mutant NinjaTurtles, began to slip in eco-friendly messages: the Turtles reminded kids not to leave the water running while brushing. Unlike most animated shows of the era, which typically had short production runs of two or three years,Captain Planetran for six seasons and 113 episodes. In 1994, it evenchanged its nametoThe New Adventures of Captain Planetto remind viewers they weren’t watching reruns. It was a large library of lecturing, and not everyone was pleased. Some critics believed the series instilled a concerning suspicion of humans in children, where man and technology were inevitably responsible for harming nature. One pundit called it the ""greenwashing"" of youth. In the end,Captain Planetwas in little danger of creating an environmental cult.Accordingto Pyle, environmental consciousness ceased to be cool; Turner wound up selling TBS to Time-Warner, minimizing his input over content. The sixth and final season, which was aired internationally, was on ice for 10 years before being screened in the United States. It wouldn’t be the Captain’s last stand, however. Laura Turner Seydel, Ted’s daughter, held fundraisers to keep the Captain Planet Foundation going, and the organization isstill in operationtoday. The characters recently popped up in aFord Focuscommercial, and Hollywood is mulling apossiblefeature film. While a new wave of licensing might create new waste materials, the show really did try its best to practice what it preached: animatorsrecycledthe storyboards for each episode."
554,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84780/11-green-habits-arent-actually-green-all,,"Despite the surfeit of so-called “eco-friendly” options that exist today, it isn’t easy being green. Even products boasting “all natural” or “green” labels often carry hidden environmental costs you probably hadn’t considered. Looking to clean up your act? Here are 11 habits that aren’t as green as they may appear. A package that comes with a green “Organic” sticker isn’t necessarily the best choice. Certified organic farms are greener in some regards: They refrain from using synthetic pesticides and practice sustainable farming methods like crop rotation. But these aspects are small pieces of agriculture’s total environmental impact. Organically-raised beef still produces methane, which is a major contributor to global warming, and organic labels have nothing to do with how far the food traveled to get to your plate. Instead consider buying from local farms, which are sometimes too small to afford organic certification even when they qualify. When corn ethanol first started to gain popularity in the U.S., it was hailed as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuel. Today most scientists are in agreement that the environmental impact of ethanol production cancels out its benefits. Farming corn requires plowing into habitats and spraying fertilizer that could potentially contaminate water sources. On top of that, the process used to convert corn into fuel burns more energy than it’s worth. It’s true that hybrid cars do produce fewer emissions than their gas-guzzling counterparts on the road, but that doesn’t automatically make them easy on the environment. More energy is required to manufacture a hybrid than a conventional car, which results in greater amounts of air pollution. Gathering the materials for a hybrid’s car battery can also leave a negative impact. Most hybrid batteries are made from materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel—elements that are difficult to mine without leaving whole landscapes disrupted. If you commit to owning a hybrid vehicle, do what you can to get your money’s worth. Its lower emissions will begin to offset its environmental costs at around 160,000 miles. In the meantime, the only truly Earth-friendly way to get around? Your own two feet. It’s easy to feel good about yourself after hauling a bag of bottles to the recycling center, but perhaps those warm-and-fuzzy feelings aren’t as well deserved as we’d like to think. High recycling rates are a symptom of our mass consumption of disposable goods. It also takes a huge number of items to reap even small rewards. (According to one 2015 article, you’d have to recycle 40,000 plastic bottles to offset the environmental cost of one passenger’s flight from NYC to London. If they’re flying first- or business-class, that number jumps to 100,000.) What’s more, turning recyclable materials into new products also burns energy and adds to air pollution. And that’s assuming that they make it to the plant in the first place: Some facilities will toss out recyclables that are less easy to process. Carrying around one water bottle is certainly greener than buying the disposable ones by the case, but that doesn’t mean reusable water bottles don’t leave behind a damaging carbon footprint of their own. Even bottle companies that spin themselves as earth-friendly will often forgo using recycled materials for virgin aluminum. Processing a ton of aluminum creates 10 times the amount of carbon dioxide that’s produced by a ton of steel. In comparison, recycled aluminum requires just 5 percent of the energy of the virgin material. Don’t be fooled by deceptive packaging when perusing the aisles of your grocery store. If a product has a picture of a leaf, a globe, or an endangered animal on the label, that doesn’t make it any eco-friendlier than the product on the shelf next to it. The FDA has a very loose definition of what qualifies as “all-natural,” so food manufacturers will often slap the label on a box in order to convince consumers that what they’re eating is healthy and better for Planet Earth. Sometimes all it takes is some strategic use of the color green: According to one 2013 study, consumers were more likely to choose a candy bar with nutrition info printed on a green label than one whose nutrition info was printed on red or white—even though the two bars had the exact same calorie count. When used properly, there’s no question that compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) outshine the alternative. They use 75 percent less energy than traditional incandescents, but when disposed of incorrectly they can cause harm to the environment and your health. The mercury content of CFls makes them a hazard when tossed out with the regular trash. Instead, take your bulb to your local recycling center once it’s expired and let the experts handle it. Composting offers plenty of benefits: It keeps your scraps out of the landfill while nourishing your garden at the same time. But just because a compost pile is “natural” doesn’t mean it’s free of health risks. A pile of decomposing waste can quickly turn into a hotbed for dangerous pathogens like legionella (the culprit behind Legionnaires’ disease). They’re also known to breed tremorgenic mycotoxins, which can cause neurological problems like tremors and seizures in people, pets, and wildlife. Protect your pets by keeping your compost pile in an enclosed (but not airtight) container. To protect yourself, always avoid direct contact with skin when handling compost and make sure to wash up thoroughly afterwards. Home cleaners are great at getting rid of tough stains, but they can also be responsible for releasing harmful chemicals into the air you breathe. But the alternative, so-called “green” cleaners, aren’t required to meet any industry standards. The only way to know that the product you’re using is truly earth-friendly is to make it yourself. The good news: DIY-ing your own cleaners is actually a pretty simple process, and usually involves harnessing the power of household staples like vinegar, baking soda, rubbing alcohol, and citrus. The main benefit of cloth diapers over disposable ones is that they’re meant to be better for the environment and easier on your wallet. Research has shown that at least the first half of that equation isn’t necessarily the case. When the effects of washing cloth diapers were taken into account, they were found to have pretty much the same environmental impact as the disposable versions. What’s more, cotton production comes with numerous environmental costs (the fertilizers required to grow it are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions). So if you’re responsible for diapers that need to be changed, don’t feel guilty about going with the more convenient option. Solar panels have become synonymous with “green energy.” In theory, they’re a great way to provide your home with clean, renewable power, but the process that goes into producing them is a little more complicated. Manufacturing solar panels requires water, electricity, and chemicals, and produces waste products and greenhouse gases. While this is partially unavoidable, some solar companies go out of their way to leave less of an impact. Do your best to research manufacturers before making the decision to go solar.

555,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84716/todays-electric-cars-are-good-enough-most-driving-trips-study-finds,,"The average U.S. driver could buy an electric car and not worry a bit about changing their driving patterns to accommodate it. A new study published inNature Energyestimates the distance most Americans drive per day, finding that it’s well within the range of modern battery electric vehicles (BEVs), even the non-Tesla options,Ars Technicareports. The charge on an electric vehicle varies based on things like air conditioning or heat usage and whether you’re driving through a city or on the highway. In this paper, MIT researchers analyzed data on U.S. driver behavior from the National Household and Transportation Survey, using 120,000 GPS-tracked trips across nine cities. Then, they applied their models of driver behavior to the capabilities of theNissan Leaf, an electric car that retails for about $29,000. The researchers also incorporated data on weather temperatures and how much people in different cities tend to drive. Nissan claims that the Leaf has a travel range of up to 107 miles, but the researchers estimate that the 2013 Leaf probably gets more like 73 miles per charge, since batteries wear down over time, and most people run the AC or heater while they drive, sucking up more energy. Based on this figure, the Leaf (and other electric vehicles at its price point) could meet U.S. driving needs on around 87 percent of days when people are on the road, the study finds, figuring that everyone is charging their car once a day (typically at night). Realistically, even more trips could be covered with electric vehicles, since other car models boast even higher ranges—the 2017 Chevy Volt promises a200 mile range, and the next generation of the Nissan Leaf is expected tomatch that. Ford also hopes to release a long-range electric car sometime in thenear future. [h/tArs Technica] Know of something you think we should cover? Email us at tips@mentalfloss.com."
556,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/85808/giant-pandas-are-no-longer-considered-endangered,,"Good news for giant pandas (and the people who love them): the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) no longer considers them to be an endangered species,LiveScience reports. On Sunday, September 4, IUCN announced updates to itsRed List of Threatened Species, a comprehensive inventory that details the global conservation status of various animal, plants, and fungi species. According to the organization, the giant panda’s population numbers have increased enough for the group to downgrade the species as “vulnerable."" Wild giant pandas mostly live in China’s bamboo forests. Threats including poaching and human-caused habitat destruction—which drives animals from their homes and also causes food shortages—pushed the giant panda to the brink of extinction. But due to recent forest protection and reforestation measures, things are looking up: A nationwide census conducted in 2014 found that China’s wild population of adult giant pandas now numbers1864—a dramatic increase from 1596 in 2004. Add cubs to the mix, and the number rises to 2060. Thanks in part to the World Wildlife Fund’s iconic logo, few endangered species are more recognizable than the adorable giant panda. But the WWF shouldn’t consider changing its mascot just yet: Even though its population is rebounding, the IUCN says that the panda’s habitat and food sources are still threatened by climate change. More than 35 percent of its bamboo habitat could vanish over the next century, they warn. “Whereas the decision to downlist the giant panda to vulnerable is a positive sign confirming that the Chinese government’s efforts to conserve this species are effective, it is critically important that these protective measures are continued, and that emerging threats are addressed,” the IUCN’s report concluded. According toThe New York Times, the Tibetan antelope was also removed from the IUCN’s “endangered” list—but other animals didn’t fare so well. The eastern gorilla is now closer to extinction, and the plains zebra is “near threatened” due to hunting. [h/tLiveScience] Know of something you think we should cover?

557,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84914/new-database-tracks-160-years-walrus-hot-spots,,"As of last month, scientists studying walruses can map out just where the blubbery animals hang out in the coastal Pacific—and where they’ve hung out for the past 160 years,NPRreports. A newdatabaseyears in the making documents the locations of walrus “haulouts”—when the marine mammals venture onto the beach or ice to rest between feeding escapades, often in groups that number in thethousands. Why these hordes of walruses gather where they do is somewhat of a mystery. Haulouts aren't always on a beach that’s near their hunting grounds, and they willswitch locationsseemingly at random after years of flocking to the same spot annually. And because of climate change, the options for resting spots are becoming limited since the ice floes that have been haulout hot spots in the past are melting. Female and young walruses especially tend to gather on ice, since haulouts can be somewhat risky for them, should there be a stampede triggered by the appearance of a predator or another unpleasant surprise. Now, some of those ice floes are no longer available to them. Walruses on land have been fascinating naturalists, observers, and hunters for centuries. In 1874, naturalist Henry Wood Elliott described a gathering of 150 male walruses in Alaska as looking like “so many gnomes or demons of fair romance,” as NPR quotes. (He was clearly appalled by them: ""The longer I looked at them the more heightened was my disgust; for they resembled distorted, mortified, shapeless masses of flesh,"" hewrote.) The new database’s creators, including both U.S. and Russian scientists, referenced old ships’ logs dating back to the 1850s, oral histories from walrus-hunting Native peoples, and books and articles from Russia, Canada, and the U.S. The resulting database logs 150 known walrus haulouts, documenting how many walruses have been observed there, the ages and sexes that tend to congregate, what seasons it has been used during, and what decade walruses were last seen there. Hopefully, tracking walrus haulout patterns will help scientists discover how they choose their resting spots, and how those spots are evolving due to climate change.

558,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/85475/three-day-weekends-are-good-environment,,"Working fewer hours may be good for both our mental health and the health of the planet. Sociologist Alex Williams reports inThe Conversationthat reducing the average work week from five days to four could reduce American energy use by a whopping 20 percent. It could also improve our mental state. Williams is the author ofInventing the Future, which explores how new technology could change how we work. In his recent article, he pulls together several studies to argue that three-day weekends could drastically reduce energy consumption and create an economy that is more environmentally friendly. Citing a 2006 study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research [PDF], Williams explains that instituting a three-day weekend would reduce the amount of time Americans spend commuting to work in gas-guzzling, fume-spewing cars, as well as the amount of energy used by offices to keep lights, computers, and air conditioning running all day. He also notes that a 2015 study in Sweden found that, for workers, fewer hours not only reduced illness, but increased productivity. Overall, he claims that after reviewing numerous studies of both the environmental and the psychological impact of fewer work hours, there is substantial evidence that reducing the number of days in the work week would improve environmental and mental wellbeing without damaging productivity. He argues, “Directing gains in economic efficiency towards increased free time and reduced energy consumption, rather than making more stuff, could create a better and more environmentally safe world.” [h/tThe Conversation]"

Today, New York Harbor’s oyster population is a shadow of its former self, but one group is teaming up with local restaurants to change that. AsObserverreports, theBillion Oyster Project(BOP) aims to replenish the area with at least one billion live oysters by 2030. Since it was formed in 2014, the group has added 17 million of the shellfish to the bottom of the harbor. To obtain the oyster shells used to grow new ones, BOP doesn’t have to look far. Up to half a million oysters are served in New York City eateries each week, and once they’ve been shucked and slurped clean, the shells don’t hold much value to restaurant owners. So far over 50 restaurants have signed up to donate their weekly oyster shell waste to the project. After it’s cured and prepared properly, one recycled shell can be used to grow as many as 20 new oysters. Restoring the harbor’s oyster population to where it once was is just part of the equation. Oysters act as natural filters, with one oyster capable of cleaning up to 50 gallons of water a day. Oysters can help rid the harbor of organic waste, transforming it into a more hospitable environment for even more life. In an effort to reach their goal of one billion oysters in the next 14 years, BOP is adding several new reef sites this summer. [h/tObserver] Know of something you think we should cover?

561,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/81553/how-living-inside-biosphere-2-changed-these-scientists-lives,,"Taber MacCallum and Jane Poynter witnessed the most affecting solar eclipse of their lives in 1992. That's because as they watched the Sun disappear behind the Moon’s shadow, they were also watching their oxygen supplies slipping away. At the time, they and their six teammates were sealed inside Biosphere 2, a 91-foot-tall, 3.14-acre experimental complex outside Tucson, Arizona. “We were all just glued to the monitors,” MacCallum recalls, “because you can see when the Sun was hidden away by the Moon, for that half hour period, the CO2 started going up. The oxygen started going down. You could see the actual, palpable effect.” Without the Sun, the plants around them had stopped photosynthesizing and producing oxygen. Earth’s atmosphere is so huge that half an hour of this during a solar eclipse doesn’t have a noticeable effect. But inside an atmosphere 19 trillion times smaller than Earth’s, MacCallum and Poynter noticed. “It's very hard on the Earth to get that tight a visceral connection between your behavior and the environment,” MacCallum says. Today, the imposing white dome of Biosphere 2 still rises above the Arizona desert like a cross between a greenhouse and the Taj Mahal. Now, it’s a research station maintained by the University of Arizona where researchers study Earth processes, global environmental change, weathering, landscape evolution, and the effect of drought on rainforests, among many projects. Because of its systems and size, scientists can do controlled experimentation at an unprecedented scale in Biosphere 2. Another view of Biosphere 2. Image credit: © CDO courtesy of the University of Arizona MacCallum and Poynter returned to Biosphere 2 in May 2016 for the One Young World Environmental Summit to speak to young environmental leaders from around the world. But in the early 1990s, they and six others were sealed inside it for two years and 20 minutes, from September 26, 1991 to September 26, 1993, in a life-changing experiment that was equal parts humility and hubris—both shortsighted and ahead of its time. “The big questions of the two-year mission,” says MacCallum, were, “Can we build artificial biospheres? Can these be objects of science? Can we learn from them?” We could and did. As a result of their voluntary containment, we learned how to seal a giant building so that it loses less air than the International Space Station, manage damaged coral reefs, feed eight people on a half-acre of land, and recycle water and human waste in a closed system, among other things. The structure itself, built from 1987 to 1991, is a technological marvel even today. The idea was to build a miniaturized biosphere completely separated from Earth, see if humans could live inside it, and see how they affected the animals and plants around them and vice versa. (Why call it Biosphere 2? Because Earth is Biosphere 1.) It’s roughly as tightly sealed as the space station and separated from the soil around it by a 500-ton steel liner. In the early '90s, when the mission started, the ideas that humans were causing climate change or even that Earth was a biosphere at all were much less accepted than they are today. “When we started this project, I was spelling the word ‘biosphere’ down the phone,” says MacCallum. Much the way a botanical garden's conservatory is, Biosphere 2’s glass-walled domes and pyramids were filled with different biomes: rainforest, ocean (with a coral reef), savannah, desert, mangrove swamp, and agricultural fields in which the team grew all their crops. They ate so many sweet potatoes that Poynter turned orange, but their world also included domestic animals: goats (their only dairy source), chickens, pigs, and tilapia. They had only enough coffee plants to make one cup of coffee per person every few weeks. The desert biome in Biosphere 2. Image credit: © CDO courtesy of the University of Arizona Problems quickly developed. The coral reef became overgrown with algae. Most of the pollinating insects died. A bush baby in the rainforest biome got into the wiring and was electrocuted. Each of the crew members had a primary job: Poynter was in charge of the farm and farm equipment, and MacCallum was in charge of the analytical chemistry lab inside Biosphere 2. The crew had to do all their research, farming, and experiments while hungry because they weren’t getting enough calories. More dangerous was the decline in oxygen. That night in 1992, their oxygen levels dipped temporarily, but overall their oxygen levels declined from 20.9 percent to 14.5 percent. (Any environment below 19.5 percent oxygen is defined as oxygen-deficient by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA.) The low oxygen made them lethargic. For months they couldn’t sleep properly because it gave them sleep apnea. Scientists were monitoring them and communicating with them from the outside, and finally in August 1993, just a month before the crew left Biosphere 2, they decided to start pumping in oxygen. Taber MacCallum tests air conditions in Biosphere 2. Image credit: © CDO courtesy of the University of Arizona Later, scientists figured out that the culprits were microbes proliferating in the Biosphere’s compost-rich soil, combined with the building’s concrete. The microbes themselves were not harmful, but they converted oxygen into carbon dioxide, which then reacted with the building’s concrete to form calcium carbonate and irreversibly remove oxygen molecules from the Biosphere's atmosphere. Still, looking back more than two decades years later, MacCallum and Poynter view the experiment as a success. Its initial science findings have been developed on in the years since—the University of Arizona has owned the facility since 2007—and its research focus remains as big picture as it ever was: global environmental change. Beyond the science, even just seeing Biosphere 2 could change people’s perspectives. Poynter recalls getting an email while she was inside Biosphere 2 from a man who walked around the perimeter of the structure as part of the monitoring effort, who said, “'I get it now, because I walked around Biosphere 2, this miniature version of planet Earth, and it smacked me in the face: you guys only have what you have in there, and you have nothing else.'” “That is fundamentally the message: that it's finite,” Poynter says. “And also very resilient.” When after two years they finally emerged, Poynter had lost virtually all the enzymes to digest meat from eating so little of it. Nevertheless, she says, “Physically, we were in pretty decent shape. I had spent every day farming, so I was pretty strong.” Jane Poynter checks on the goats in Biosphere 2. Image credit: © CDO courtesy of the University of Arizona Still, it was a huge change. “The experience of coming out of Biosphere 2 was amazing in that it was like being reborn into this world and seeing it with fresh eyes,” she recalls. That night they had a big party with friends they hadn’t seen in two years. “And then the next morning there was this giant pile of garbage. It was this stark reminder of this consumable world that we live in.” Poynter and MacCallum, who were dating when they entered Biosphere 2, married nine months after leaving it. Together with three others, they formed Paragon Space Development Corporation. Over the years, they developed a range of aerospace technology, including temperature control and life support systems for NASA and SpaceX that could be used to support people on the Moon or on Mars. Their current company,World View Enterprises, spun out of Paragon in 2013. Key staff include chief scientist Alan Stern, head of theNew Horizons mission to Pluto, andastronaut Mark Kelly(twin brother of astronautScott Kelly), who is the director of flight crew operations. World View sends uncrewed vehicles high up in the near-space stratosphere to research weather and other phenomena, and aims to one day bring people up to where the sky is black, the Earth looks curved, and it’s visibly clear that Earth is the home we share. The curvature of the Earth as captured by a World View craft. Image credit: World View It's that big-picture view that Poynter and MacCallum want to share with others. After talking with astronauts, they think that the “overview effect” astronauts feel when seeing the Earth from space is not unlike what they felt in Biosphere 2. Like Poynter and MacCallum, astronauts describe feeling deeply moved by the experience to do something to help Earth and its people. Poynter says the company’s technology is proprietary and has to do with buoyancy control. “The basis of it is our ability to do very accurate altitude control,” she says, which allows their vehicles to take advantage of prevailing winds at different altitudes to travel exactly where they want. World View Enterprises is particularly interested in taking leaders and influencers up to the stratosphere. Because you can’t just lock world leaders inside a biosphere in the desert for two years to give them the insight that Poynter and MacCallum know so deeply: We, as humans, are fully connected to and dependent on our environment. “In the biosphere,"" Poynter says, ""I really fell in love with the Earth."""

Here are a few more intriguing facts about ice, both on our planet and beyond. Later we’ll talk about ice on other planets. But if we want to talk about ice on Earth, that’s thecryosphere—the NOAA breaks it down as the “frozen water part of the Earth system.” Cryo comes from the Greek for cold, “kryos.” It includes not only all types of frozen water, but permafrost, which is soil that has existed below freezing for extended periods of time, but doesn’t necessarily have any water. Ice and liquid water may be made of the same stuff, but those molecules arrange themselves in different ways depending on whether they’re in a liquid or solid state. In liquid water, molecules are able to fill in gaps and pack themselves in more closely than in the spread out and ordered crystalline structure of ice, which makes ice less dense and therefore able to float on water. At least that’s what usually happens. Heavy water ice (where the hydrogen atoms have a proton and a neutron, as opposed to just the proton in normal hydrogen) does sink. That may happen because the water molecules themselves become heavier thanks to the heavier hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogens form stronger bonds. Sea ice alone comes in myriad varieties, andArcticandAntarcticsea ice have their own distinct vocabularies. Brash, frazil, nilas, and pancake ice are a few of the varieties found in both. If you’re ever navigating near the poles, you’d better be able to distinguish an iceberg from an icefoot, a bummock from a hummock, and a floe from a floeberg. But if you think that’s a lot to remember, the Inupiaq of Alaska have100 names for ice—which makes sense for a people whose survival requires expert knowledge of the characteristics and behavior of frozen water in all its variations. Of course, linguistically, it’s not quite that simple; their language is polysynthetic, meaning that words are formed by combining roots and endings to form countless words. Moreover, some words do double duty; amapsa, for instance,is both an overhanging ledge of snow and a human spleen, which “overhangs” other organs, as far as Inupiaq see it. Nevertheless, that’s a lot of nuance for a substance we usually refer to with a single term. Ice storms can be deadly. Here’s how they happen: Snow enters a warm layer of the atmosphere and melts into drops of rain, then passes through a cold layer of air. The rain drops don’t have time to refreeze as they fall through this thin cold layer. But when they finally hit a cold surface, they immediately turn to ice. The result is an especially thick, heavy coating of ice that turns sidewalks and roads into skating rinks, making driving and walking very dangerous. As ice thickens on power lines and trees, its weight can snap cables and damage branches, leading to widespread power outages and turning tree limbs into deadly falling objects. Now scientists are modeling how and where these storms are likely to strike in the future bysimulating ice stormsin New Hampshire research forest plots. It’sfrozen carbon dioxide, which can change from a solid to a gas at room temperature and pressure without going through a liquid state. Dry ice is quite useful in keeping things cold because it freezes at a chilling minus 109.3 degrees Fahrenheit. And of course, it’s also a great way to set the scene for spooky theatrical productions and haunted houses. The use of ice for food preservation has been aroundfor millennia. In the United States, people depended on a variety of methods to prevent food from spoiling, including canning, salting and drying. But the most effective method was to keep food cool with blocks of ice. In the early 1800s,ice harvesting as an industrytook hold as horse-drawn ice cutters pulled thick blocks of ice from frozen lakes for use in insulated ice houses and cellars. By the late 19th century, household iceboxes, forerunners to the electric refrigerator, were common. Ice didn’t only provide convenience for individual homes. It was key to advancingmass production and distribution of meatand other perishables, which in turn supported urbanization and a variety of other industries. By the end of the century, however, pollution and sewage dumping had contaminated many natural ice supplies. This problem helped spur innovations that led to the modern electric refrigerator. While there were earlier versions in the 19th and early 20th centuries, GE’s Monitor-Top fridge, released in 1927, was the first to see widespread commercial success. It’s the second largest ice mass on Earth after the Antarctic ice sheet, and it contains enough water to raise ocean levels by at least 20 feet. (If you’re wondering, global sea levels would rise by more than 260 feet if every glacier and ice sheet on Earth melted.) The Greenland ice sheet’s melt rate is accelerating at a sobering rate: According to astudypublished earlier this year in the journalNature Climate Change, the ice sheet now loses a mind-boggling 8000 tons persecond. Scientists arestudyingGreenland’s ice sheet to document its past behavior in the hopes of better understanding how it may respond to climate change. White light is made up of a rainbow of colors and each has a different wavelength. As snow accumulates atop an iceberg, the air bubbles in the snow get compressed and more light penetrates the ice rather than getting reflected by bubbles and tiny ice crystals. And here’s where the magic happens: Longer color wavelengths, like red and yellow, get absorbed by the ice, while shorter wavelengths of color, like blue and green, reflect the light. That’s why icebergs and glaciers often appear blueish green. We tend to think of The Ice Age, as if there was just one. Actually, many others occurred before humans arrived on the scene, and they were often much more severe. At certain points the entire planet was likely frozen, something scientists call “Snowball Earth.” Some theorize that some ice ages were caused by the evolution of new life forms — plants as well as both unicellular and multi-celled organisms — which changed atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in ways that altered the greenhouse effect.New Scientisthas a nicerecapof the history of ice on Earth. Earth will continue to cycle through periods of ice and warming. But the current predicted rate of warming for the next century is at least20 times fasterthan past periods of warming, raising questions about how human-induced climate change will affect those natural cycles over the long term. Melting glaciers aren’t just a problem for glaciers. The loss of all that ice will affect the global water cycle and have a bigimpacton water supply and quality, energy generation and incidences of extreme weather. In some places, like the Andean region of South America and the Himalayas, those problemsare already starting to be felt. Hydrogen and oxygen, the building blocks of water, are plentiful in our solar system. But depending on their proximity to the Sun, different planets in the solar system havedifferent amounts of water. Those furthest from the Sun, like Jupiter and Saturn, have much more water than those closer to the Sun, like Earth, Mercury and Mars, where high temperatures made it harder for hydrogen and oxygen to form water molecules. Those planets of the outer solar system have several icymoons. One of the most intriguing is Europa, which is covered by a layer of ice several kilometers thick. Its icy surface contains intricate patterns of cracks and ridges, likely caused by tides of its subsurface ocean. Europa’s abundant water has led scientists to speculate whether it might be capable of supporting life. Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons, has another curious feature. Its southern polar region contains “cryovolcanoes” —an exotic type of geyser thats spews ice instead ofmagma. It happens when ice deep below the surface gets heated and turned into a vapor that then erupts into the moon’s chilly atmosphere as ice particles. Satellites tell us that Mars stores its ice (both dry ice and frozen water) in polar ice caps, permafrost and on a handful of glaciers. And the Red Planet’s reserves of ice may hold clues to the long-debated question of whether it is capable of supporting life. Until recently, it was thought that the current extremely low temperatures and thin atmosphere of the planet prevented water from existing in its liquid state. But in 2015, NASA scientists reported compelling evidence that briny wateris still present on Mars, at least occasionally. Where that water comes from remains a mystery, but one theory focuses on melting subsurface ice as the source. Could that limited amount of watersustain lifeunder current planetary conditions? That’s something future missions to Mars will continue exploring. Glaciers are a vast resource of information about conditions on Earth over hundreds of thousands of years. Climatologists drill cylinder-shaped samples of ice from glaciers and analyze the dust, minerals, ash, gas bubbles and human-made pollutants that have collected in snow for millennia. From this data, they can determine details about things as varied as forest fires, volcanic activity, sea ice extent, solar variability andatmospheric circulation, as well as anticipate future climatic conditions. The National Ice Core Laboratory alone hasmore than 70,000 ice samplesto piece together a picture of the Earth over long periods of time. Want to explore for yourself? The World Data Center for Paleoclimatology maintains incrediblearchivesof ice core data. From the Andes to the Alps, frozen human remains allow us fascinating glimpses of how people lived hundreds and thousands of years ago. One of the most exquisitely well-preserved is the Incan teenager known asLa Doncella, or the Maiden, who was left along with two younger children as religious offerings near the frigid summit of an Argentinian volcano more than 500 years ago. Another, much older specimen isÖtzi the Iceman, discovered in the Alps near the Austria-Italy border in 1991. For being a 5300-year-old corpse, Ötzi lookspretty darned good."

564,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84909/time-lapse-video-reveals-process-coral-bleaching,,"A time-lapse video filmed by scientists at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia reportedly provides viewers with a first-ever look atcoral bleachingin progress,The Telegraphreports. Their observations, which they recently published in the journalCoral Reefs, explore the underlying mechanisms behind the harmful phenomenon. Coral gets its brilliant colors from special, symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which live inside its tissues and consume its metabolic waste. In turn, the algae produce sugars and amino acids, which the coral polyp eats. But when corals become stressed from changing water temperatures, pollution, changes in salinity, and other external factors, they undergo a destructive process called coral bleaching. The algae leach out of the coral, and the coral turns a stark white as its calcium-carbonate skeleton is exposed. The coral is still alive at this point, but it’s now only receiving 20 percent of its needed food intake. If bleaching continues, the organism will eventually die. Since coral reefsshelter 25 percent of marine species, the consequences of bleaching are dire. Scientists already knew that factors like climate change and El Niño, which heat up oceans, are major culprits. (Conversely, too-cold water can also cause coral bleaching.) However, they had never watched the process unfold. To simulate the effects of coral bleaching, QUT scientists took a 2.6-gallon aquarium filled withHeliofungia actiniformiscoral specimens. Over the course of 12 hours, they gradually increased the heat from around 79°F to nearly 90°F. The researchers kept the heat up for eight days, filming continuously as the coral gradually expelled the algae cells. The footage gave the researchers an invaluable look at what happens when coral reefs bleach. First, the corals swelled—sometimes up to nearly 340 percent of their normal size—during a process called pulsed inflation. Then, they started to violently shudder as they spewed out their color-giving zooxanthellae. With each spasm, they grew whiter and whiter. “What’s really interesting is just how quickly and violently the coral forcefully evicted its resident symbionts [algae],” QUT researcher Brett Lewissaid in a press release.  “TheH. actiniformisbegan ejecting the symbionts within the first two hours of us raising the water temperature of the system.” According to the scientists, coral bleaching isn’t all bad—at least in the short-term scheme of things,National Geographicpoints out. Past studies have shown thatH. actiniformisis relatively resilient to coral bleaching. This might be because the coral expels the zooxanthellae so quickly: When waters heat up, the algae becomes toxic, and the coral increases its chance of survival by getting rid of it. But if the water temperature doesn’t lower quickly enough for new algae to re-inhabit the coral’s tissues, it will likely die. Coral bleaching is a global problem. Surveys of the Great Barrier Reef indicate that more than90 percentof it is damaged by bleaching, and as temperatures continue to soar worldwide, reefs in the Caribbean, Atlantic, and Pacific are expected to suffer as well. There are a fewbright spotswhere corals are doing well, despite the environmental pressures. Scientists are studying them to find out why. [h/tThe Telegraph]"
565,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/83784/4-reasons-why-climbing-everest-deadlier-ever,,"On April 18, 2014, an avalanchekilled16 Sherpas on Mount Everest, making it the deadliest day in the mountain’s history. But one year later, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake triggered another fatal avalanche that killed more than 20 climbers and shut the mountain down for the 2015 season. During this year's season, at least 11 climbers have died on Everestexperts say. At 29,029 feet, Everest is known for its dangers; that's part of the allure. But in recent years, tragedies have spiked, and frozen bodies scattered across the mountain are an eerie reminder of the growing hazards. So why is the world’s tallest mountain claiming more lives than ever before? Everest tragedies are nothing new; since 1990, at least one climber has died in pursuit of the summit every year. But each climbing season, Everest is getting more unstable.Kent Clement, a professor of outdoor studies atColorado Mountain College, argues that climate change is possibly the most imminent risk for climbers. “As temperatures rise, Everest’s thousands of feet of ice and water are becoming unstable, making the mountain even more volatile,” Clement said. Collapsing seracs—50- to 100-foot columns of ice formed by intersecting glacier crevasses—are a growing threat. Seracs can stand perfectly still for decades, then spontaneously fall over, killing those nearby and, in some cases, triggering avalanches further down the mountain. Case in point: The deadly 2014 avalanche that killed 16 Sherpas was caused by a serac collapse in the Khumbu Icefall, themost dangeroussection of the route up Everest's southeastern face. As you’d expect, climate-related risks are the new norm. A study in the journalThe Cryosphere[PDF] predicts that Mount Everest’s glaciers could shrink by 70 percent this century, making currently unstable sections of the routes even more so. In addition to natural disasters, Everest climbers face a number of life-threatening health risks. In high-altitude settings, there is less oxygen in the atmosphere, and oxygen doesn’t diffuse into a climber’s blood as well as it would at sea level. That can lead to serious medical problems. The two most common illnesses on Everest are high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), in which constricted blood vessels cause fluid to leak into the lungs' air sacs; and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), in which fluid leaks from blood vessels in the brain, causing headaches, neurologic dysfunction, coma, and eventually death if not treated (and in some cases, even when treated). “Altitude illness impacts people in different ways, and we don’t really know who is susceptible until they have altitude illness,”Christopher Van Tilburg, an expert in travel medicine and a physician Oregon's Providence Hood River Memorial Hospital, told Mental Floss. “High-altitude pulmonary edemas can hit people suddenly—even highly trained, fit mountaineers.” Another health risk that affects a climber’s cognition is hypoxia, which is simply when the brain doesn’t get enough oxygen. According to Clement, hypoxia can drastically impair judgment, making it one of the most dangerous Everest risks. “The higher you climb, the more your judgment gets impaired,” Clement said. “It’s amazing how hard it is for smart people to do simple math and memory problems at high altitudes.” In addition to causing treacherous missteps, hypoxia can drive climbers to push harder and go farther than they normally would—but not in a good way. These “cognitive traps” often happen when a climber gets closer to the top and replace logic and safety with stubborn determination, putting everything at risk to reach their goal. Another word for it? Summit fever. According to Clement, the cure is setting a strict turnaround time: an ironclad moment when a climber promises to turn around and forego the summit to save their life. Turnaround times are decided before setting foot on Everest, and should be agreed upon between climbers, guides, and expedition leaders. But hypoxia, exposure, and inexperience can encourage climbers to ignore the protocol. “Every time you ignore your turnaround time, you’re putting yourself at risk,” Clement said. “Professional guides are also supposed to follow these rules, but they get stuck in cognitive traps, too, because the more clients they get to the top, the more clients they’ll have next season.” Any climb above 19,000 feet—the altitude known as “the death zone”—will have associated health risks, but there are treatments that can help climbers survive. Medicines include acetazolamide (sold under the brand nameDiamox), a diuretic that helps prevent a mild edema, and dexamethasone (brand nameDecadron), a steroid used to treat a brain edema and reverse the symptoms of acute mountain sickness. The only true fix for acute mountain sickness is immediate descent. The best way to stay alive on Everest is proper training, fitness, and organization, but even those steps can't guarantee safety. “Training doesn’t really offset objective hazards like rock falls, ice falls, avalanches, and earthquakes,” said Van Tilburg. “And while we have medicine for altitude illness to help people acclimatize, we don’t have medicines for the myriad other risks on Everest.”"

Long commutes have been linked tolower happinessand higher risk ofheart attack. And, according to new research from the University of Surrey in the UK, the air pollution from heavy traffic isn’t just outside your car. Sitting in traffic can up your exposure to polluted air by 40 percent compared to when the roads are clear, according to a study published in the journalEnvironmental Science: Processes and Impacts. Closed windows don’t entirely keep out air pollution, the study’s authors found, as the fan still sucks in dirty air and circulates it around the car. When cars are idling, accelerating, and decelerating in the same area, including in traffic and at red lights, all those extra emissions accumulate and are slower to disperse than when traffic is light. This study builds on previous research by the same group showing that crowded traffic signals expose people to29 times moreharmful particles than when cars were moving freely. Unfortunately, the study's authors don't yet have all the answers on how to solve the problem. Their current recommendations, made in apress release, aren't realistic for those traveling when it’s cold or hot or stuffy: ""one of the best ways to limit your exposure by keeping windows shut, fans turned off and to try and increase the distance between you and the car in front while in traffic jams or stationary at traffic lights,"" senior author Preshant Kumar explains. ""If the fan or heater needs to be on, the best setting would be to have the air re-circulating within the car without drawing in air from outdoors.” When car windows were closed and the fan shut off, there was a 76 percent reduction in the number of pollutants in the air inside.

567,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84696/global-warming-could-make-our-beaches-saltier,,"It seems like every week now, we’re learning about somenewandunexpectedconsequence of environmental upheaval. The latest comes from a beach in Delaware, where researchers say global warming has made the shore saltier. They published their findings in the journalScientific Reports. Peaceful as the beach may seem to us, it’s actually a well-oiled natural machine with a lot of moving parts. Elements like water quality, climate, erosion, pollution, and wildlife are all connected. As in any ecosystem, changes in one piece affect the others. Scientists from the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Center for Natural Resources Development (CNRDP) wanted to check in on the salinity of our beaches. They focused their attention on the littoral, or intertidal zone—the stretch of sand between high and low tide points. This part of the beach is prime territory not only for small children with toy shovels and buckets, but also for crabs, mussels, anemones, shorebirds, and seaweed. Co-author and coastal geologist Nancy Jackson traveled to Slaughter Beach in Delaware, where she collected almost 400 sand samples over the course of a month, capturing physical snapshots of the littoral zone at every point in the tidal cycle. Jackson and her colleagues Xiaolong Geng and Michel Boufadel then measured the chemical composition of the seawater and the water trapped between the grains of sand, also known as the pore water. They found that seawater near the beach had salt concentrations of 25 grams per liter (g/L). They expected to find similar or lower concentrations in the pore water, since the sand this high up the beach is also washed with groundwater from inland. Instead, they found that pore water in the top of the intertidal zone was much, much saltier, with concentrations of 60 to 100 grams of salt per liter of water. The researchers say these high numbers have likely been caused by a rise in evaporation. As beach temperatures rise, evaporation intensifies, leaving behind more salt in less water—a change that could have big consequences for the plants and animals that live there. ""Evaporation is an important driver of underground water flow and salinity gradients, and animals such as mussels and crabs are affected by changes in salinity,"" Geng said in apress statement. ""If the concentrations are too high or too low, they will move away."" Know of something you think we should cover? Email us attips@mentalfloss.com."

This loss of biodiversity may seem abstract, and there are plenty of plants and animals we’ve lost that you might never have encountered in your life. Others you could have bragged about seeing on vacation. As reported byPopular Science,a poster series created byExpedia UKhighlights some of the world’s tragic extinctions by advertising the unique animals associated with certain travel destinations. Thedodo, the poster child for human-driven extinction (despiteits smarts), would have been reason enough to visit the island of Mauritius, if the species hadn’t been eradicated by the 17th century. Take a look at these beautiful, vintage-inspired poster designs below. Once found in great numbers in the North Pacific, the Stellar's sea cow was hunted to extinction by 1768, less than 30 years after its discovery by Europeans. The sea cows could grow up to 30 feet long. The last recorded sighting of the giant galliwasp was in 1840. Its demise has been blamed on introduced predatorslike mongooses. The golden toad was last sighted in 1989, and its disappearance may be linked to climate change, though the data isn'tprecise enoughto make a clear judgment. The flightless moa was once New Zealand's dominant species of herbivore. It wasfirst describedin scientific literature in 1839, and was extinct by 1907. The thylacine, a marsupial known as theTasmanian tiger, wasintentionally exterminatedto protect Australian sheep in the 19th and 20th centuries. The last thylacine known to science died in a Tasmanian zoo in 1936. This sole remaining thylacine was famously caught on film in 1933, by a cameraman who gotbit on the buttby the creature’s impressive gaping jaws for his efforts.

Proterra’s latest electric bus design can travel 350 miles on a single charge, asWIREDreports. The new Catalyst E3 model gets far better mileage than the electric cars currently on the market, at least according to the company’s tests. The Nissan Leaf, for instance, only gets about 100 miles per charge at best, which might be fine for theaverage driver, but isn’t great for a city bus that is expected to run back and forth along its route all day. BYD, the Chinese company leading the way in electric buses, only gets a reported161 milesper charge on its 40-foot models.

But these days, the Earth’s wilderness is rapidly eroding.The Vergereports that, according to a recentstudypublished inCurrent Biology, 10 percent of the Earth’s wilderness has disappeared in the last two decades alone. Researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society analyzed satellite and survey data since the 1990s in order to measure the loss of the Earth’s untamed places. They defined wilderness as “biologically and ecologically largely intact landscapes that are mostly free of human disturbance.” By their definition, wilderness landscapes cease to be wilderness not when humans settle there—the researchers note that many indigenous peoples help preserve rather than erode wilderness—but when humans disturbed ecosystems with land conversion, industrial activity, or large-scale infrastructure projects. They found that, globally, 1.2 million square miles of wilderness have disappeared over the last 20 years, with the greatest loss occurring in South America (about a 30 percent loss) and Africa (14 percent loss). Today, only 23 percent of the Earth’s terrestrial area is wilderness. That’s bad news for a few reasons: The erosion of wilderness could have a negative impact on wildlife, indigenous communities, and climate change. Additionally, destroying even a small chunk of an ecosystem can have a negative impact on the rest, since wilderness areas are interconnected and interdependent.

Rather, we are flushing meds through our bodies into the sewers. In a new study inScience of the Total Environment, scientists collected wastewater from the University of Vermont over 10 days while students were moving out at the end of the school year. The result didn’t show a massive spike in drug concentrations in the water, indicating that when students moved out, they weren’t dumping all their pills into the toilet. The study did find that a large student population has a tangible effect on the local wastewater, though. As students left, the amount of caffeine and nicotine in the water decreased, but not significantly, while certain other meds showed an increase. As it turned out, student pee was actually diluting the wastewater of the older, permanent population in the area. After the students (and their pee supply) left, the water had higher concentrations of antidepressants, diabetes drugs, and ulcer medications. This research is about more than just student smoking habits. Birth control hormones in the water supply have been found to negatively affect wildlife, creating intersexfishandfrogs. Treatment plants don’t remove all of these chemicals, and some end up back in ourwater supplyin addition to polluting natural bodies of water. Despite the wastewater issue, the FDA actually recommends some medications be disposed by flushing to prevent them from being taken by children, pets, or anyone else—mainly powerful painkillers like oxycontin and percocet. Less dangerous meds can simply be trashed. While both can be turned over atDEA drug take-back events, the government is well aware that many people won’t wait around until their next safe disposal event. Since the pharmaceuticals in our water supply and sewage don’t have much to do with human behavior that could be changed—unless you want everyone to go off their birth control or just stop peeing for the sake of the fish—the growing body of research on the topic shows an immediate need for better wastewater treatment.

573,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/85036/july-2016-was-hottest-month-ever-recorded,,"New reports out fromNOAAandNASAshow that we’ve yet again lived through a record-breaking month of warmth—global temperature readings revealed that July 2016 was “absolutely the hottest month”ever recorded, according to NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt. This past July was 0.87°C (1.57°F) hotter than the 20thcentury average in NOAA’s monthly climate report, and the month finished up 0.84°C (1.55°F) above average in NASA’s findings. Global temperature anomalies in July 2016. Image credit:NOAA Data collected by thousands of observation stations on land and at sea discovered that temperatures were either the warmest ever recorded or much warmer than average across wide swaths of the planet. Areas that saw all-time record heat included a small part of the southeastern United States, as well as portions of southern Asia and the Pacific Ocean. Not only was last month the warmest July on record, but this record temperature anomaly made it the warmest month ever recorded. July typically sees the year’s highest average global temperature because it’s the peak of summer heating in the Northern Hemisphere, which has68 percent of the world's land, making it more prone to extreme heat than the Southern Hemisphere as a whole. This year’s warming trend was likely given a measurable assist byEl Niño, the abnormal warming of the equatorial waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean. The warm water of an El Niño can raise air temperatures and alter weather patterns in a way that creates abnormally warm weather elsewhere in the world. If it seems like you’ve seen this news before, there’s good reason for it—NOAA found that this July was the 15th month in a row with record-breaking global temperature anomalies. Every month since May 2015 has broken its respective all-time warmest record. The unbroken streak of anomalies made 2015 the world’s warmest year since instrumental records began in 1880. Unfortunately, 2014 broke the record for the hottest year too, and it looks like 2016 is on pace to break 2015's record. Yearly global temperature anomalies between 1880 and 2015. Image credit:NOAA So far, the global temperature anomaly in 2016 through July is +1.03°C (1.8°F), which is the first time we’ve ever recorded temperature a full one degree above normal. NOAA’s records show that the average global temperature has been at least a little above normal every month except one for the past 455 months, or since September 1978. The lone below-average month during that 38-year period was December 1984, when the global average temperature was 0.09°C (0.16°F) below normal. A few tenths of a degree Celsius above normal doesn’t seem like a very big deal, but just like the small temperature fluctuations brought about by an El Niño or La Niña, these seemingly tiny temperature anomalies can have a significant impact on both short-term weather and long-term climate trends. If the long-term trend of rising temperatures continues,some of the likely effectswill include more frequent droughts, more intense heat waves, more intense bouts of heavy rain, and rising sea levels."
574,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79188/how-one-earthquake-erased-empire-and-changed-course-human-history,,"At its height, the Portuguese empire spanned four continents, with territory everywhere from Rio de Janeiro to Macau. The first global empire, Portugal's mastery of the seas began in earnest in the 1400s, when the relatively small and isolated country sought to find new trade routes with Europe and the rest of the world. Its first major success came in 1488, when Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias rounded the southern tip of Africa. Ten years later, Vasco da Gama reached India. The ensuing centuries would witness Portuguese navigators establishing relations and trade with countries as far as Japan. By the middle of the 18th century, Portugal's capital of Lisbon was the fifth-most populous city in Europe, its port the third-busiest. It was one of, if not the, wealthiest cities in the world. It might still be, as Mark Molesky reveals inThis Gulf of Fire: The Destruction of Lisbon, or Apocalypse in the Age of Science and Reason, if not for an unspeakable catastrophe in 1755 that would leave the city leveled, the empire crippled, and the course of Western civilization forever altered. Just before 10 a.m. on November 1, 1755—All Saints' Day—a fault line 200 miles or so off the Iberian Coast ruptured, releasing the energy equivalent of 32,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs. So powerful was the earthquake that its effects were felt from the Azores to Sweden. Lisbon suffered the worst of it. ""It began as a slight tremor, followed by a dull and persistent roar,"" writes Molesky. ""Over the course of the next few minutes—and the arrival of two additional tremors—[the earthquake] would bring one of the greatest cities of Europe to its knees."" It is thought to have measured up to a 9.2 on the Richter scale. The city was obliterated. Ten thousand people were dead beneath the ruins of churches, houses, and markets. As the dust settled, the survivors pulled themselves free and gathered to witness and mourn what, even today, must have felt like the apocalypse. Then the tsunami hit. The Atlantic Ocean rarely produces tsunamis, so the people of Lisbon would have been as unprepared for the tidal wave as they were for the earthquake. It seemed to come from nowhere, this wall of water, and so terrible was the tsunami that people as far away asBrazilwere killed. Hundreds of the Lisbon earthquake's survivors emerged from rubble only to be pulled into the Tagus river and sucked into the Atlantic Ocean. This was a mere 30 minutes after the earthquake. Then the fires came. There was no electricity in 1755, but there were an awful lot of candles, and they were all lit to celebrate All Saints' Day. Likewise, stoves and hearths had been primed with strong fires to celebrate the feast day. When the earthquake first hit, those candles and stoves were knocked to the ground, causing hundreds of small fires across the city. With the entirety of the city now reduced to kindling, not only did the fires spread, but they joined to create a literal firestorm that was so powerful in its thirst for oxygen that it could asphyxiate people 100 feet from the blaze—before incinerating them. Thousands of people trapped in rubble—people who had just survived the worst earthquake in European history, and who then survived a rare and terrible tsunami—were burned alive. The firestorm raged for a week, and smaller fires lingered for weeks after. In all, up to 40,000 people were killed in what the day before was the richest, most opulent city in Europe. The city would lay in ruin for years. So sudden and catastrophic was the earthquake that the ruling state ground to a halt. The monarchy was paralyzed with fright, and other government officials had absconded, were dead, or were indisposed. This left a conspicuous vacuum of power soon to be filled by Portugal's secretary of foreign affairs, Marquês de Pombal. He seized the initiative in the chaos, and ""dashed off orders and proclamations with great gusto."" He took control of the recovery effort, and with the king's blessing, assumed the role of a dictator. As Molesky writes, ""One might say he was the earthquake's fourth tremor, so swift and violent was his rise in the weeks after disaster."" To be sure, his actions in the earthquake's aftermath were decisive and oftentimes beneficial. Bodies had to be buried lest disease flourish, and the border and coast had to be secured from invaders and pirates who might take advantage of the chaos. His policies of conscripting vagabonds into forced labor were less favorable, however, as were his price controls on all food and goods, which prevented price gouging but ultimately discouraged vendors ""from assuming the substantial risks of transporting their wares into a disaster zone."" As generally happens when one is made dictator, scores with old enemies were soon settled, freedoms were curtailed, and criticisms suppressed. Enemies who rose up were brutally crushed. (Featured were beheadings, limbs broken before executions, and burnings at the stake.) This ""emergency rule"" continued for more than 20 years, until 1777, when Queen Maria I assumed the throne of Portugal and exiled Pombal. Portugal would never again see its former glory. Weak leadership, wars, revolutions abroad, and invasions at home—all of which might have gone differently or been averted entirely had Lisbon not been destroyed—slowly decomposed the empire and eventually ended the country's global ambitions. ""Portugal was never the same after the earthquake,"" writes Molesky. With the existing order annihilated—the nobility, the church, commercial interests, and the military—the Portuguese empire would begin a decline from which it would never recover. ""The earthquake, in short, had brought about a revolution."" The effects of the catastrophe were felt in other ways across Europe. Paradoxically, it both strengthened and weakened Enlightenment thinking, which was then in full force. Scientists around the world put forth explanations for the earthquake, establishing the fields of seismology and scientific geology in the process. Because scientists were unable to give a compelling reason for all that had transpired, however, the clergy were able to point to the Enlightenment as flawed, and suggest that maybe it was a vengeful God expressing his wrath at a decadent city. The earthquake inspired artists as well—most notably Voltaire, who was then in exile in Switzerland. So infuriated was he at philosophers of the age who, even after the earthquake, called ours ""the best of all possible worlds,"" that he wrote a novel savaging the philosophy of optimism, the church, and the ruling class. InCandide, the destruction of Lisbon is featured. After the earthquake had destroyed three-fourths of Lisbon, the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to prevent utter ruin than to give the people a beautifulauto-da-fé; for it had been decided by the University of Coimbra that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible secret to hinder the earth from quaking. This Gulf of Firereminds us what true devastation looks like, and that it needs no motivation or incitement. Our own nature might lead to our doom, but nature itself is unimpressed with our arguments and unmoved by our cries. ""What a game of chance human life is!""Voltaire wrote. ""[Lisbon] ought to teach men not to persecute men: for, while a few sanctimonious humbugs are burning a few fanatics, the earth opens and swallows up all alike."""
575,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/83070/how-girl-scouts-are-helping-save-environment,,"Today’s Girl Scouts are doing more than earning badges and selling cookies: They’re helping to save the environment.Scientific Americanreports that a new Girl Scouts educational program called GLEE (Girls Learning Environment and Energy) has been teaching Girl Scouts a range of energy conservation strategies with real results. Girl Scouts who participated in the program have successfully improved their energy-saving behaviors by as much as 49 percent. In order to measure the effectiveness of the program, researchers atStanford Universityconducted astudyfollowing 30 Girl Scout troops in Northern California as they participated in two different GLEE programs. In the first, Girl Scouts learned ways to save energy around the house (by turning off lights, taking shorter showers, and so on), while the second taught them about energy expenditure during food production and transportation (by encouraging them to bike instead of drive or reduce their meat intake). While both programs saw an increase in energy-saving activities, the first, which focused on residential energy, was by far the most successful. The Los Angeles Timesexplains that the second group increased energy conservation by a mere 7 percent, while the first increased conservation by 49 percent. Researchers believe the food and transportation program may have been less effective than the residential energy program because, by and large, the children had less direct control over their family's food consumption and transportation decisions—when you're a fifth grader, it's easier to unplug a power strip than convince your parents to bike to work. Eight months after the initial GLEE program, researchers discovered that the food and transportation group had all but ceased their energy-saving activities, while the residential energy group’s energy-saving habits were still up 27 percent compared to their pre-GLEE activities. But perhaps the most remarkable outcome of the study was that the Girl Scouts not only reduced their own energy consumption, but successfully taught their parents new energy-saving habits. Participants of the residential energy GLEE course helped their parents increase their energy-saving behavior by 12 percent (which was still up 6 percent nine months later). The study's results could help researchers develop better environmental education programs. It’s also encouraging to see that even children can have a real impact on the environment, not only learning to curb their own energy use, but teaching others better habits. Or, as Girl Scout Rachel Swan toldScientific American, “I know all of my other friends who were in GLEE with me always went home and talked to their parents…We all had a lot of fun with it because it felt nice being the one to teach your parents things because they always teach you things. You know, return the favor.” [h/tScientific American] Know of something you think we should cover? Email us at tips@mentalfloss.com."

On August 15, a team of 10 researchers will collect the very first samples on the treacherous Mont Blanc massif for a brand-new international ice library housed in an Antarctic cave. TheProtecting Ice Memoryproject aims to preserve the rich information contained in our planet’s swiftly disappearing ice. To those that can read them, mountain glaciers are incredible repositories of data points on long-term changes in temperature, as well as concentrations of gases and pollutants. But as they melt, their histories go with them. So researchers are planning to take enormous, cylindrical samples called ice cores from as many mountaintops as they can, and shelve them in the still-frozen Antarctic. ©BrunoJourdain, CNRS Photo Library It’s an idea similar to, and inspired by, the so-calledDoomsday Seed Vault, a stronghold of hundreds of thousands of seeds that could help restore agricultural supplies in the event of a global food crisis. The seed vault and its precious contents arewell protected, buried 390 feet under the icy ground of a remote island in the Norwegian Arctic. Leaders of the Protecting Ice Memory project are equally concerned about keeping their samples safe, although the threat in this case is global warming. They say that the 426-foot-long ice cores will be passed across the globe through “a strict cold chain” until they reach the French- and Italian-run Concordia Station in Antarctica. The samples’ final destination is a -65°F snow cave that project partner Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) calls “the most reliable and natural freezer in the world.” In addition to Italy and France, the project has found support and interest in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Brazil, the United States, Russia, China, Nepal, and Canada. Carlo Barbante is the project’s Italian leader. ""Our generation of scientists, which bears witness to global warming, has a particular responsibility to future generations,"" he said in the IRD press statement.

577,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/83389/court-rules-navy-must-reduce-use-marine-life-disturbing-sonar,,"For years, the United States Navy has been using long-range sonar to scan the world’s oceans for sneaky submarines. The sonar, which can travel hundreds of miles and generate sound waves up to 235 decibels, is known to cause serious harm to marine animals, making communication all but impossible. But now,The Vergereports, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled [PDF] that the regulation allowing the Navy to use its long-range sonar violates the Marine Protection Act. That means the Navy will soon have to drastically reduce its use of marine life-disturbing sonar. WIREDexplains that the National Marine Fisheries Service previously ruled that the Navy could use its long-range sonar so long as they found no evidence of marine mammals in the area. That meant that as long as there was no record of marine animals in a given region of the ocean (a common phenomenon considering vast swaths of the world’s oceans haven’t been surveyed), the Navy was free to use its sonar. The court has now ruled that in the future, the impetus will be on the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Navy to prove that there are, in fact, no marine animals in an area before using sonar. The ruling marks a great victory for marine animals and environmentalists, who have been trying to reduce the Navy’s use of disruptive sonar for years. In fact, back in 2004, with the help of a human lawyer, the so-called “cetacean community” (all the whales, porpoises, and dolphins in the world) attempted tobring a suitagainst then-president George W. Bush for permitting the Navy’s use of harmful sonar. (The case was dismissed when the judge ruled animals couldn’t sue humans.) This time, it was several environmental NGOs that took the National Marine Fisheries Service to task, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Ocean Futures Society, founded by Jean-Michel Cousteau (son of Jacques Cousteau). It’s hard to overstate how damaging the impact of long-range sonar can be on marine lives. For animals who rely on echolocation to communicate, it can be a matter of life and death. It can have an impact on eating, navigation, and breeding, and according toVocativ, may even cause whales to beach themselves. “It can mean the difference between feeding and not feeding, or breeding and not breeding,” Michael Jasny of the National Resources Defense Council tellsWIRED. “It’s important to understand that the ocean is a world of sound, not sight.” [h/tThe Verge] Know of something you think we should cover?

578,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/83443/coral-reef-bright-spots-yield-clues-save-dark-spots,,"A traditional fisherman on a coral reef in Papua New Guinea. Image credit: Tane Sinclair-Taylor Coral reefs are suffering worldwide. Consider theglobal coral bleachingthat began in 2014 and is still ongoing, making it the longest bleaching event in recorded history. The damage has been catastrophic, affecting 38 percent of all reefs. And yet some reefs are faring better than others. Why? Thecover storyof the current issue ofNatureexplores that question using a decidedly unorthodox approach for the study of biological entities like coral reefs: social science.Joshua Cinnerand his colleagues borrowed the social science strategy of identifying “bright spots”—a tactic previously applied only to human systems such as businesses, organizations, families, villages—to tease out the differences between thriving and dying coral reefs. Cinner, of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, explained tomental_floss, “Bright spots are reefs that have more fish than expected based on their exposure to pressure like human population, poverty, and unfavorable environmental conditions. They’re not necessarily pristine reefs, but reefs that are doing better than they should given their circumstances. They’re essentially punching above their weight.” The long-term goal is to identify how those bright spots are doing well and what contributes to “dark spots”—reefs doing more poorly than others facing similar pressures. Ideally, finding out the differences between these outliers and their peers may allow communities to apply bright-spot strategies to dark spots and improve local reefs. “Most scientific studies look at averages or trends, and there’s a lot of research looking at how global fish stocks are declining,” said Cinner, who led a team of 38 co-authors from 10 countries for the study. “We focused on the outliers, the places that are bucking the trend.” The research was inspired by a presentation Cinner heard at a conference about howmalnutritionin a Vietnamese villagewas alleviated by pinpointing bright spots. Save the Children interviewed Vietnamese families whose children managed to stay well fed despite having no more food than other families. The organization learned that mothers of the healthier children were adding small shrimps they collected from the rice fields to their children’s food and feeding them smaller but more frequent meals. When Save the Children helped these mothers teach other families these strategies, child malnutrition rates dropped. The innovative strategy piqued Cinner’s interest. He thought they might be able to apply a similar approach to coral reef conservation. “All the scientists I was working with really wanted to try something different, so the amount of collaboration I received was really incredible,” he said. “It’s by far the biggest attempt to integrate social and ecological data on coral reefs.” Dozens of marine scientists handed over their data for the project, allowing Cinner’s team to analyze nearly 7000 surveys of 2500 reef sites in 46 states, countries, and territories—the largest global data set available for coral reefs. They used the amount of fish as a measure of health because the fish population is integral to the local ecosystem. When a massive bleaching event occurs, an intact reef fish community can help the reef recover, Cinner said. “No matter how much fish are on a reef, it’s not going to climate-proof that reef or make it resistant to bleaching,” he explained. However, on the “continuous battlefield between coral and algae, carnivorous fish on a reef can keep the algae in check.” Tane Sinclair-Taylor Using aprevious study’s estimate that an unfished reef in average conditions should have approximately 1000 kilograms of biomass (the total weight of all animals) per hectare (kg/ha), he compared this figure to the biomass at each coral reef. The average biomass of coral reefs was 762 kg/ha, but half of all coral reefs had less than 391 kg/ha, revealing a wide variation in reefs across the globe. After taking into account geographical differences of the reefs (slope, depth, shape, and other characteristics), as well as the size, economics, and governance of nearby human populations, Cinner found the biggest influence on coral reef health was the size of the nearest city or port and how accessible the reef was to it. Next, they tried to identify the cause of this reduced biomass. Was it tourism, sedimentation from erosion, agricultural runoff, or fishing? When they compared the biomass of fished versus non-fished species, only the species targeted for catch had smaller populations, indicating that overfishing was the culprit. If sedimentation, tourism, or pollution were to blame, both fished and non-fished species would have suffered proportionally; yet only the fish headed for dinner plates were declining. Then Cinner’s team identified the top 5 percent of coral reefs—15 locations—as bright spots. These reefs have more fish then would be expected and are concentrated mostly in the Pacific and the Indo-Pacific regions. Only one-third were in remote areas while the others were in populated areas, such as the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Bird’s Head Peninsula in Indonesia. They also identified 35 dark spots. Interestingly, they're located near countries representing the entire economic spectrum: lower-income countries (including Kenya and Madagascar), middle-income countries (such as Seychelles and Venezuela), and high-income countries (including the U.S. and Australia). Even protected, remote areas near pristine islands, such as the Northwest Hawaiian Islands, weren’t doing as well as they should be. To learn what was driving the differences, the team interviewed local experts at all the bright spots and dark spots, as well as at 14 average spots. Some differences, such as having deeper water at bright spots or more coral bleaching and cyclones at dark spots, cannot be changed. Others, such as a community’s dependence on a reef, should not be changed because it would affect people’s livelihoods, Cinner said. But other conditions are more malleable. Dark spots had more technology-driven fishing operations that optimized catching and storing fish. For example, they had more access to freezers and more intensive fishing gear such asseine nets, which are huge, weighted horizontal nets that fishermen drag across large areas. Meanwhile, bright spots tended to have better social and institutional conditions, ""with higher levels of engagement from locals in resource management and decision-making,” Cinner said. “This involvement and ownership creates a situation where communities can develop locally appropriate, creative solutions for themselves, and the high dependence on reef resources may create the incentives to create those solutions.” The next step is in-depth field study at bright and dark spots and, eventually, seeing if lessons learned from bright spots can brighten up those dark spots. “Our findings introduce a realm of possibilities for improving the sustainability of reef systems,” Cinner said."

The galaxy we call home is a sight one-third of humanity can no longer see. Image credit: Dan Duriscoe The view of an ink-black, star-studded night sky is becoming a rarity—something only a small fraction of humanity can hope to experience, according to the most detailed study of light pollution compiled so far. “Light pollution” refers to the stray light from vehicles, homes, and industry—a form of pollution that’s often overlooked, but which has been on the rise ever since the invention of electric lighting. It now hampers the view of the night sky for the majority of people around the world. According to an international team of scientists, more than 80 percent of the world’s population now live under light-polluted skies. A smaller fraction—about one-third—live under skies that are murky enough to blot out the Milky Way. A summary of their findings waspublishedtoday in the journalScience Advances. Although long decried by both professional and amateur astronomers, the effects of unchecked light pollution also threaten to affect our lives and our environment in ways that impact more than just astronomy, according to the project’s lead scientist. “Life on earth evolved over millions of years, and normally, it’s been light for half the time, during the day, and dark for half the time, at night,” lead author Fabio Falchi, of the Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute in Italy, tellsmental_floss. “But in the last few decades, things have changed. Now, over large parts of our planet, we have light all day and also all night.” Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and India in New World Atlas of Artificial Sky Brightness, as seen in Google Earth. Image credit: Falchi et al. in Science Advances The extra light can have adverse health effects on humans and other animals, Falchi says, by affecting the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate thecircadian rhythmsthat control the sleep-wake cycle. Falchi and his colleagues have released an updated and expanded edition of a light pollution atlas they first published more than a decade ago. The New World Atlas of Artificial Sky Brightness was compiled by correlating data from NASA’sSuomi NPP satellite(National Polar-orbiting Partnership) together with some 30,000 ground-based light-level measurements. The result is the most accurate assessment yet of the worldwide effects of light pollution. While other kinds of pollution, such as air and water pollution, often take the heaviest tolls in the developing world, light pollution is most pronounced in well-off regions, such as the United States, Europe, and parts of Asia. Some 99 percent of Americans and Europeans live under light polluted skies, the study found. In contrast, in the African nations of Chad, the Central African Republic, and Madagascar, some three-quarters of residents still live under dark skies. In the developed world, some of the darkest skies are found in Canada and Australia. Light pollution over Joshua Tree National Park. And yet—as the National Park Service says—the park has some of the darkest skies in southern California. Image credit: Dan Duriscoe The good news, says Falchi, is that fairly simple measures can be taken to mitigate light pollution. For example, street lights can be equipped with shields that minimize the amount of light that escapes upward. And modern LED lighting can be dimmed more easily than older kinds of lights, allowing them to shine at reduced brightness levels when that’s all that’s needed. Alan Dyer, a Canadian photographer known for hisstunning portraits of the night sky, compares a dark sky to an endangered species of animal—a rare treat which, for some people, is worth traveling a great distance to see. “When you lose contact with the night sky, you really lose contact with your place in the universe,” Dyer tellsmental_floss. “There’s nothing in nature that inspires more curiosity, wonder, and awe than looking up at the stars, and particularly the Milky Way.” Based in rural Alberta, Dyer has easier access to dark skies than most North Americans, but over the last 25 years, he’s seen the lights of Calgary, as well as smaller towns, steadily getting brighter. For Falchi, who lives near Milan in northern Italy, a dark night sky is virtually impossible to find. “A really good night sky is no longer available in Italy,” he says. “I can drive two hours to a fairly good mountain site, but even there, there’s some light pollution.” A few more hours gets him close to the Austrian border, which is darker still, but even there, he notes, the sky is only really dark directly overhead. When he looks southward, toward Italy’s industrial region, an orange glow looms above the horizon."
581,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/81920/wood-fired-pizza-might-be-causing-major-air-pollution-brazil,,"Earlier this year, the tiny, pizza-loving town of San Vitaliano, Italy,made headlineswhen its mayor issued a three-month ban on the use of wood-fired ovens to curb local smog levels. Turns out, San Vitaliano isn’t the only town that’s struggling with the environmental consequences of cooking up the cheesy Italian staple.According to Vox, a new paper published in the journalAtmospheric Environmentsuggests that São Paulo, Brazil’s staggering air pollution levels are partly due to wood-burning ovens found in pizzerias and other restaurants. Home to 21 million people, São Paulo is Brazil’s largest city, and the world’s fifth-largest metropolitan area. And where there are lots of people, there are lots of cars. In fact, the city’s streets and parking lots are filled with approximately 7 million road vehicles. These exhaust-belching vehicles are responsible for most of São Paulo’s air pollution. However, experts from seven international universities, includingDr. Prashant Kumarof the University of Surrey, noted that São Paulo's residents fill their vehicles with a mostly “clean” biofuel comprising sugarcane ethanol, gasohol (75 percent gasoline, 25 percent ethanol), and soya diesel. ""It became evident from our work that despite there not being the same high level of pollutants from vehicles in the city as other megacities, there had not been much consideration of some of the unaccounted sources of emissions,” Kumar, the study’s lead author,said in a release. “These include wood burning in thousands of pizza shops or domestic waste burning."" So Kumar and his colleagues took a closer look at Brazilians’ love affair with pizza, noting that São Paulo’s 8000 pizza parlors produce nearly one million pizzas a day. Many of these parlors still use old-fashioned, wood-burning stoves—which collectively burn 307,000 tons of wood each year. And that’s not even counting the unregulated emissions from steakhouses and other eateries. The study’s researchers concluded that in São Paulo, oven emissions might actually be negating the positive effects of green biofuels—although another co-author, North Carolina State University'sDr. Yang Zhang, noted that most air quality studies in Brazil have focused on the impacts of vehicle emissions, and not on wood and coal burning and meat-cooking in pizzerias and restaurants. So far, the jury’s still out on how much enjoying smoke-charred foods actually contributes to São Paulo's environmental pollution. However, these kitchen staples, along with biomass burning from the neighboring Amazon rainforest, are potentially major factors. Along with tweaking São Paulo’s transportation policy to reduce air pollution, restaurant owners can outfit their ovens with special filters or purifying systems to help curb the damage they’re doing to the environment. It might be a small step to take in response to a large problem, but when you keep in mind that4655 people died as a result of air pollutionin São Paulo in 2011, every little bit helps. [h/tVox]"

TheSan Francisco Examinerexplains that the ban will be enacted in two waves: Starting January 1, 2017, polystyrene food packaging, plates, cups, egg cartons, coolers, to-go containers, pool and beach toys, packaging, dock floats, and buoys will disappear from San Francisco’s stores. Then, on July 1, 2017, polystyrene meat and fish trays will be removed, completing the total ban of styrofoam in the city. The initiative is designed to reduce pollution and help the city reach its goal of achieving “zero waste” by 2020. Styrofoam is notoriously difficult to recycle and often ends up in landfills, where it never fully degrades, and in oceans, where it is often consumed by fish. By banning Styrofoam, San Francisco hopes to reduce its own environmental footprint and especially the amount of polystyrene that ends up at sea. The ordinance was sponsored in part by Supervisor Aaron Peskin, who in 2006 proposed banning polystyrene take-out containers from restaurants. That ordinance was implemented a year later. He told theSan Francisco Examiner, “I’m delighted that San Francisco continues to be a leader on the environmental issues of our day as we’ve got plastic floatin’ in our ocean the size of Texas.” [h/tMother Jones] Know of something you think we should cover?

The park is asking its visitors to toss their pup’s poop in two designated compost bins. Visitors are provided with a range of pooper scoopers and complimentary paper bags to replace non-biodegradable plastic bags. Once enough poop has been collected, park employees ensure that it is mixed with sawdust and “cooked” to reduce smell before applying the brand new fertilizer to plant and flower beds. Leslie Wright, who is the regional director of state parks in New York City, toldThe Postthat the program would be both environmentally friendly and cheap, costing the city around $2000 for supplies and materials. She also explained that Williamsburg was chosen as a test site because its relatively young, hip residents seemed the most likely to embrace the strange and slightly stinky program and recognize its potential to make the city greener. Right now, East River State Park is one of just three parks in the United States turning dog poop into fertilizer. But if the experiment is successful, there could soon be more. After all, there’s an obvious appeal to taking something smelly and unappealing and transform it into something useful. Or as Wright toldThe Post, “We figured we can use something people don’t want and turn it into something great.” [h/tNew York Post]"
584,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/83866/gorgeous-leather-bag-actually-made-pineapples,,"You already know that pineapples are delicious and super rich in Vitamin C, but did you know that they could be transformed into a fabulous purse or great pair of running shoes? It’s hardly a secret that eating a vegan diet is kinder to animals, and many experts believe that a plant-based diet can havelife-changing effectson the health of an individual and even theworld at large. With the number of vegans around the worldon the rise, it’s not just the food industry that needs to adapt. The growing public demand for alternatives to leather and other animal products when it comes to clothing and textiles means that companies are coming up with all sorts of creative options. One London-based company,Ananas Anam, has devised a delicious solution to creating vegan materials: Pineapples. CalledPiñatex, the environmentally-friendly textile is created from the fibers of leftover pineapple leaves, which are extracted through a process known as ""decortication."" Since the leaves are a byproduct of the pineapple harvest, there is no need for extra water, land, fertilizers, or even pesticides to produce the material. It has a low environmental impact, can be easily mass produced and, perhaps most importantly, is affordable for consumers looking to give their wardrobes a socially-conscious makeover. As the pineapple leaves are harvested in the Philippines by local farmers, Ananas Anam’s products are also helping to create more jobs. “The farming communities in the Philippines will benefit from the added income from the extraction of the fiber,” Jeanne Rideau, Ananas Anam’s public relations and communications manager tellsmental_floss. “Moreover, the potential use of biomass, which is the byproduct of the fiber extraction, will give the farmers the opportunity of using natural fertilizers.” Image courtesy Ananas Anam Spanish designer, researcher, and entrepreneurDr. Carmen Hijosais the founder and chief executive officer of Ananas Anam. Hijosa’s first company was based in Ireland, where she designed and manufactured leather products for such companies as Harrods. Her work eventually brought her to the Philippines, where she saw a traditional Filipino shirt made out of pineapple leaves. “As a designer, my objective was to create a product that carried social and ecological responsibility throughout its life cycle, and through it, do something about how to sustain and indeed to heal planet Earth through our actions,” Hijosa says. “Piñatex represents a sustainable solution in the face of today’s social and sustainable dilemmas.” In an interview withCrane.tv, Hijosa explained that to create the final Piñatex material, the pineapple leaf fibers are made into a mesh, which then goes through both ""mechanical and chemical processes to make it into a very strong product"" that can be used to create a variety of products, including clothing, shoes, purses, accessories, and even upholstery. Designed and made by NAE Vegan // Image courtesy Ananas Anam You are probably wondering where to get some cool pineapple shoes of your own. Well, the wait is over—at least in certain parts of the world. A selection of the company’s products are available for purchase in the UK, as well asonline. And well-known brands including Puma and Camper have already madeprototypesusing Piñatex. Perhaps the even bigger question everyone is wondering is: do Piñatex products actually smell like pineapples? “No, there is no smell,” Rideau says. Now you know."

While the damage is extensive, it is not universal—15 of the sampled areas were astonishingly healthy, boasting even more fish than scientists expected to find. One of those areas was the Bird’s Head Seascape in Indonesia. This pristine marine paradise is pretty far off the beaten track, but you can visit from home with the new virtual-reality movieValen’s Reef. Bird’s Head wasn’t always so vibrant. Ten years ago, the seascape’s 2500 islands and reefs were teetering on the edge of complete destruction. Reckless commercial fishing practices (including the use of explosives on coral reefs) had nearly wiped out local fish populations. This was bad news not only for the fish and their habitats, but for the local people who rely on subsistence fishing. But the people of Bird’s Head were not about to let their home and wildlife go without a fight.Joining forceswith the nonprofitConservation International(CI), citizens fought hard against outside fishing interests by implementing strict environmental regulations and sustainable practices. Throughout the campaign, CI had film crews on site, capturing the struggle to restore the reefs in immersive, 360-degree detail. The citizens’ effort paid off big time. CI reports that poaching is down 90 percent and that populations of whales, sharks, rays, and small fish are rebounding in spectacular fashion. “Our oceans are under severe threat but we know one method—community-based conservation—can and does make a measurable difference,” CI senior scientist and executive vice president M.

Instead, former property owner Shawn Murphy will stay in his current digs rent-free for the remainder of his life. In exchange, Scottsdale will own the land it sits on: a portion of the McDowell Sonoran Preserve, a protected desert habitat. TheMcDowell Sonoran Preservewas founded in the early 1900s, and in 1993 Scottsdale decided to set aside 3000 additional acres of natural lands for conservation. Over the years, more land was added, and by 2012, the McDowell Sonoran Preserve was the largest urban preserve in the Americas, making up one-quarter of the city's land area. Today, it includes more than 30,000 acres of desert—and thanks to Scottsdale, it continues to grow. With their latest purchase, the preserve now includes even more contiguous land, and a house to boot. For nearly a decade,Fox 10 reports, officials tried to purchase Murphy’s home, which sits near the popular Tom's Thumb trailhead in the preserve. (Murphy bought the house and its surrounding lands in 1999, before they were officially part of the preserve.) ""It's fully surrounded by the preserve and … the north end of the McDowell Mountains,"" preserve director Kroy Ekblaw toldThe Arizona Republic. ""It's elevated with commanding views of the Verde Valley and the Continental Mountains."" The home’s location was desirable, and city officials also feared that its next owner wouldn’t be as good to the land as its current inhabitants were. ""In some point of time, if they were looking to move, we might get a neighbor who doesn't share the same goals,"" Ekblaw toldThe Arizona Republic. The sale, he said, “puts to bed the issue of any future change. We're not faced with an unknown."" Earlier this month, both parties finally reached a deal: Since Scottsdale appraised the house at $2.69 million but a separate appraiser hired by Murphy valued it at $6.59 million, they compromised and settled for $4 million. (The purchase was paid through a city sales tax that pays for desert preservation.) Murphy scored a pretty sweet deal: He lives in the house for free, and he can even rent it out for half the year. However, he has to foot the bill for utilities, maintenance, and insurance. When he dies, the city will likely either use the home as part of the preserve or tear it down,ABC News 12 reports. Scottsdale officials have mixed feelings about the home purchase. They know it was expensive, but ""we don't like the idea of condemning someone's home for a park,"" Mayor Jim Lane toldThe Arizona Republic. ""I think we settled on a reasonable amount.""

The prognosis seems grim. But every so often, we see a glimmer of hope. The latest? Researchers in the Antarctic report that a tear in the ozone layer above the continent is showing signs of healing. They published their findings in the journalScience. For those of us who haven’t seen the inside of an Earth science classroom in years, here’s a quick refresher. The ozone layer is a blanket of ozone gas that wraps around our planet, shielding us from nearly all of the Sun’s radiation. Without this blanket, we’d be toast. Butpollutionhas rent holes in this protective layer, leaving the planet and its inhabitants vulnerable to, you know, being burnt to a crisp. So yeah, it’s pretty serious. Some of the best-known culprits in ozone weakening are chemical compounds called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were, for a time, widely used in popular products and appliances like aerosol sprays and air conditioners. By 1987, CFC-linked damage to the ozone layer was so severe that nations around the worldsigned a pact, agreeing to ban the chemicals. Apparently, the ban is working. Studies over the last 10 years have suggested that the ozone layer has begun to patch itself up in certain places, and the latest research in Antarctica bears that out. Lead author Susan Solomon is an atmospheric scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She and her colleagues have been monitoring the Antarctic ozone hole for years, looking at its area, height, and chemical profile. They now report that, from 2000 to 2015, the size of hole has shrunk by millions of square miles. “We as a planet have avoided what would have been an environmental catastrophe,” SolomontoldAlexandra Witze inNature.“Yay us!” Climate scientists estimate that even if the Antarctic hole continues closing at this rate, it won’t completely heal over until at least the year 2100, and the Arctic ozone hole showsno signs yetof mending.

Researchers at the University of Wollongong, Australia think they've found a way to make the process easier by transforming spilled oil into a magnetic substance,New Scientistreports. As they laid out in their research, recently published in the journalACS Nano, the component that makes their procedure possible is iron oxide. When added to a small tank of water contaminated with oil, iron oxide nanoparticles bonded to the oil droplets, making them magnetic. A simple bar magnet was effective in dragging out the oil while leaving the water behind. It's still unclear whether the success of the lab experiment can be replicated in the real world. For large-scale oil spills, researcher Yi Du tellsNew Scientistthe particles could be dispersed over the ocean and collected by ships outfitted with magnets. Iron oxide is a nontoxic compound, and any excess particles that don't latch onto the oil could theoretically be sucked up with magnets and used in the future. The 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill no longer dominates the news, but its effects are still being felt in the Gulf of Mexicoyears later. On top of the millions of barrels of harmful oil that flooded the sea, even moretoxic chemicalswere sprayed to break it up.

In April 2016, the cats weredeclared extinctin Cambodia. That same month, though, tiger conservationists announced some good news: though still small, tiger populationswere growingfor the first time in a century. And it’s due, in no small part, to the indigenous tribes that have learned to coexist peacefully with the predators, theBBCreports. There are approximately 3890 tigers in the wild now, compared to about 3200 in 2010, according to the World Wildlife Fund. Survival International, a UK nonprofit devoted to indigenous rights, argues that tiger conservation works better when local tribes are involved. In India’s BRT Tiger Reserve, where tigers live alongside the Soliga people, the species' population is increasing at higher rates than elsewhere in India, where locals have been forced to move out of tiger reserves. BRT’s tiger population nearly doubled from 2010 to 2014, increasing from 35 tigers to 68. In 2014, about3000people were evicted from the Kanha Tiger Reserve, the location that inspired Rudyard Kipling’sJungle Book. India’s Wildlife Protection Act created human-free reserves in certain forest areas, including those that tigers use to breed, but didn’t account for the locals who had lived there for generations.In 2006, the country—which is home to70 percentof the world’s tigers—passed a law allowing indigenous peoples to remain in the forests, causing strife with conservationists determined to keep tigers from the harm inflicted by human society. However, Survival International is not the only organization to dispute that suggestion. The BBC also turned up a 2016 study thatfoundthat in India’s Bor Tiger Reserve, local villagers “considered [tigers] a boon and beneficial to their livelihood, and almost all displayed environmental awareness and stressed the necessity to conserve tigers in order to ensure their own continued survival.” The tiger also has religious significance, as it is the animal ridden by the goddess Durga in Hindu mythology. As such, locals are more interested in living peacefully alongside the animals than poaching them or encroaching on their hunting grounds. “We worship tigers as gods,” as one man living in the BRT Tiger Reserve toldSurvivor International. “There hasn’t been a single incident of conflict with tigers and Soligas or hunting here.""

Published inProceedings of the Royal Society Band reported byGizmodo, the analysis was based on 13 years of citizen scientist-submitted data on the dates when various types of trees have budded in the UK. The University of Exeter researchers found that between 1999 and 2011, urban areas with more light pollution at night saw trees budding an average 7.5 days earlier than darker regions, where the onset of spring basically didn’t change. They compared tree-budding dates with nighttime satellite imagery and weather data on air temperature, and found that cites’ early spring wasn’t entirely due to the urban heat island effect—which describes the fact that the ubiquitous hard surfaces and lack of greenery in cities make them hotter than surrounding regions—asprevious researchsuggested. We already know that modern urban lighting is terrible for human health, disrupting circadian rhythms and potentially even contributing to increased rates ofbreast cancer. It also affects the ecosystem, impactinginsect communities,fatally disorienting birdsandtrapping in beams of light, and more.

The Church of the Nativity, first built in 339 A.D. and then restored after a fire in the mid-6th century, is the oldest Christian church still in daily use. The church’s roof needs restoring, and the increase in vehicular traffic and industry to the area have caused pollution, which has impacted both the church and other buildings along what is known as the Pilgrimage Route. In 2013, a plan to restore the church and better manage its surrounding area was put into effect; in 2014, the church saw itsfirst repairs in over 500 years.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Liverpool was a major trading center and aided the growth of the British Empire. It became a port for the import/export of slaves, emigrants, and non-human cargo. Six locations comprise the city: The Pier Head, with three buildings; The Albert Dock, including warehouses and offices; The Stanley Dock; the Duke Street Conservation Area; The Cultural Quarter, with its statues and civic buildings; and the Commercial Quarter, including Liverpool Town Hall. Liverpool Waters, a proposed construction project, is the main concern here, as UNESCO wants any new construction to “complement the historic Pier Head buildings.” Because of the new construction threat, in 2012 the port landed on the endangered list. Built in the 5th century,Timbuktubecame an intellectual region for the spread of Islam throughout West Africa in the 1400s and 1500s. Three mosques and 16 mausoleums comprise the site, which is located near the gateway to the Sahara, which made it a prime location for the trading of gold and salt. Because the buildings are so antiquated, they require careful maintenance, and there’s a constant threat of urbanization. From 1990 to 2005, it was on the endangered list but was removed when the architecture was fixed. However in 2012, an Islamic terrorist group associated with Al-Qaedadestroyedthe entombed grave of Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar, saying they considered idolatry a sin.

The biggest problem facing Garamba is uncontrollable poaching. In 2014, Congolese and South Sudan poachersmurdered 68 elephantsin a two-month period. In 2015,poachers killedthree park rangers and a military officer who were trying to protect the elephants. In the 1960s, the elephant population was 20,000; in 2012 it was only 2000. Because of the renegade poachers—who attack from helicopters—the situation continues to be dire. Another Congo site—this one located in a Congolese tropical forest—Kahuzi-Biega National Parkcontains two extinct volcanoes (the park is named after them) and a population of about 250 lowland gorillas. The park also contains 13 other primates including chimps, a variety of other mammals, and over 349 bird species. In 1980 it became an UNESCO site, and in 1997 it became endangered—largely due to its population of rare animals. Poaching is a huge concern, and so is the lack of security, a buffer zone, management, and political instability causing the human population to be displaced. 10. ANCIENT CITY OF ALEPPO // SYRIA Ramzi Haidar /AFP/Getty Images TheAncient City of Aleppo—once an intersection for many trade routes—was designated a UNESCO site in 1986 and landed on the endangered list in 2013 as a result of theBattle of Aleppo, which has led to much of the city being destroyed. But plans are in the works to restore the city and to add a buffer zone to protect Aleppo from further damage. Besides Aleppo, Syria’s ancient cities of Bosra and Damascus; villages of North Syria, Crac des Chevaliers, and Qal’at Salah El-Din; and Palmyra are also on the endangered list. The capital of Yemen from the 13th to 15th centuries,Zabidalso became an entryway to the spread of Islam throughout the country, mainly because of its 86 mosques that educated the masses. UNESCO inscribed the city in 1993 in appreciation of the domestic and military architecture of watchtowers and citadels, but deemed it endangered in 2000. Insufficient upkeep over the past 15 years, the use of concrete and corrugated steel sheeting, and the addition of electricity have caused the buildings to deteriorate to the point where up to 40 percent of the structures are weak. To combat further decay, an infrastructure improvement project was instilled in 2004. 12. EAST RENNELL // SOLOMON ISLANDS Public Domain,Wikimedia Commons Located in the South Pacific, the Solomon Islands are hard to get to, but that doesn’t exclude them from threats.East Rennellmakes up the southern third of Rennell Island and is the southernmost island in the archipelago. It’s also the largest raised coral atoll in the entire world. The island’s mostly covered by dense forest, but they have Lake Tegano, which is home to a variety of endemic species. The island has about 1200 residents, who rely on the land for sustenance; among the plants they harvest are taro and coconut, both of which are becoming scarce because of rising sea levels and climate change. Eleven types of bats live on the island, along with 730 insect species, and 27 kinds of land snails, leading UNESCO to refer to Rennell as “a true natural laboratory for scientific study.” Besides the climate change issue, logging, mining, and commercial fishing have thrown Rennell onto the endangered list. A National Protected Areas Act, passed in 2010, is helping to preserve the area. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Spanish empire built several batteries, castles, and forts to protect transatlantic trade. Some of them look like that fortress from the season one finale ofTrue Detective, and were just as effective.Portobelo and San Lorenzo, the fortifications on the Caribbean side of Panama, are divided by sections; San Fernando, near the Bay of Portobelo, includes Lower Battery, Upper Battery, and Hilltop Stronghold. Santiago contains castles and ruins, and the Chagres River has the San Lorenzo Castle. Its military architecture, most of which still stands today, is one of the reasons UNESCO inscribed the site in 1980, but decay from urban growth and lack of maintenance landed it on the endangered list in 2012. Despite many legislations and plans being enacted over the years, effective protection and management remains a pivotal issue. 14. HUMBERSTONE AND SANTA LAURA SALTPETER WORKS // CHILE By Hermann Luyken - Own work (Own picture),CC BY-SA 3.0 Saltpeter, better known as potassium nitrate, is used in fertilizers and fireworks. From 1880 to around 1960,pampinos(workers) mined the salt during harsh conditions in the middle of Chile’s Pampas desert. Once production left the area in the 1960s, it basically became a ghost town; in 1970 it was declared a National Monument and opened up to tourists. When the site was in production, it generated the largest deposit of saltpeter in the world, transforming agriculture as we know it, and making Chile a rich country. Over 200 works remain, from a swimming pool to a railway to the refineries of Santa Laura and Humberstone, the more successful of the two refineries. Because of salt water mist drifting in from the Pacific Ocean damaging metals, an earthquake, and lack of maintenance, UNESCO added the site to its endangered list in 2005. Believed to be constructed in 850 A.D.,Chan Chanwas once the capital city of the Chimor empire with an estimated population of about 40,000 to 60,000. The city—the largest in pre-Columbian America—was at is peak in the 15th century, just before it fell to the Incas. The site was marked as endangered in 1986, because of its vulnerability to climate change. The site has been further threatened because of frequent plundering of its remains, and the proposed construction of a road that would cross the city."

A new study suggests that, to date, we’ve found more than 11,000 tree species in the region’s rainforests and savannas, but there are at least another 4000 out there, waiting to be discovered. If we keep spotting them at our current pace, researchers say, catching them all could take us another three centuries. They discussed their findings in the journalScientific Reports. Before the researchers could speculate on those known unknowns, they had to tally up the, well, known knowns. The team knew that the Amazon—the largest rainforest in the world, spanning nine countries—is home to around 1300 species of birds, 427 species of mammals, and 50,000 species of seed plants. And thanks to an earlier study, they had a pretty good guess of the number of tree species: 16,000. But that was just an estimate. To date, nobody had counted. So the team, which included botanists from six countries, dug into museum collections around the world and started counting. They reviewed more than half a million specimens from the last 308 years. The final tally was 11,676 different tree species, each one a unique thread in the Amazon’s vivid and varied tapestry. Think about that for a moment. How many different trees can you name off the top of your head? Got a number? Good. Now multiply it by alot. The team’s sum total doesn’t invalidate the earlier estimate of 16,000 species. Quite the opposite, in fact. Based on the number we’ve found so far, and the rate at which we’ve been collecting and discovering them, the authors believe we’ve got at least another 4000 to track down. Doing that could take a while, says study co-author Nigel Pitman, senior conservation ecologist at The Field Museum in Chicago. “Since 1900, between 50 and 200 new trees have been discovered in the Amazon every year,” he said in a press statement. “Our analysis suggests that we won’t be done discovering new tree species there for three more centuries.” Will there even be an Amazon in 300 years? That remains to be seen. Deforestation levels have decreased in the last few years, but hardly stopped. “If deforestation were to increase to levels of the early 2000s,” the authors write, “most of the rare—and possibly unknown—species in eastern and southern Amazonia would face threat of extinction.” Know of something you think we should cover?

We now know that things likeplastic containersand fossil fuels are harmful to our bodies and our planet, but we're far from replacing them with the alternatives, and we’re not about to stop buying bottles or driving cars. On the fuel front, at least, we may have made some progress: Scientists say they’ve found a simple, cheap way to get energy out of common lawn grass. They published their findings in theProceedings of the Royal Society A. It’s not like we haven’t been trying to come up with other options. Scientists are working hard to find viable ways to turn things like corn, used deep-fryer oil, andalgaeinto energy, but we’re still not there yet. One of renewable energy’s rising stars is hydrogen, which has a lot to offer as a form of fuel. For one thing, it’s the most abundant element in the universe, appearing in our water, our air, and our plants. It burns efficiently and cleanly without letting off any toxic or greenhouse gases. The trouble is that while hydrogen may beinlots of things, it can be hard to get itout. Scientists all over the world are attacking the problem from different angles. At the Cardiff Catalysis Institute and Queens University Belfast, chemical engineers began wondering how hard it would be to get the super-fuel out of common plants like lawn grass (which is itself environmentally problematic—one NASA research scientist estimated that our much-watered lawns constitute thelargest irrigated cropin the U.S.). They used a technique called photocatalysis, which uses sunlight and a chemical catalyst to squeeze hydrogen out of cellulose (a polymer that gives plants their shape and rigidity). The experimental design was relatively simple: The team put samples of cellulose into large flasks and added one of three catalysts—palladium, nickel, or gold—to each. Then they set the flasks under a lamp and measured how much gas each cellulose/catalyst combination produced. The results were encouraging. All three catalyst-plant combinations responded to the light. The team was glad to see gold and palladium respond, but it was nickel—which is both cheap and abundant—that really got them excited. To confirm their findings, the researchers repeated the experiment, this time using real lawn grass, which is easier to acquire than pure cellulose. The results held: Lawn grass and nickel really were a good, cheap match. ""This really is a green source of energy,”saidco-author Michael Bowker of the Cardiff Catalysis Institute in a press release. These are, of course, early findings, so don’t start mailing your lawn clippings to the lab just yet. But Bowker is hopeful. ""Hydrogen is seen as an important future energy carrier as the world moves from fossil fuels to renewable feedstocks,” he said, “and our research has shown that even garden grass could be a good way of getting hold of it.""

That's why Sweden is launching a program to help trucks go green, as part of a larger initiative to eliminate their fossil fuel dependence by 2030.Forbesreports that Sweden is developing an electric highway—or eHighway—that lets specially-made hybrid trucks run on electricity. The eHighway is currently being tested on an about 1-mile stretch of highway in Sweden. It allows hybrid trucks to connect to an overhead electricity system called a catenary, which is similar to the electric wire systems used by many trolleys and trains in the United States. Unlike trolleys, however, truckers can connect and disconnect their vehicle from the catenary at will, allowing them to change lanes, adjust speed, and drive on highways that aren’t equipped with the catenary yet. The eHighway system was developed by the Swedish company Scania and Germany company Siemens. So far, they have built two diesel hybrid trucks to test out the eHighway during a two-year trial period. They have also announced plans to try out the eHighway in the United States, and recently began installing a two-mile trial eHighway near Los Angeles. According to Anders Berndtsson of the Swedish Transport Administration, the eHighway will allow Sweden to cut down on fossil fuels without drastically changing its infrastructure. “By far the greatest part of the goods transported in Sweden goes on the road, but only a limited part of the goods can be moved to other traffic types,” Berndtsson toldForbes. “That is why we must free the trucks from their dependence on fossil fuels, so that they can be of use also in the future. Electric roads offer this possibility and are an excellent complement to the transport system.” In the video below, Siemens outlines how the eHighway system unites new and existing technologies to create a novel strategy for cutting down on pollution, explaining, “The eHighway system combines the advantages of electrified railways with the flexibility of truck transport.” [h/tForbes]"

That was one of the objectives of a recent expedition led by Kerrie Mengersen of Queensland University of Technology's School of Mathematical Sciences. While visiting the Peruvian jungle, Mengersen and her team used GoPros to film 360-degree footage of various habitats. Along with mathematical and statistical modeling, the virtual reality experiences are intended to give scientists an immersive view of an environment without having to be there in person. This could prove useful when choosing sites for jaguar corridors, the large areas of land the cats use to travel between different parts of the jungle. When viewing a habitat virtually, experts will be able to search for nearby water sources, signs of human life, or fruiting trees that could potentially attract prey. Having a better understanding of these factors could help conservationists make smarter decisions when buying land and building wildlife corridors.

600,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/80580/vulturepocalpyse-coming-and-its-bad-news,,"Vultures that are used to consume the bodies of the dead in a traditional Tibetan sky burial gather before a funeral near the Larung Wuming Buddhist Institute on November 1, 2015. Image credit: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images Vultures are in trouble. Worldwide, 73 percent of vulture species are endangered or near threatened with extinction; only six of 22 species aren't threatened. The problem is particularly bad in Africa and on the Indian subcontinent, where the birds are mostly killed by poisons and a veterinary anti-inflammatory drug used on livestock, finds a new study in the journalBiological Conservation[PDF] byEvan BuechleyandÇağan Şekercioğluof the University of Utah. The prospect of losing the unattractive, bald-headed carrion-eaters may not seem alarming for humans, but it is. Ecosystems and humans alike rely on vultures, and not only because otherwise we'd be knee-deep in carcasses. Vultures don’t just eat dead things, they do it very, very well—a group can eat a carcass in 30 minutes flat—and their finely honed efficiency puts other scavengers to shame. A bearded vulture eating dog vertebrae. Image credit: Evan Buechley For example, at a slaughterhouse where Buechley studies vultures in Ethiopia, “They put out the remains of maybe 60 cows that were slaughtered in a night, and in a few hours, it is totally picked clean. And then you go to another site that is dominated by dogs, and it is just disgusting, completely disgusting,” he says. Vultures are specialists. They eat only dead things, and they are so well adapted to their diet thattheir stomachs killmost viruses and bacteria. When vultures go missing, more disease-ridden scavengers—feral dogs, hyenas, and jackals—tend to take their place. These animals are slower and less thorough at disposing of carcasses, which can spread diseases like rabies, Ebola, and plague the longer they sit around. In India, where vulture populations crashed by 99 percent between 1993 and 2003, the feral dog population boomed by 7 million despite government efforts to control it, causing an estimated 48,000 more human deaths from rabies. The culprit behind this massive decline in vulture populations on the Indian subcontinent was a single drug given to cattle to prevent inflammation: diclofenac, which causes kidney failure in vultures when they eat the cattle carcasses. But the story of South Asia’s vultures is in many ways a regulation success story. In 2006, India, Pakistan, and Nepal banned the production of veterinary diclofenac. “The ban actually was pretty effective,” saysRick Watson, director of international programs at the Peregrine Fund. But diclofenac for humans was still for sale in 30-milliliter doses—large enough to give cattle—until 2015. Now it’s sold in human-sized 3-milliliter doses only, and the subcontinent’s vulture populations have stabilized. “The big caveat is that several species are still critically endangered,” Buechley says. “We still have to be very cautious. “In Africa, I think it’s a darker story. It’s more troubling and more ominous.” The lappet-faced vulture is found in many African countries. Image credit: Evan Buechley Vultures face different threats in Africa. First, farmers and herders poison them accidentally. Because lions eat their livestock, farmers lace carcasses with poison to try to kill the cats—but instead, they end up killing the vultures who swoop in for a meal. This is illegal but not often prosecuted. Second, ivory poachers poison vultures deliberately because their circling can alert law enforcement to poaching activity. “A big boom in ivory poaching has occurred in Africa in the last seven years,” Buechley says. One poisoned elephant carcass alone killed 600 vultures in Namibia in 2013. And third, vultures are intentionally killed for their heads and feet, believed to bestow clairvoyance in traditional medicine in southern Africa. “Poisoning has become much more prevalent over a much bigger area in the last decade or so, so populations are crashing,” Watson says. However, many of Africa’s vulture deaths can be traced back to cheap and available poisons, especially the highly toxic insecticide carbofuran. To conserve these efficient feathered cleanup crews, Buechley recommends “national and international bans on the use and the production of some of these toxins.” The EU does not yet ban the use of diclofenac. “Companies manufacturing these drugs that are cheap and widely used are based in the U.S. and Europe,” Buechley says. “So bringing some of that culpability home to Western civilization is important. Our society is both producing and prospering off some of this death and destruction. “But I don't think we can legislate our way out of this,” he adds. Both he and Watson think it’s critical to also work with communities to address their needs, the way the Peregrine Fund is working with the Maasai in southern Kenya to build sturdier, solar power–lit enclosures to keep their cattle safe from lions and other predators at night. Though the problems are large and complex, Watson is hopeful about the local work that’s currently going on in Africa. “It needs to be scaled up, and I think that’s feasible,” he says. The least we can do for such consummately professional scavengers is to capably work at conserving them."

That frequency—a result of oil and gas operations—has meant thatearthquakesare now present in states where they don't naturally occur. Processes like hydraulic fracturing (fracking) produce a byproduct of polluted water, and drilling companies dispose of it by injecting the wastewater into underground waste wells. The added pressure beneath the surface sometimes causes faults to shift, resulting in small quakes that wouldn't have occurred otherwise. Of fracking, the USGS writes: ""Many questions have been raised about hydraulic fracturing … USGS studies suggest that this process is only rarely the cause of felt earthquakes.""

According to arecent studyby the Energy Department’s Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), America’s rooftops are full of untapped potential. In fact, up to 39 percent of America’s energy could be generated just by installing photovoltaic (PV) solar panels on urban rooftops. Popular Sciencereports that NREL analyzed rooftops in 128 cities across the United States, representing about 23 percent of all buildings in the U.S., according to an NRELpress statement. The researchers assessed the buildings' suitability for hosting PV solar panels and measured how much power could be generated by each location. They found that 83 percent of small buildings had the technical potential to host PV panels on part of their rooftop areas, while 26 percent could host an entire rooftop’s worth of panels. Researchers say that their findings far exceeded previous estimates of the amount of power that could be generated by rooftops alone. Their analysis estimates that rooftops have a technical potential of 1118 gigawatts of capacity and 1432 terawatt-hours of annual energy generation, which would equal 39 percent of America’s total electricity sales (based on 2013 numbers). However, it’s important to note that researchers analyzed technical potential only. That is, they considered resource availability and the availability of space without also analyzing economic or political factors—which means that while America may have the space for rooftop solar panels, it may not currently have the political will or a plan of action.

Besides having a terrific name, this creature is fascinating—one that scientists insist is an underrated but valuable member of ocean ecosystems. A team of researchers recently published a report on the sea cucumber and its importance in the journalConservation Genetics. Like all sea cucumbers,H. edulisis essentially a squishy tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. It rests during the day and emerges to hunt at night, using its little tentacles to shove seafloor garbage and sediment into its mouth. It then poops out clean, freshly oxygenated sand. Think of it as the ocean's very own carpet steamer. Also much like other sea cucumbers, whenH. edulisfeels threatened, it canliterally puke its guts out, ejecting its organs into the surrounding water. Believe it or not,H. edulisand some of its relatives sometimes have a hard time finding mates or ideal mating conditions. Fortunately, they’ve got a backup plan: asexual reproduction. The problem with solo baby-making is that it effectively dries up the gene pool. An increase in asexual reproduction (the most concentrated form of inbreeding) means adecrease in genetic diversity, which is bad for the species' long-term prospects. Reduced genetic diversity in animals like sea cucumbers may indicate that they’ve started going it alone. Previous studies have shown that other sea cucumber species are more likely to reproduce asexually in contaminated waters. Because of this, a sea cucumber’s genes can tell biologists a lot about how the animals and their environment are doing. These days, unfortunately, many sea cucumbers are not doing so well. Ocean pollution and habitat destruction are shrinking available safe space. Sea cucumbers are also valued as both food and medicine in some parts of the world, and some of those areas have only recently implemented regulations to prevent overfishing. Dried sea cucumbers for sale in Hong Kong. Image Credit: ©Steve Taylor One such area is Okinawa, Japan, home to our friend the burnt hot dog sea cucumber. To check up onH. edulispopulations, a team of scientists dove to find them at six points around the main island. The researchers then just snipped a small bit of tissue from each animal’s outer body wall before returning it to its home. Back on land, the researchers sequenced each animal’s DNA and compared the results. ""The data tell a story,"" study co-author Iria Fernandez-Silvasaidin a press statement. ""We saw low genetic diversity in some sea cucumber populations along Okinawa's eastern coastline, where water is polluted by nearby industry, runoff, and coastal development. In contrast, populations in more pristine sites on the island's west coast were more genetically diverse. Since populations appeared disconnected from one another, we can predict that overfishing might be the last straw for vulnerable sea cucumber populations ill-equipped for a comeback."" Why does this matter? Think back toH.edulis's nighttime seafloor cleanups and their role as the ocean's carpet steamer. ""It's easy to underestimate the sea cucumber,"" Fernandez-Silva said. ""Sea cucumbers look goofy, move slowly, and barf up their guts when startled, but these invertebrates are superstar ocean cleaners that are hugely important to marine ecosystems.” Fernandez-Silva and her colleagues say it’s up to Japan to set an example of good marine stewardship. Tighter environmental and fishing restrictions may be the only way to preserve this vital part of the ecosystem. ""Where ocean life is concerned, looks aren't everything,"" says Fernandez-Silva. ""We urge global communities to speak up in defense of important marine species, even those that look like burned hot dogs.”"

Microscopic animals called tardigrades—nicknamed “water bears” and “moss piglets”—amble about on eight clawed legs, their sharp round mouths piercing the moss to get a meal. Some tardigrade species are predators, gobbling up other tiny soil inhabitants, like rotifiers—glassy tube-like creatures as slight as a hair, with hard jaws. Rotifers, in turn, are hunting bacteria or other microorganisms in the capillaries of water that form between soil particles. Meanwhile, some of those bacteria may be chomping up dead organisms and other organic matter, shooting out nutrients that feed the moss and other plants.

Thank the phylum Actinobacteria, with various species cultivated here on artificial substrates made with jelly-like substances and nutrients such as oatmeal. Members of one genus,Streptomyces, are capable of producing a wide variety of antibiotics with numerous properties: antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, antiparasitic, insecticide, and weed controlling.

There are also uncountable lesser-known soil creatures such as coneheads, nematodes, pseudoscorpions, springtails, and stramenopiles. Less than a single teaspoon of soil may contain billions of individual microbes representing tens of thousands of species—more organisms than there are humans on the planet—and yet scientists estimate that they’ve only identified around 1 percent of the microbes that live in soil. The pseudoscorpion is a tiny arachnid that lacks the elongated postabdomen and venomous sting of a real scorpion. Considering its size—usually less that 5 mm long—it's surprisingly long lived, surviving up to four years. Image credit: Andy Murray Nematodes, or roundworms, are soil microfauna.

Many of the 14,000 known ant species are among them. Image credit: Valentin Gutekunst via Flickr According to the atlas, the known soil biodiversity across the world correlates closely with the biodiversity aboveground, including plants and animals. But soil is more than a habitat for hidden flora and fauna. It’s also a vital natural resource, just like water and air. “Soil is the living, breathing skin of our planet,” the authors note. In addition to living organisms, it’s made of organic matter, minerals, and water. It’s a major carbon sink, storing carbon dioxide that could contribute to climate change if it were to escape. The living things within it each play a role. Microbes, for example, eat organic matter and spit out vital nutrients that help plants grow, while the paths of wriggling invertebrates like insects and worms let air and water circulate. Plant roots help hold the soil in place, preventing erosion, and provide niche ecosystems where countless species thrive. Without soil, our planet wouldn’t function, and neither would we: An estimated 99 percent of our food comes from terrestrial agriculture. “We can’t eat and we can’t have clean air unless we have plants in soil,” says Diana Wall, a soil scientist at Colorado State University and the scientific chair of the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative. “And soils have to be healthy to grow these trees and forests, and the food we eat.” Soil also isn’t easy to regenerate. Depending on the climate and the type, it can take a hundred to thousands of years to form mere centimeters. “Within our lifetime, [soil] is a nonrenewable resource,” says Valerie Behan-Pelletier, an acrologist and emeritus research associate with the Canadian National Collection of Insects and Arachnids, as well as an atlas author. “Our food, our fresh water—the quality of so many things in life is dependent on soil.” One in five animals on Earth is thought to be a nematode. These transparent aquatic organisms are classified into five groups based on their morphology and the shape and size of their mouthparts: bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores, plant parasites, and predators. Predaceous nematodes like this one have one or more large teeth or a pointed spear that they use to attack and ingest small animals such as enchytraeids, tardigrades, rotifers, protists—and other nematodes.

It may not be pretty, but it is enduring: a naked mole-rat can live for up to 31 years.

Image credit: Yoshichika Awoki Since soil is such a vital resource, the new biodiversity atlas was originally intended for policymakers, Wall says, to help guide decisions on agriculture policy, biodiversity initiatives, and any other regulations that might affect soil. But the project soon became a potential resource for scientists from other areas of study, Wall adds. That’s not surprising considering the construction of the atlas: It took three years and a multidisciplinary team of 121 scientists, which made it easy for other researchers to hear about the work. “One of the problems we have is that the other disciplines do not quite perhaps realize the importance of soils—the global issues as they relate to science,” says Rattan Lal, a soil scientist at the Ohio State University, who wasn’t involved with the atlas. “Soil science is a kind of synthesis of lots of disciplines: biology, chemistry, physics, hydrology, microbiology. We need other disciplines to study processes of soil.” The atlas is important, Lal adds, because it is “bringing a scientific issue to a broader audience.” Global distribution of the main soil types, from lime-rich calcisols (bright yellow) and peat-rich histosols (dark gray) to andosols (bright red)—the result of volcanic ejections—and nutrient-poor ferralsols (deep orange). Because climate plays an important role in soil formation, soils generally differ from one major climatic zone to another. Image credit: Joint Research Centre In addition to showing where soils are and what lives in them , the atlas lists soil’s biggest threats. These include agriculture, climate change, soil erosion, certain invasive species, pollution, and loss of diversity of plants and other aboveground life. These pressures may increase as the global population grows and demands for food and fiber rise. There are hotspots of plant species loss in Brazil and India, for example, as well as trends toward plant loss in areas where we grow food and build homes, which likely corresponds to drops in soil biodiversity. Agriculture is one of the most intense ways we use soil, and it currently takes up more than 40 percent of our land, according to the atlas; the more we work the land, the more it may reduce certain soil invertebrates. And everyday byproducts of modern civilization, including oil, pesticides, and heavy metals, can change the distribution of organisms living in the soil in both immediate and long-lasting ways. Heavy metals, for example, can alter the metabolism of plants and soil microbes, while certain pesticides don’t discriminate between beneficial species and pathogens or pests (although soil communities may be able to bounce back or build resistance if pesticides are managed well). Enchytraeidae are a family of annelida (class oligochaeta), resembling small white earthworms that are found both on land and in water. They can only be identified when alive because the taxonomy uses external and internal structures, which can be clearly seen only through the living transparent body. Image credit: Andy Murray Research pinpointing current soil biodiversity on farms could set a baseline for the future, to monitor how that biodiversity changes in soils that grow food and support livestock. It may also point to ways to keep the soil healthy. But an even more important feature of the atlas may be what it doesn’t show, says Noah Fierer, one of the authors as well as a microbial ecologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “One of the values is that it highlights what we don't know, and that’s oftentimes more than what we do know.” Understanding those knowledge gaps, Fierer adds, helps point scientists to where more work needs to be done. The maps in the atlas are far from complete, and scientists don’t understand the roles that the vast majority of soil organisms play in soil. Consider the rotifers that are dodging hungry water bears in your hunk of mossy soil. Although scientists have identified 2030 rotifer species, know their peculiar asexual mating habits, and have figured out that the critters can spend long periods of time in suspended animation, their role in the soil food web is mostly a mystery. Rotifers are minute multicellular organisms 0.05 to 3 mm long with mostly transparent bodies subdivided into a head, trunk, and a foot. Across species, they're sexually dimorphic, and the females are always larger. One class, Bdelloidea, evolved entirely without sexual reproduction and are assumed to have reproduced without sex (parthenogenetically) for many millions of years. There are no male Bdelloids. Image credit: Hendrik Segers If scientists can’t get a better handle on soil communities as they exist today, certain biodiversity could be lost forever. “One thing at stake is you don’t know what you’re missing until it’s gone,” says Penny Hirsch, a soil microbiologist at Rothamsted Research, who wasn’t on the atlas team. The working hypothesis on soil has been that its inhabitants may have overlapping functions, which means losing one might not necessarily hurt the overall health of the ecosystem. For example, if multiple species feed on the same type of fungi and keep it in check, and one of those species is wiped out, the others may be able to pick up the slack. Still, says Hirsch, “the implications of not knowing are perhaps that we aren’t sure what to look for if things go wrong.” The next step for the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative is to get a more precise snapshot of the soil in specific countries, says Wall. This will provide data on current biodiversity, historical and possible future trends, and overall health. It could also help inform decisions on soil management. In the meantime, the scientists hope soil gets more popular with policymakers, the public, and budding researchers. “There are new things to discover in the soil, right here on Earth. You don’t have to go to Mars or the moon to find something you don’t know,” says Nancy Johnson, a soil ecologist at Northern Arizona University one of the authors of the atlas. “My gosh. It’s right under our feet.” There are 40,000 known mite species and perhaps twice as many in existence.

That's only the case for the diversity of termites, as compared to other regions."
606,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/78400/15-shucking-amazing-facts-about-oysters,,"Oysters are slimy, yet delicious. Casanova purportedly ate 50 of them for breakfast daily—and he isn’t the only one who believed they had certain powers. Oysters are definitely key to healthy marine ecosystems and clean water. Here are 15 facts about these ugly yet amazing shellfish. Every day, one oyster filters 50 gallons of water and a healthy one-acre reef around 24 million gallons—enough to fill 36 Olympic swimming pools. Here’s how that works. An oyster draws water in over its gills using cilia, or tiny hairs. Plankton and particles in the water are trapped in mucus in the gill, then transported to the oyster’s mouth. So, yeah, oysters basically eat their own snot but, at the same time, remove excess sediment, nutrients, and algae from the water. That keeps the water in good shape for other marine life. A close-up image of a Gulf Coast oyster bed taken in 2007 for a federal ecosystem restoration initiative. Image credit: EPA viaWikipedia Commons//Public Domain Oysters form beds or reefs that provide important habitat for fish and other creatures, including sea anemones and barnacles, which in turn provide food for bigger fish such as striped bass, black drum, and croaker. That works out to 1.5 extra tons of seafood a year. Oystersspawnwhen water temperatures rise in spring. Females release millions of eggs and males even more sperm and some of these lucky gametes meet in the open water. Fertilized eggs develop into microscopic larvae, little more than tiny black specks, which feed on algae, drifting on currents and tides for three weeks. Then, if something else hasn’t eaten them, the larvae attach to a hard surface, most likely other oysters, and transform into a tiny oyster called a spat. In areas where reefs have declined, oyster larvae may never find a place to settle. Oyster reefs provide an effective natural barrier to storm waves and sea level rise. They absorb as much as 76 to 93 percent of wave energy, which reduces erosion, flooding, and property damage from coastal storms. Oyster reefs are preferable to manmade rip-rap or bulkheads, which don’t provide other benefits, such as habitat, and cost a lot to maintain. According to a Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortiumreport, 100 miles of oyster reefs could save up to $95 million on rip-rap or $150 million on bulkheads. Oysters are high in zinc, which is good for your immune system, and also provide calcium, vitamin C, omega 3 fatty acids, iron, and protein. Jason Hedlund, seafood coordinator for Whole Foods Markets, toldmental_flossthat oysters are low in cholesterol as well. “And that old rule about only eating oysters in months with an ‘R’ in them no longer applies, thanks to developments in food safety,” he added. Not an accurate representation of how pearls are found in oysters. Image credit: iStock Closely related to the food oysters (family Ostreidae) are the pearl oysters (family Aviculidae). When any small irritant such as a grain of sand gets inside an oyster shell, the animal covers it with nacre, or mother-of-pearl, the substance that forms the inside lining of the shell. Over several years, as more layers are added, apearl forms. The type, color and shape of a pearl depend on pigment in the nacre and the shape of the original irritant. Today, most pearls are cultured, or created in farmed oysters. Cultured pearls look just like natural ones but are considered less valuable. Oyster reefs are the single most imperiled marine habitat on Earth, with 85 to 90 percent of wild reefs lost. The main culprit is destructive fishing practices, including overharvesting, according to areportfrom The Nature Conservancy, along with habitat loss and declining water quality. Fortunately, oyster reef restoration efforts are very successful. Some 80 restoration projects are currently underway around the U.S., including Nature Conservancy projects in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.  Monitoring of these projects has shown as much as 212 percent increases in oyster growth and 850 percent increases in other marine life on the reefs. NOAA is involved in oyster reef restoration in Chesapeake Bay, where native populations had plunged to 1 percent of historic levels. A study in theJournal of Applied Ecologyreviewed literature on the increase in juvenile fish and mobile crustaceans inCrassostrea virginicareefs in the US and found increased production for 19 and 12 species, respectively, in the Gulf of Mexico and in the South and Mid-Atlantic. Marsh grass and oyster beds. Image credit: Steve Hillebrand, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, viaWikimedia Commons//Public Domain A variety of techniques work for oyster reef restoration, from shooting oyster shell from high-pressure hoses to placing bags of shells in the water. Some projects have built lines of shell and rock to stabilize the shoreline along with planting sea grass behind the reef to provide additional habitat. In areas without existing structure for ""spat set"" (a good location for young oysters, a.k.a. spat), seed oysters from hatcheries are used to establish new reefs. As the oceans absorb more carbon dioxide, it changes the chemistry of the water. The world’s oceans have become 30 percent more acidic since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and that can kill oyster larvae and make it harder for oysters to form shells. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood WatchratesEastern oysters from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Florida caught by dredge or tong as ""Best Choices."" The oyster harvest has no bycatch—other species of marine life caught along with the intended target.

Raw, grilled, fried, wrapped in bacon, mixed into dressing, in soup, casserole or stew—oysters can beeatenjust about any way you can think of. Whole Foods seafood coordinator Jason Hedlund calls them a hyper-local seafood, tellingmental_floss, “Oysters reflect the bay they come from, almost like a terroir.” Anyone with the right knife and gloves can shuck their own oysters. Watchthis videowith George Hastings, a national oyster shucking champion (yes, there is such a thing). Oyster production in the Gulf of Mexico declined each of the four years following the BP oil spill disaster. A report from the National Wildlife Federation,Five Years and Counting, states “…oyster eggs, sperm and larvae were exposed to oil and dispersants during the 2010 oil spill. [Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons] can be lethal to oyster gametes, embryos, larvae, juveniles and adults. They can also have sub-lethal effects, such as reduced reproductive success.” Unable to move away from such contamination, sedentary oysters are particularly susceptible. There is little, if any, truth to the idea that oysters are an aphrodisiac. They contain phosphorus and iodine, which may increase human stamina, and zinc aids in production of testosterone. American and Italian researchers found that a type of mussel related to oysters contains two rare amino acids: D-aspartic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate, which have been shown to increase sperm motility and stimulate testosterone in mice. But no studies have looked at whether that translates to increased libido. As one of the researchers,George Fisher, professor of chemistry at Barry University, toldmental_floss, “To my knowledge, the old-wives tale of eating oysters to improve libido has no sustainable, scientific proof.”"
607,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79915/germany-generating-record-breaking-amounts-renewable-energy,,"Sunday, May 8 was a good day for Germany’s renewable energy sources. AsQuartzreports, last Sunday Germany’s solar, wind, hydro, and biomass plants generated so much energy, power prices actually went negative. For a period of time, a full 87 percent of the country’s power was supplied by renewable sources, which meant that nuclear and coal plants ended up having to pay commercial customers to use energy. Conditions on Sunday, May 8 were apparently perfect for renewable energy production: The Sun was shining, and the wind was blowing all day. But even on cloudier, calmer days, Germany is still producing impressive amounts of renewable energy. Last year, the average renewable energy mix was 33 percent, and Germany hopes to reach 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. Germany currently has plans to open new wind power plants, pushing its renewable energy production up considerably. Though Sunday’s renewable energy output was an all-time high for Germany, it still hasn't surpassed its northern neighbor, Denmark. In general, Denmark is known for its high renewable energy output, and on an extremely windy day in 2015, its wind turbines generated a full 140 percent of the power consumed by the country (surplus power was redirected to Norway, Germany, and Sweden,International Business Timesreports). Still, Germany is making great strides in renewable energy production, setting a standard for countries around the world. “We have a greater share of renewable energy every year,” Christoph Podewils of the German clean energy think tank Agora Energiewende told Quartz. “The power system adapted to this quite nicely. This day shows again that a system with large amounts of renewable energy works fine.” [h/tQuartz]"

His data sheet summarizing the records are on the table. Image credit:  John J. Magnuson Climate change may seem like a fairly new topic for scientific investigation—going back a few decades, perhaps—but anew studypublished inNature Scientific Reportsshows that people have been tracking changes in climate for much longer than previously thought. The study, which examined records from far northern Europe and from Japan stretching back to the 17th and 15th centuries, respectively, found that those early records—like those collected more recently—point to the same troubling conclusion: The world has been getting warmer ever since the Industrial Revolution. In 1442, Shinto priests in the Japanese Alps started keeping track of the date on which a nearby lake froze. And in 1693, merchants in northern Finland began to track the date on which ice would break up on a local river. Taken together, these are the oldest inland water-and-ice records known. “These are direct observations of climate, and they’re very consistent with each other,” biologist Sapna Sharma of York University in Toronto tellsmental_floss. The data from both locations can be plotted as approximately straight lines, showing only a very slow change in the freeze-date in Japan (which moved gradually earlier), and in the melting date from Finland (which moved gradually later), until the 19th century—at which point “the slope of the line changes significantly,” indicating a rise in temperatures, Sharma says. The international team of researchers was led by Sharma and by John J. Magnuson, a limnologist (an expert on inland waters) at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The Japanese data wascollected by priests at Lake Suwaas part of a ceremony honoring two gods said to dwell on opposite sides of the lake. According to legend, the male god, Takeminakata, would cross the frozen waters to visit a female god, Yasakatome, at her shrine on the other side of the lake. In Finland, the freezing of Torne River was important to traders, merchants, and travelers. Record-keeping continued in both locations right up to the present, with few interruptions, Sharma says: “The Scandinavia data only has six missing years—when the Russians invaded Finland, and the record keeper had to flee.” In Japan, the upward trend in temperature begins in the 1810s, while in Finland it begins around 1867—reflecting the later start of industrial activity in far northern Europe. “We looked at climate records, and diaries that people had kept describing the climate, and it seems to be consistent with when things started to warm up in both of those regions,” Sharma says. In Japan, for more than 200 years, the freeze-date moved by only a tiny amount from year to year—less than one-fifth of a day per decade, on average. After the onset of industrialization, however, that rate climbs to 4.6 days per decade. The Finnish data show a comparable change. The data are consistent with other studies of long-term climate change based on theoretical models as well as “paleo” studies (what scientists have been able to infer from sediment, ice cores, and tree rings) and from modern record keeping of ocean and air temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, Sharma says. The findings “provide a nice source of confirmation for other lines of evidence,” Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, who was not involved with the study, tellsmental_floss. Attempts to model changes in Earth’s climate over time rely on extrapolations of modern data, so having these early records can help scientists refine their mathematical models, Mann says. This, in turn, can help us predict what may lie ahead. “The better we are able to reproduce documented past changes in climate, the more confidence we have in our projections of future, human-caused climate change using the same climate models,” he says."
610,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/77572/climate-change-may-be-coming-your-wine,,"The long fingers of climate change have begun to disrupt our lives in ways we may never have expected. In a recent paper published in the journalNature Climate Change, two scientists say we can expect a disruption in the world’s wine supply in the near future. Wine grapes are fussy little things, requiring just the right soil composition, sunlight, moisture, and temperature. When wine grapes don’t get what they want, wine quality suffers. Each factor on its own changes the grapes. For this study, ecologist Elizabeth Wolkovich and climate scientist Benjamin Cook wanted to get a big-picture view of how drought and temperature affect grape harvests and wine quality. They analyzed climate records from the 20th and 21st centuries, as well as earlier records of temperature, precipitation, and soil conditions. They also consulted more than 500 years of vineyard records from France and Switzerland. In general, the higher the temperature, the faster the grapes ripen and the earlier the harvest. Historically, this has been tied to seasonal droughts (especially in France and Switzerland). As the ground dries out, it heats up, pushing the temperatures high enough to ripen the grapes. Without the drought, there’d be no burst of heat, meaning no early harvest. The scientists found that this drought-temperature-harvest dynamic held true, but only until the 1980s, when global warming really started to turn up the heat. Over the 20th century, average temperatures in France rose by 2.7°F, and the mercury continues to climb. Sure, 2.7°F might not sound like much to you, but ask a fussy grape how it feels. ""Now, it's become so warm thanks to climate change, grape growers don't need drought to get these very warm temperatures,"" Cooksaidin a press statement. ""After 1980, the drought signal effectively disappears. That means there's been a fundamental shift in the large-scale climate under which other, local factors operate."" The researchers say the shift in dynamics is most pronounced in regions like Alsace, Champagne, Burgundy, and Languedoc; all are regions that grow Pinot Noirs, Chardonnays, and other relatively cool-weather varieties that are especially sensitive to changes in temperature. While more heat may seem like a good thing, the grapes can only take so much. The authors say that, for right now, the bump in temperature has actually been pretty good for the grapes. ""So far, a good year is a hot year,"" Wolkovich said in the press release. But there’s a limit to how much the grapes can take. ""If we keep pushing the heat up, vineyards can't maintain that forever."" This means that, in time, these regions will no longer be able to produce these types of wines. ""If people are willing to drink Italian varieties grown in France and Pinot Noir from Germany, maybe we can adapt,"" Wolkovich said. It's a big ""maybe,"" though, as it's unknown whether or not the grapes themselves will be able to adapt to these totally new environments."

The mountains of Tongariro National Park on the North Island of New Zealand served as the home of Sauron and foundry of the One Ring in Peter Jackson’sLord of the Ringsfilms, and there is little human development there. On the night I crossed through in 2011, a brief flurry had passed, there were no street lights in any direction, and the main road was but a tiny ribbon of black dividing two banks of snow. Enveloped in darkness, it really felt like the ""Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie."" Where I looked up, what I saw was the universe—a vision of space depicted only in film and imaged by Hubble. The sky was dark, but notdark. There were many colors; vivid patches of teal and navy so brazenly colorful that it took a moment to process exactly what I was seeing. The celestial continents of color were stars—billions of them—so far and so faint that they ceased being pixels on a black display and formed instead a mosaic of the cosmos. There is so much up there. All night skies are not created equal, and the reason for this is called ""light pollution."" It is the cumulative effect of every excessive spot of artificial lighting in an area. These photons zip from every direction and toward the sky, and, as a result, we live beneath solid domes of luminescent haze. This has consequences: It smothers starlight, harms scientific discovery, and disrupts natural habitats and ecosystems. Astronomers lament light pollution for the simple fact that we can't study what we can't see. Until every astronomer has his or her own personal Hubble, they are limited to their earthbound telescopes. Moreover, nonscientists are denied the chance to experience the cosmos in which we live. (For more on how light pollution affects astronomers,check out this PBS documentary.) Environmentalists note that where there is light, there is electricity being used. That needless lighting wastes natural resources and thus harms the environment is self-evident. There's a good chance you turn off the lights when you leave a room. This same logic applies on a macro scale. Why keep a fast food sign lit at midnight when it won't be open until 6 a.m.? Biologists and ecologists, meanwhile, assert that light pollution also harms the ecosystem. The International Dark Sky Association, a non-profit organization which advocates for sensible reform,describeshow tens of thousands of sea turtle hatchlings die annually due to artificial light. The turtles are born on the beach and know only how to find the sea by using the natural glow of the horizon. Now surrounded by artificial lighting, the infant animals lose their way and die soon thereafter. Migratory birds, meanwhile, use the moon and stars for navigation and hunting. Artificial lighting is like holding a magnet to their natural compass. Birds find themselves in well-lighted cities, and things don't end well. Nobody wants the world to fall into total darkness. We want light and need light. But it can be improved. Just as smog isn’t produced by any single car, but by thousands, the easiest change one can make involves inspecting one's own exterior lighting. What does it illuminate, and is it necessary? Specifically, in which direction is the light shining? Once you notice this, you’ll never be able to un-notice it: An alarming number of lamp posts and outdoor home lighting fixtures shine outward and upward, needlessly lighting surrounding trees and chimney tops rather than the sidewalks and yards where those lumens are actually needed. These lamps should be shielded or redirected or both. Do you have home security lighting?Some disputethat it's actually helping you. What is inarguable, however, is that said lighting need not shine every minute of the night. Motion sensors save not only electricity, but also light for when there's actually something to see. Lastly, consider educating your local government on the the problem of light pollution. This might sound like too much work already, but we're not talking about getting the Secretary of the Interior on the phone. Your local councilperson was voted into office to hear what constituents have to say. Bring up the issue! The Astronomical League's official magazine,Reflector, has published ahow-to guidefor getting a local lighting ordinance passed, and the International Dark Skies Association in conjunction with the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America has amodel lighting ordinancefor city planners and officials to use when rethinking lighting policies. Forward that material along. One need not even sell your local elected official on the wonders of starlight: Too much lighting means more glare, which can be a dangerous hazard fordrivers and pedestrians alike. After all, you shouldn’t have to walk into Mordor to appreciate the visceral wonder of the night sky."

News of the butterfly’s discovery was recently published in theJournal of Research on the Lepidoptera. The insect was identified by the study’s co-author, Andrew Warren, a butterfly expert at the University of Florida in Gainesville. In 2010, while perusing a collection of butterfly specimens at the Florida Museum of Natural History, Warren spotted a winged creature labeled as the Chryxus Arctic butterfly. However, its wing coloration was a little off, and its size and reproductive parts weren’t a match. Warren teamed up with a slew of other scientists from separate institutions to help him identify the butterfly. Eventually, a peer sequenced its DNA and discovered it was characteristic of a different species. Turns out, the Tanana Arctic has been mistaken for the Chryxus for years. Contrary to researchers' long-held belief, it was an entirely new species, not a variant of Chryxus. The Tanana Arctic lives in the spruce and aspen forest of central Alaska’s Tanana-Yukon River Basin. It likely arose as a hybrid of the Chryxus Arctic and the White-veined Arctic butterfly during the last Ice Age, between 28,000 and 14,000 years ago. The organism might yield new insights into the pace of Arctic climate change,The Washington Postpoints out. Butterflies are sensitive to temperature shifts, so if the cold-weather insect ever leaves its longtime home in the Tanana River valley, scientists will know something’s up. Researchers plan to sequence the Tanana Arctic’s genome to learn whether it has any special traits that helped it survive in its freezing home. As of now, studies are needed to conclude for sure that it’s a new species, but experts believe there's compelling evidence to support the theory. [h/tNational Geographic]"

In turn, this unnatural diet leads to stunted growth, changed behavior, and, ultimately, increased mortality rates,the BBC reports. Researchers from Uppsala University in Sweden collected fertilized European perch eggs and embryos from the Baltic Sea. They then exposed them to different concentrations of polystyrene plastic microparticles that were smaller than one-fifth of an inch, around the size of ones floating in the sea. When the eggs weren’t exposed to microplastics, 96 percent of them hatched. But when they were exposed to high concentrations of the plastics, the amount dropped to 81 percent. Meanwhile, the surviving fish that had been exposed to the plastic were reportedly “smaller, slower, and more stupid,” the study’s lead author, Oona Lönnstedt, told the BBC. The fish also didn’t fare well against predators as their olfactory responses were impaired. Within 24 hours, larger fish like pike had gobbled up all the fish that had been raised with high plastic concentrations. In comparison, half the fish from clean waters survived. Perhaps most strikingly, fish larvae that had access to the plastic particles preferred to eat them instead of zooplankton. “This is the first time an animal has been found to preferentially feed on plastic particles and is cause for concern,” Peter Eklöv, the study’s co-author,saidin a press statement. Researchers plan to research the perch in their natural setting, and study how exposure to other plastic contaminants affects development. “Now we know that polystyrene is harmful, but we also need to compare it to the other common polymers such as polyethylene and PVC,” LönnstedttoldPBS NewsHour. “If we can target the chemical that is most harmful, at least this could hopefully be phased out of production.” While President Obamasigned a banon plasticmicrobeadslast year, some13 million tonsof plastic reportedly flows into the sea each year, and experts say that amount will only increase. Meanwhile, according to PBS NewsHour, up to 236,000 metric tons of microplastics enter the oceans each year thanks to larger pieces of plastic breaking down into little pieces. [h/tBBC News]"

But images can only tell us so much. Soundscape ecologist Bernie Krause has been recording the noises of natural habitats for years, and, through thousands of recordings, he’s been able to hear climate change happening. “When I first began to record almost 50 years ago,” Krause says in the video above from Great Big Story, “I would put on a pair of earphones and go out into the field and sit and listen, because it made me feel good. It made me aware of the living world around me.” A musician at the time, Krause managed to sell his nature recordings to Warner Brothers as a record calledIn a Wild Sanctuary. Decades later, Krause has become one of the world’s foremost experts in the new discipline of soundscape ecology, which uses the sounds of wildlife to monitor the state of ecosystems. Audio input is incredibly important, he states in his bookThe Great Animal Orchestra: Finding the Origins of Music in the World’s Wild Places. “Our ear doesn’t lie,” Krausewrites. “I like to say to my students, ‘While a picture may be worth a thousand words, a soundscape is worth a thousand pictures.’” The pictures have not been pretty of late. Like a human heartbeat, a habitat’s soundscape is a good indicator of its health. But around the world, coral reefs, rainforests, and forests are in decline, and their soundscapes have flatlined.

618,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/80429/octopuses-cuttlefish-and-squid-are-thriving-warming-waters,,"You’ve heard that dark chocolate can be good for your health, but you’ve probably also heard that just a little piece can betoxicto your dog. What’s good for one species may be deadly for another, and vice versa. A new example: Researchers say that, unlike fish, populations of octopuses, squid, and cuttlefish have actually increased during the last six decades of climate change. The findings were published today in the journalCurrent Biology. The cephalopod (literally “head-footed”) family is one of the most remarkable on Earth. Octopuses,cuttlefish, and squid are squishy,strangeinvertebrates. As such, it was assumed for a long time that they were unintelligent automatons, completely at the mercy of instinct. We now know that nothing could be further from the truth. Theseastonishing animalshave gifts andskillsthat humans could only dream about. They also have a triad of traits—short lifespans, flexible development, and rapid growth—that allow them to adapt when other species are going belly-up. Even so, researchers did not expect to find them doingquitethis well. In fact, lead author and University of Adelaide biologist Zoë Doubleday was inspired to begin this project by reports of shrinking populations of giant Australian cuttlefish (pictured above). Doubleday and her colleagues reviewed fishing data on cephalopod catches from 1953 to 2013. Their dataset included information from all over the world about species found in both open water and on sea floors, and included targeted fishing species as well as bycatch. Their results suggest that, far from declining in rapidly warming waters, cephalopod populations are actually on the rise. “This is remarkable given the enormous life-history diversity exhibited across these groups,” the authors write, “which were represented in this study by 35 species/genera and six families.” The uniform increase across species, families, and regions suggests that global trends are at play. Earlier studies had suggested (and the authors of the current study believe) that warming waters might truncate cephalopods’ short life spans even further. And yes, a shorter life span is bad news for an individual, but cramming a lot of generations into a short period of time allows a species to adapt more quickly. The authors also speculate that, as fish populations shrink, cephalopods may finally be getting some relief from predators and rivals for resources. But let’s not throw an octopus parade just yet. This study focused on a small subset of cephalopod species, notes Mark Carnall of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Additionally, he wrote in an email to mental_floss, “even live cephalopods are hard to identify,” and data collection can vary between and even within countries. On top of that, “many species of cephalopod are only known from a handful of specimens, so data about their diversity is thin on the ground.” And some species, like the highly tradedchambered nautilus, are definitely in decline or locally extinct. Ecosystem dynamics are never simple. An increase in cephalopod populations, if it's happening, could feed, and thus increase, populations of cephalopod predators. Additionally, as fish stocks shrink, humans are turning more to fishing for octopus and squid. And warming waters are not the only product of climate change: Our oceans are also gradually acidifying, which may affect even these resilient “weeds of the sea.” Editor's Note: This post has been updated to reflect additional insight from an outside expert."

The event is aimed at raising awareness of seas protection and the conservation of coral reefs worldwide. Image credit: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images The longest-lasting recorded global bleaching event began in 2014 and continues to affect coral reefs worldwide. Few areas in the Southern Hemisphere escaped bleaching in the recently ended summer; surveys of the Great Barrier Reef suggest that more than90 percentof it has been affected by bleaching. As heat arrives in the Northern Hemisphere, scientists expect to see bleaching in the Caribbean, Atlantic and Pacific, including Hawaii. Scientists first recorded a mass coral bleaching, one which affects entire reef systems and not just a few individual corals, in 1979. Sixty recorded events occurred between 1979 and 1990. Global coral bleaching events are mass bleaching across all three tropical ocean basins—the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. The first global event took place from 1997 to 1998, with at least 15 percent of global reefs dying, and the second occurred in 2010. Number three, still happening today, looks on track to be the worst ever, affecting 38 percent of the world’s reefs. Here’s what you need to know about this worldwide disaster. A coral reef in the Red Sea near Obhor, north of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Image credit: Hassan Ammar/AFP/Getty Images Thousands of species of coral exist, and hundreds of those are hard orreef-building corals. These individual coral animals, called polyps, look sort of like miniature sea anemones—a soft, tubular body topped by a ring of tentacles. Each builds a hard, protective external skeleton of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) around its base. Thousands together make up a reef, with each polyp connected to the next by a thin layer of tissue. Reefs grow when polyps periodically lift off their base and secrete a new one, adding layers of calcium. Sexual and asexualreproductionalso increase the size of reefs by increasing the number of individual polyps. Reef growth varies from 2 centimeters (0.8 inches) or less per year for massive corals up to 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) per year for branching corals. That means it can take thousands of years for a sizable reef to form and from hundreds of thousands to millions of years for barrier reefs and atolls. Most reef-building corals grow best in water with temperatures between 23° and 29°C (73 to 84 F), high salinity (from 32 to 42 parts per thousand), and enough clarity to permit high light penetration. This generally restricts reefs to tropical or subtropical waters, (between 30° north and 30° south latitudes) and to the euphotic, or light-penetration, zone of the ocean, at most about 230 feet deep in the areas they call home. A school of manini fish passes over a coral reef in Honolulu's Hanauma Bay. Image credit: Donald Miralle/Getty Images Coral reefs function like oases in a desert, providing food and shelter for marine life. According to theGlobal Coral Bleachingconsortium, coral reefs represent 0.1 percent of the world’s ocean floor, but help support approximately 25 percent of all marine species. For example, reefs shelter juvenile fish until they grow large enough to venture into the open ocean. That 25 percent of marine life represents the livelihoods of 500 million people and an economic asset worth $1 trillion. NOAA estimates the commercial value of U.S. fisheries from coral reefs at more than $100 million annually. “Australia’s Coral Reefs: Under Threat from Climate Change,” areportfrom the Climate Council of Australia, notes that the Great Barrier Reef alone made a value-added economic contribution to the Australian economy of $5.7 billion in 2011–12, supporting 69,000 jobs. The Great Barrier Reef stretches more than 1400 miles and contains some 3000 individual reefs. Coral reefs also protect shorelines from storms and contribute to local economies through tourism. Coral reefs in the lagoon of the Toau atoll, about 250 miles from Tahiti in the Tuamotu Archipelago in the French Polynesia. Image credit: Gregory Boissy/AFP/Getty Images Most coral polyps are transparent; the color of a reef comes from symbiotic algae, or zooxanthellae, living within the tissues of the polyps. Coral and zooxanthellae have a mutually beneficial relationship, the coral providing the algae with a home and the algae providing coral with 80 percent of its nutritional requirements through photosynthesis (hence the need for sunlight). Corals experience stress when conditions move outside of normal ranges. Bleaching primarily results from temperature stress, when surrounding water temperatures are higher or lower than the coral organism’s optimum range. When stressed enough, corals expel their zooxanthellae, revealing the white calcium-carbonate skeleton and producing a “bleached” look. The animal is still alive at this point but only catching 20 percent of the food it needs. If the stress ends quickly enough, coral will accept algae back into its tissues and recover. If not, the coral will die. Its skeleton then becomes overgrown with other species of algae, which cover spaces where new coral polyps could land, preventing replenishment of live coral. This causes a shift from a coral-dominated to an algae-dominated reef, which has much less biodiversity. A turtle on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. According to an August 2014 Australian government report, the outlook for the Earth's largest living structure is ""poor,"" with climate change posing the most serious threat to the extensive coral reef ecosystem. The situation has only worsened since then. Image credit: William West/AFP/Getty Images Rising ocean temperatures due to climate change bear responsibility for mass coral bleaching events. Global average temperatures have risen for more than 50 years, with the 10 warmest years on record globally occurring since 1998. Ninety-three percent of climate change heat is absorbed by the ocean. Corals haven’t adapted to these higher base temperatures and cannot cope with the prolonged temperature peaks, and the increased amounts of carbon dioxide has caused the ocean to become much more acidic, which slows the growth of coral even more. Mark Eakin, coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’sCoral Reef Watch, tellsmental_floss, “The role of climate change in this event is huge. There is no way this event could be happening the way it is now if we weren’t seeing global warming.” The surface temperature of the oceans increased by 1°C (33°F) during the past 35 years. A 2012 paper inNaturewarned that a 2°C (35°F) rise in sea temperatures—an oft-stated goal set by the 2009 UN Climate ChangeConference—will cost us at least one-third of the world’s coral reefs. El Niño, a large-scale, ocean-atmosphere climate interaction in the tropical Pacific, creates unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific. It can significantly affect weather patterns and ocean conditions across large portions of the globe. Originally recognized by fishermen, the phenomenon was named El Niño as it tended to arrive around Christmas. Eakins points out that the 2015 El Nino weather pattern kicked in earlier than usual—March and April rather than June—and water temperatures were already so warm that it didn’t take long for bleaching conditions to occur. Jodie Rummer, a senior research fellow at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, who conducted aerial surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, blames the combination of El Niño, climate change, and an extended period of hot summer days with exceptionally low tides for bleaching of many corals there. In May, the Climate Council of Australiareportedthat 93 percent of individual reefs in the Great Barrier Reef have suffered some degree of bleaching, with northernmost reefs most severely affected. This is by far the worst event in the reef’s history, the organization states. Analysis indicates, on average, 50 percent mortality of bleached corals north of Port Douglas, with a final death toll likely to exceed 90 percent on some reefs. On U.S. reefs, record-breaking bleaching events have occurred in the Hawaiian Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Florida. Severe bleaching has been seen on reefs across the Pacific, Caribbean and Indian Oceans. At this point, an estimated 36 percent of coral reefs worldwide have been affected by major bleaching with nearly all reefs experiencing some thermal stress.

Image credit: Phil Walter/Getty Images Scientists at universities and government agencies around the world monitor coral reefs on a regular basis, conducting regular surveys from airplanes and boats. The NOAA’S Coral Reef Watch program collectssatellite dataon environmental conditions, including sea surface temperatures, to quickly identify areas at risk for coral bleaching. The program also collects reports of visual observations of the health of reefs. Scientists with the ARC Centre of Excellence forCoral Reef Studiesat Australia’s James Cook University, who conducted aerial surveys of the Great Barrier Reef followed by in-water observations, recognized the unusual extent and severity of this event early this year. When coral dies, fish and other animals that feed on or shelter in it die or move away. Larger creatures that feed on them also go away. This includes birds, and their loss can affect island plant ecosystems nourished by bird droppings. Decline of populations of fish and other sea life affect human food supplies as well as the fisheries and tourism industries. This will create economic hardship for people with livelihoods connected to those industries. Loss of healthy reefs will increase the threat from storm surge—even as climate change increases the severity of storms—and coastal erosion. University of Miami biologists Andrew Baker and Rivah Winter study staghorn coral in April 2016 as part of their research into how multiple climate stressors will impact coral reef in the future. Scientists around the world are studying how they can help coral survive the warming and acidification of the world's oceans. Image credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Healthy corals have a greater ability to recover from bleaching, so it helps to reduce other stressors, such as overfishing and pollution, including agricultural and urban run-off. Many scientists have called for action in these areas and are supporting work to make coral reefs more resilient. The Nature Conservancy, for example, offers resilienceworkshops and trainingto reef managers. Researchers also are usinggenetic analysisto identify coral species more tolerant to warming oceans and considering facilitating the spread of those species. Addressing climate change remains critical, though. The Climate Council of Australia report states “…the future of coral reefs depends on how much and how fast we reduce greenhouse gas emissions now, and in the coming years and decades. Global emissions must be trending downwards by 2020 at the latest.” A giant clam nestles among coral reefs in the Red Sea near Obhor, north of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Image credit: Hassan Ammar/AFP/Getty Images “Reducing your carbon footprint is absolutely number one,” Eakin says. He also points out that many coral stressors result from local actions, including overfishing and poor land use that allows soil and nutrients to wash into the ocean. If you directly interact with reefs by snorkeling or scuba diving, choose environmentally conscious operators who, for example, anchor away from reefs. Never touch coral (not even for that fantastic macro shot) and be careful your gear or fins don’t either. Avoid using sunscreen, as recent research shows it harms corals (wear protective clothing while diving and snorkeling instead). Become a citizen scientist and contribute to global coral data collection. Columbia University and The World Surfing League developed an app calledBleach Patrolthat allows anyone to report bleached or healthy reefs in real time, from anywhere in the world. “The Bleach Patrol dataset will help us understand the geographic extent and patterns of bleaching,” explains Eakin. “It tells us when and where corals are bleaching and when and where they are healthy.”"
620,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79610/5-backyard-and-balcony-habitats-you-can-build-attract-wildlife,,"Thoreau lamented a modern world of endless clearing, ""familiar and worn by us, appropriated and fenced in some way, and reclaimed from Nature."" Things haven't improved much in the century-and-a-half since his call for simplicity. We mow our lawns and manicure our gardens until every rose juts out just so. It's a wonderful thing to behold, but it may as well be made of plastic. Fortruewonder, short of living alone in the woods, there are ways to give a little bit back to nature, if only at the margins. Bringing bats, birds, and butterflies to your balcony or backyard requires surprisingly little effort. Here are five ways to practice backyard conservation. Bats might not come immediately to mind when you think of wildlife you'd like to welcome to your backyard, but consider this: in exchange for a house the size of a pizza box, a small brown bat can eat up to1000 mosquito-sized insectsina single night. For the environmental and financial savings in pesticides alone, a bat house (price:about $30) is a win for everyone involved. (Except mosquitoes. This deal works out very poorly for them.) There's not much work involved inhanging a bat house: ideally, mount it 10 feet from the ground facing south-southeast. (It should receive seven hours of direct sunlight per day.) If it is near a freshwater source, even better. Bats are good at finding new areas to roost. It takes somewhere between one and five years for them to move in, so don't be in a rush. Hang the box and just let it be. According toBat Conservation International, 60 percent of bat houses are occupied, which means that even if you do it wrong, bats can still figure out what to do. This one is for the truly devoted. Snakes are great for your garden. Snakes are poikilotherms, which means their internal temperatures are environment-dependent. If you see one just kind of lying around, it's notwaiting patiently to kill youwhen you least expect it. Rather, it's probably just trying to get some sun; it's how they stay alive. They are great for your garden because they move noiselessly, don't damage your plants, and can pretty much obliterate rodent families in a couple of weeks. (Grasshopper populations are similarly placed on notice.) You canbuild a snake habitatwith logs, sticks, and vines. The idea is to build a structure with lots of holes, nooks, and crannies. If you're really devoted to the cause you can even build a full fledgedsnake hibernaculum. A window bird feeder might be yourbest bet for attracting wildlifeif you live in a city. Both nectar and seed-based feeders will do the trick, and don't worry: there are more birds to be found in cities than pigeons. (Afeeder in New York City, for example, can attract everything from sparrows to bluebirds.) To increase your odds of bringing in the birds, plant colorful flowers in a box alongside your feeder, and use a universal feed such as black-oil sunflower seeds. If you have a balcony, even better:add a bird bathto really make an avian's day. Those with backyards can go far beyond the goal of simply attracting birds to your garden. By choosing various types of foliage, feeders, and birdhouses, you can attract specific breeds of bird. Consider the flowers you can plant: To bring in hummingbirds, plant red and yellow tubular flowers (or just buy a hummingbird feeder). Because daisies produce nutritious seeds, a daisy garden can attractsparrows, finches, and cardinals. Sunflowers are good forchickadees, goldfinches, and blue jays. Meanwhile, different bird feeders and bird houses are designed to attract different types of birds. (An eagle can't nest in a birdhouse with one-inch holes.) Tray feeders near the ground can bring ground-feeding birds. Small perches on tube feeders can attract, say, grosbeaks while deterring grackles. There'sa lot of flexibility here, and the result is a birdwatcher's dream. Fresh water is also a must to keep the birds happy and healthy, and consequently, to keep them coming back. For best results, consider a birdbath with moving water, anddon't forget to clean it regularly. A clean birdbath minimizes disease risks for the bird, reduces algae, and eliminates mosquitoes. Nectar-producing plants are like butterfly magnets, and just as in the case of birds, different types of flowers attract different types of butterflies.Azaleas, coneflowers, and lantanaare butterfly-friendly nectar plants. Add a few other types of plants and you can support theentire butterfly lifecycle. Caterpillars can find nourishment in hollyhocks, dill, milkweeds, and aspen trees, among many other plants. Butterflies lay their eggs on or under the leaves of such plants. When a caterpillar emerges, its eats the plant before going off and forming a chrysalis. Butterflies emerge, and the process repeats itself. It's beautiful, good for the insects, and good for you.

Statoil, an energy company based in Norway, has just received the seabed lease they need to construct the largest floating wind farm in the world.

622,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/78423/paris-converting-its-roundabouts-pedestrian-spaces,,"Paris has announced plans to make its public spaces a little bit greener. The city will be converting seven of its roundabouts into pedestrian spaces where Parisians and tourists can come to relax. Since many of the city’s largest intersections happen to circle historic landmarks, transforming traffic-congested car lanes into green spaces will also create better access to monuments and tourist attractions. Fast Company'sCo.Existreports that Paris has been toying with the idea for some time. In 2013, the city transformed thePlace de la Républiqueinto a tree-lined pedestrian plaza, which quickly became a popular destination. The seven additional roundabout redesign projects, which include the Place de la Bastille, Place de la Madeleine, and Place du Pantheon, amongothers, are something of an extension of that initial project. Paris isn’t rushing into the redesign project blindly, though. The French Transportation Users Association wants to ensure that these spaces become more pedestrian friendly without significantly inconveniencing drivers.

Their goal? To eliminate trash before it’s created, according toThe New York Times. The ""pre-cycling"" trend seems to be spreading across Europe:According to Food Tank, a similarly designed store calledLØS Marketwill open in Copenhagen, Denmark this summer. LØS Market plans to sell 400 organic products from locally sourced farmers and vendors. Customers won’t be taking these foods home in a plastic shopping bag. Instead, they will place them in their own containers brought from home, and use free empty bottles provided by the store for liquids like wine, oil, and soap. When shoppers are done with the bottles, they can be returned for washing at LØS Market and given to new visitors. For dry goods, patrons will be given compostable paper bags. As Scandinavia’s first zero-packaging supermarket, LØS Market’s aim is to reduce the some 343.9 pounds of packaging waste produced per person each year in the European Union, Food Tank explains. Since Americans generatedabout 251 million tons of trashin 2012 and recycled and composted only 87 million tons of it, we can definitely learn some lessons in pre-cycling from across the pond.

624,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73483/roofs-covered-plastic-grass-could-harness-wind-energy,,"One group of scientists is trying to harness wind energy by mimicking the motions of a field of grass rippling in the breeze—except their grass is made of plastic and their field is on a roof. According to the findings publishing in the journalAdvanced Materials, a joint team of Chinese and American researchers created an experimental turboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Here's how it works: The team adhered plastic strips to a board in a way that makes them stand upright in rows. One side of each strip is coated with nanowires and the other side with indium tin oxide (ITO). When the “grass” is pushed by the wind, the nanowires brush against the ITO sides of the surrounding strips, allowing electrons to pass from one piece to the next. This generates a current via thetriboelectric effect. This method of generating wind power could be practical in many situations. In addition to harnessing power from steady gusts, the technology would be able to effectively work with choppy winds blowing in any direction and would be ideal for spots where windmills would be impractical. The experimental TENG—which so far has only been tested in a lab by using an electric fan and 60 strips of plastic on a model rooftop—generated enough energy to light 60 LEDs. The system was also functional in wind speeds as low as 13 mph and was most effective in close to 62-mph winds—a speed too high to be practical, asone researcher notedtoNew Scientist. While the project is still far from ready to be used out in the real world, a 985-square-foot rooftop carpeted with the strips would generate 7.11 kilowatts, enough energy to mostly power a home, according to the researchers. For now, the team is focused on figuring out a way to efficiently store the energy that’s generated. They will also need to find a substitute for indium tin oxide because it's both toxic and expensive. [h/t:New Scientist]"
625,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72432/11-diseases-and-pests-are-catastrophic-plants,,"Plant life is subject to the harms of an enormous range of diseases, pests, and other ills—some relatively harmless, and others capable of withering entire crops and destroying whole forests, too. Here are just a handful of the pests that make protecting plants such a tough job. U.S. Forest Service Native to Europe and Asia, the gypsy moth was accidentally introduced to U.S. terrain in the late 1860s byE. Leopold Trouvelot. The French astronomer, artist, and amateur entomologist, who lived near Boston, was cultivating moths gathered in France when some specimens escaped. Twenty years later, outbreaks of the pest began cropping up in the region, and it’s been spreading its North American domain ever since. Larval gypsy moths damage trees by gobbling down their leaves and needles; the process of refoliation depletes the trees' energy stores, leaving them more susceptible to other pests and diseases. As a U.S. Forest Service Report explains [PDF], flightless adult female moths build protected egg masses containing up to 1000 eggs on the surface of trees, which can keep eggs cozy through low and even into freezing temperatures until it's time to hatch. Then, the larvae either stick around or ""balloon"" to a more suitable host tree by dangling in the wind on silk-like thread. For up to 12 weeks, the developing caterpillars will consume a tree's needles or leaves at a devastating rate. Just a couple of generations of gypsy moths can keep a host tree from ever properly re-growing its foliage, often killing it. Gypsy moths pose a threat to hundreds of species of plants, but oak and aspen trees are the moths' most common hosts—particularly in the Northern lake states and the Appalachian and Ozark mountains. The U.S. Forest Service has alsodescribedthe gypsy moth as “one of North America's most devastating forest pests,” but researchers still don't know what long-term effects the moths might have on forest vegetation. Also called ""head scab"" [PDF], fusarium head blight disease (FHB) has been causing North American wheat, barley, and other grass crops to become blighted seemingly overnight for almost a century; the blight caused losses ofover $3 billion to U.S. wheat and barley farmersbetween 1990 and 2003.The grain-bearing spikelets of plants infected withFusarium graminearum, the most common and destructive of severalFusariumspecies that affect crops, will often exhibit “premature bleaching” and shriveling—a pretty clear signal to farmers that FHB has struck and produced the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (a.k.a. vomitoxin), which, according to a study inInterdisciplinary Toxicology, “affects animal and human health causing acute temporary nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and fever.” FHB has been managed pretty well in many regions using fungicides,prediction algorithmsthat allow farmers to pre-treat crops that are likely to become affected, and the planting of resistant crop strains. But as of the ‘90s, the fungus has been gaining traction again in previously controlled areas:Outbreakshave been reported in the eastern and midwestern United States and in eastern and central Canada, too. Wikimedia Commons//CC BY-SA 3.0 This fungus attacks the tassels, nodal shoots, stalks, leaf mid-ribs, and seeds (or kernels) of corn plants with localized infections—it doesn't take over the whole host plant—and converts plant tissues into tumor-like growths ofup to a foot in diameter.Once mature, these thick-walled growths open to release the fungus's powdery spores, which can then infect nearby plants. In Mexico, the blight is known ashuitlacoche. It's harvested and used as an ingredient in various dishes, but mostly, corn smut causes major headaches for farmers around the world by rendering crops unusable. The U.S. Rice Producers Association reports [PDF] that rice, a staple crop for about half the world's peoples, is responsible for producing about a quarter of all human energy on the planet, and takes up close to 11 percent of the world's arable lands with its cultivation. Rice blast—which, according toPlantwise, is ""currently the most important disease of rice worldwide""—can wipe out rice nurseries and crops, with losses from neck blast alone reaching 70 percent in some fields. The disease exhibits a host of symptoms throughout rice plants, including lesions, rot, stunting, and plant death. Resistant and semi-resistant rice strains have helped protect against this threat, but variability among the disease's different pathogens continues to make rice blast hard to combat for farmers and researchers alike. According to theCalifornia Environmental Protection Agency, high temperature and humidity levels in Asia and the southeast U.S. are to blame for the frequency of rice blast in those regions. Wikimedia Commons// Public Domain Desert locustsare similar to other short-horned grasshoppers in the superfamily Acridoidea, but have some key differences: These animals, which have been causing periodic plagues for thousands of years, will often change their behavior and form massive swarms of adults and juveniles that can migrate over long distances, leaving destruction in their wake. The UN's Food and Agriculture Organizationnotesthat, seeing as an adult locust can eat about 2 grams—or just about its own body weight—each day, a square-kilometer swarm of 40 million locusts can consume the same amount of food in one day as about 35,000 people. First discovered on U.S. shores 20 years ago in California, sudden oak death is a disease that has, according to University of California scientists David M. Rizzo and Matteo Garbelotto, reached epidemic proportions, having been found in nearly all woody plant species in mixed evergreen and redwood forests from central California to southern Oregon [PDF]. Researchers arestill workingto pin down a lot about this fungus-like pathogen (including its origin); however, we do know that infected plants don't always die, and that some instead live on as breeding grounds for a disease that causes oozing above-ground cankers, spreads its spores through splashing and running rainwater, and has wiped out tens of thousands of trees to date. Michael McCullough,Flickr//CC BY-NC 2.0 Despite its prevalence, sudden oak death hasn't even approached the level of destruction caused by pine beetles. The bugs, which are found all along the west coast of North America, have already infested 32 million acres of lodgepole pine forest in British Columbia alone—about the size of 24 million football fields, or the whole state of Alabama—releasing ""an estimated 270 tons of carbon [and] converting the forest from a carbon sink to a large net carbon source,"" according to theBBC. This native species has always had itspopulation booms, but researchers credit climate changes as well as our attempts to minimize forest fires, an important factor in healthy forest ecosystems, for the bark-burrowing beetle'scatastrophic risein recent decades. There are around 15,000 species of nematodes, roundworms that are found pretty much everywhere on Earth and account for about 14 percent of all plant loss worldwide, or almost $100 billion annually, according to theAmerican Phytopathological Society. Root-knot nematodes are especially destructive to crops, causing galls and other abnormal growth in plants' root areas. The hundred or so Meloidogyne species of nematodes cause varying degrees of damage to plants depending on climate, plant species, and local soil conditions, but the galls caused by widespread species likeM. incognita, which make roots unable to properly absorb nutrients and moisture, can lead to whole fields of wilted, un-sellable crops. Forms of rust, including those that cause stem, black, and cereal rusts in grain crops, pose a major threat to wheat production worldwide,have caused severe epidemics in African wheat crops, and have been spreading through the continent and into Asia and the Middle East over the past several years, according toAdvances in Agronomy.The Los Angeles Timesreported in 2009 that the stem rust fungus known as Ug99 could destroy upwards of 80 percent of the world's wheat crops in the near future as it spreads by air and human carriers from Africa. Oregon State University professor Jim Peterson described the fungus to theTimesas a ""time bomb"" that's already started counting down: ""It moves in the air, it can move in clothing on an airplane. We know it's going to be here,"" he said. ""It's a matter of how long it's going to take."" According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service [PDF], the aphid-like hemlock wooly adelgid (HWA) has infested almost half of native-range hemlock trees in the eastern U.S., has been found in areas reaching from southeastern Maine to northeastern Georgia and over to eastern Tennessee, too, and is spreading into new hemlock populations at a rate of almost eight miles per year. Infested nursery stock have also brought the pest to Ohio, Vermont, and Michigan, where quarantines and eradication efforts have been launched to help keep HWA populations from growing.  HWA does its damage by inserting its ""long, piercing-sucking mouth parts"" into the base of hemlock trees' needles, the U.S. Department of Agriculture explains [PDF], and feeding on nutrients stored in the needles' xylem ray cells, leading to needle discoloration and loss, desiccation, and branch dieback. Recent research also suggests that this process causes a hypersensitive response in the tree, which can create ""false growth rings"" around infested tissue that restrict the tree's ability to transport water inside itself. Depending on moisture availability in an area and other local stress factors, HWA can be fatal within 4 to 15 years to hemlocks of all ages (sometimes even causing a mortality rate of 95 percent). As a ""foundation species,"" hemlock trees help to define the structure of a forest and regulate its ecosystem dynamics, and the health of about 2.3 million acres of U.S. forest is tied closely to that of hemlock populations that mostly dominate them. It's understandable, then, that the USDA's Forest Service calls HWA ""the single greatest threat to the health and sustainability of hemlock as a forest resource in the eastern United States [with] impacts comparable to those of the gypsy moth, Dutch elm disease, and chestnut blight [and] the potential to remove a major ecological component from eastern forests that is important for maintaining clean water and supporting wildlife."" Wikimedia Commons// Public Domain USDAAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Serviceexperts suspect that this pest first traveled from its native regions of Japan, China, and Korea (where it's similarly destroyed whole forests) to the U.S., Europe, and other areas in solid wood packing materials. The bugs first showed up in the U.S. on several Brooklyn, New York hardwood trees in 1996, according to Cornell University'sNew York Invasive Species Information(NYIS) project, before cropping up in Chicago in 1998 and in several New Jersey counties through the early 2000s. Their reach has extended even further in the years since, bringing them to the states of Massachusetts and Ohio, among others. According to the NYIS, ""millions of acres of hardwoods could be killed [by the beetles], potentially causing more damage than the combined impact of Dutch elm disease, chestnut blight, and gypsy moths."" Asian longhorned beetles are especially deadly to maple, birch, elm, and other hardwood trees because of the big bugs' consumption-heavy life cycle: As theJournal of Integrated Pest Managementexplains, adult females (which are up to 1.5 inches long) bore holes through trees' outer bark and into the softer cambium layer underneath. These craters not only protect an individual egg from being crushed, they're also a nutrient-rich place for the beetles to pass their larval and pupal stages. Unfortunately for the trees, these craters are hard to seal back up again. Options for fighting the infestation are mostly limited to the removal of infected trees and the quarantining of potential ones, and some towns and cities have reported their eradication of the beetles in the past few years. At present, however, Asian longhorned beetles still threaten up to 61 percent of urban trees in the U.S., with a potential economic loss of around $669 billion, according to theJournal of Integrated Pest Management."

She is leucistic, meaning she was born with a genetic condition that prevents some of her skin cells from making pigment. According to researchers, Omo is the only known white-hued giraffe currently in existence. This rare distinction makes her vulnerable to poachers, and in need of protection by giraffe conservators. According toThe Telegraph, Omo was first sighted nearly a year agoduring a population survey. (A local lodge guide named her Omo after a popular brand of powdered laundry detergent sold in Africa.) Recently, ecologist Derek Lee, who founded wilderness research and preservation groupWild Nature Institute, photographed a matured Omo in her natural habitat. Rare white giraffe spotted in Tanzania could be 'target' for poachershttps://t.co/pizrIh3xMRpic.twitter.com/Z8d4ZR8Bhz Now 15 months old, Omo will likely survive into adulthood. She’s no longer a small calf, which means she's better equipped to defend herself against predators like leopards, hyenas, and lions. She's not out of the woods yet, however. Omo is facing a different predator these days: humans. Giraffes are regularly killed for their meat, and Lee believes Omo could be targeted for her coat. “We and our partners are working on giraffe conservation and anti-poaching to help give Omo and her relatives a better chance of survival,” Lee said. “We hope that she lives a long life and that someday she has calves of her own.” While Omo’s coat might make her vulnerable to poachers, it doesn’t keep her from fitting in with other giraffes. According to Lee, she is always spotted with a group of peers, and they appear to get along as normal. “They don’t seem to mind her different coloring,” he said."

According to research published in the journalEnvironmental Science & Technology,environmental scientists from the UK’s University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Laboratory found that zooplankton have no issues gobbling up microbeads, those pieces of plastic smaller than one millimeter that are often included in exfoliating face wash and other hygiene products (and recentlybannedin the U.S.). Then, they poop out the pieces of plastic, leaving them for coprophagous biota (a.k.a. poop-eating creatures) to gobble up. Observing capturedzooplanktonin the lab, the experimenters found that two species of small crustaceans, called copepods, were more than willing to ingest pieces of plastic introduced to their environment. And when they did, it changed their feces. The plastic-laced poop was lighter than typical plankton poop, floating to the bottom of the glass beakers more slowly. Since plankton and their waste products are such an important food source for other ocean dwellers, the researchers suggest that these slow-floating, plastic-laced feces could be spreading plastic to different layers of the ocean as other animals consume them. If the microbead-filled feces drift to the bottom of the ocean more slowly than regular poop, there’s more time for animals to eat them and swim away, later depositing the same plastic somewhere else through their own waste. This study was done in the lab and the microbeads were introduced to the water. However, considering howmuch plasticthere is in the ocean, it’s not a stretch to assume similar conditions might play out in the wild."

It sure does. New audio recordings from the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world's oceans, have captured the sounds of whales, distant earthquakes, storms, and even ships passing tens of thousands of feet above. Challenger Deep is a valley inside the trench, seven miles below the surface of the ocean. To give you some idea of just how deep that is: If you chiseled Mount Everest off its foundation and dropped it into the Challenger Deep, the mountain’s peak would still be a mile underwater. Image credit: Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping - Joint Hydrographic Center The valley is of great scientific interest, but its distance from the surface and the tremendous amounts of pressure down there have made it hard to study. A team of engineers created a special titanium-coatedhydrophone, or underwater microphone, but even they weren’t sure it would work. ""We had never put a hydrophone deeper than a mile or so below the surface, so putting an instrument down some seven miles into the ocean was daunting,"" engineer Haru Matsumotosaidin a press release. ""We had to drop the hydrophone mooring down through the water column at no more than about five meters per second. Structures don't like rapid change, and we were afraid we would crack the ceramic housing outside the hydrophone."" Researchers dropped the hydrophone over the side of a ship. More than six hours passed before the equipment reached the valley floor, but once it did, it began recording. When the research team collected the hydrophone, they brought up 23 days' worth of noise from the bottom. ""You would think that the deepest part of the ocean would be one of the quietest places on Earth,"" chief project scientist Robert Dziak said in the press release. ""Yet there really is almost constant noise from both natural and man-made sources. The ambient sound field at Challenger Deep is dominated by the sound of earthquakes, both near and far was well as the distinct moans of baleen whales and the overwhelming clamor of a category 4 typhoon that just happened to pass overhead. There was also a lot of noise from ship traffic, identifiable by the clear sound pattern the ship propellers make when they pass by."" Curious what those “distinct moans” and that “overwhelming clamor” sound like? Listen for yourself: The Challenger Deep soundtrack is impressive on its own, as both scientific data and a demonstration of human ingenuity. But it’s also an indicator that our effects on the environment reach farther than we could have imagined. Scientists now know that anthropogenic (human-created) sound wreaks havoc on marine ecosystems, from the largestwhalesto the smallestfish eggson coral reefs.

Buying or selling a domestic bird isa felony—putting a damper on the use of birds in movies. Writer Nicholas Lund expounds: Instead of using a familiar American bird like a blue jay or a blackbird, filmmakers have to make do with a similar-looking bird that isn’t native to the States, sourcing avian actors from exotic bird breeders. While this may feel restrictive to a director’s vision, the law has been instrumental in protecting American bird species.

An expedition led by the University of Oxford’s Conservation Research Unit recently discovered a hidden group of the big cats in a remote region of northwest Ethiopia,according toNew Scientist. With the help of traps set up to capture the animals on camera, conservationists were able to confirm anecdotal reports of the lions. The pride lives in the savannahs of Alatash National Park—which lies near Ethiopia’s border with Sudan. And their existence is a significant discovery for researchers. According to those involved, the find suggests that the vulnerable species might be more plentiful than they had previously thought. “During my professional career I have had to revise the lion distribution map many times,” says Hans Bauer, who led the expedition. “I have deleted one population after the other.

She started creating as soon as she was old enough to hold a paintbrush; now, several decades later, Gass has fulfilled her childhood dream and then some. The Bay Area artist creates vibrant works of art on cloth, but they’re not just pretty pictures. Each of Gass’sstitched paintings, as she calls them, also serves as a stark illustration of the damage we’re causing our planet. Gass grew up in the 1970s, along with the first stirrings of modern environmentalism. By the time she reached college, the movement was in full swing. It was a “lifestyle,” she tellsmental_floss. “It really opened my eyes.” But there were practical concerns to attend to. Gass’s parents wanted her to find a career that would support her, which made becoming an artist out of the question. She turned instead to math and computer science, eventually entering the software industry. And her parents were right: she was well-supported. But she wasn’t satisfied. So after years of saving up, she quit. “It was a really tough decision,” she says. “I had worked all my life to get to the point where I was in the software industry and it certainly paid well. All of my friends were there. So I had to really build up my courage to step away.” The risky decision paid off. By 1998, Gass had found her way into textile art, and she never looked back. “I love working in textiles,” she says. “There’s something about fabric that’s very comforting. It’s beautiful and a pleasure to work with.” But her environmental roots were calling. It wasn’t long before Gass realized she could integrate her concerns into her art. Her first ecological piece,After the Gold Rush,was inspired by an aerial photograph of California’s Interstate 5. After the Gold Rush Painting after painting followed, addressing themes of land use, water pollution, and human violence against the landscape. Yet each image is luminous and lovely to see.

Severely Burned Refined? San Joaquin Merced Revival Over the last two decades, Gass has expanded her repertoire to include sculpture and landscape installations. Last year, she was honored with a creative ecology residency in East Palo Alto, California. She chose to work on Cooley Landing, a public beach that had, until recently, been landfill. Understandably, the community was somewhat hesitant to spend time there. But through Gass’s free workshops, locals of all ages were able to discover the natural beauty and heritage of their new shoreline. East Palo Alto is something of an economic island, a low-income city in a sea of wealthy neighbors. The ecology residency had a dual purpose: introducing the city's residents to their new open space, and offering them an opportunity to engage in hands-on art and science. Gass and her workshop participants sketched the wildlife they saw and created a huge installation along the coast—thousands of bright-blue flags, marking where the waterline had once been. Gass also used her students’ drawings to create a blank silk canvas for community members to paint. “I overheard some of the girls while they were painting with the dyes, saying, ‘This is magical!’ Which is exactly how I felt about silk painting the very first time I tried it,"" she says. ""It is this very magical, mesmerizing technique. It was so great to be reminded of how lucky I am to be able to work in this art form.” Gass shows her work in galleries and museums around the country.

A few years ago, the sisters learned that plastic bags were contributing to pollution and waste problems in Bali, clogging up waterways and covering the island’s famous beaches in trash, so they decided to start an environmental organization calledBye Bye Plastic Bags. Since then, the sisters have cleaned up beaches, started petitions, and organized awareness-raising events. Recently, they achieved their greatest victory yet: They convinced the governor of Bali, I Made Mangku Pastika, to ban plastic bags by 2018. According toOne Green Planet, Bali has long attracted tourists with its pristine beaches and clear waters, but in recent years, plastic waste and litter have started to mar the once-idyllic island. When the then-10-year-old Isabel and 13-year-old Melati learned about Bali’s trash problem in 2013, they were initially overwhelmed. “In Bali, we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day,”said Isabelin a recent TED Talk. “That’s about a 14-story building. And when it comes to plastic bags, less than five percent gets recycled.” The sisters decided that, rather than target all of Bali’s trash and recycling problems, they would focus on eliminating plastic bags. Since then, Bye Bye Plastic Bags has made significant strides to reduce plastic bag waste in Bali, and the sisters have spoken to more than 5000 students around the world about the importance of developing waste-management strategies. Their goal is both to reduce plastic bag waste in Bali and to show kids around the world that they can have a real impact on policy-making. “Don’t ever let anyone tell you that you’re too young or you won’t understand,” said Isabel in her TED Talk. “We’re not telling you it’s going to be easy. We’re telling you it’s going to be worth it.” Check out Melati and Isabel’s TED Talk below. [h/tOne Green Planet]"

The discovery could be used to develop new ways to tackle the earth's growing plastic waste problem. Some plastics can take between450 and 1000 yearsto decompose, but items made with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) stick around for much longer. PET plastic never biodegrades, which is what makes the discovery of this new bacteria, dubbedIdeonella sakaiensis, so remarkable. According to the study recently published inScience, it took the organisms six weeks to break down a thumbnail-sized sliver of PET at 30° C in lab tests. To degrade the material,I. sakaiensislatches on with its thread-like appendages. It uses just two enzymes to break down the PET into its environmentally-friendly chemical components, which it then makes into a meal. Researchers stumbled upon the bacteria while studying the microbes living on discarded PET products the researchers had salvaged. The team believes the bacteria consumes PET alone, and the fact that these plastics have been around for less than 80 years suggests they evolved this adaptation relatively recently. Over5 trillion pieces of plastic, weighing a total of 269,000 tons, are estimated to be clogging up our planet's oceans. The scientists are hoping their discovery could inspire new ways of dealing with plastic pollution, possibly through the use of genetic engineering. While six weeks is a long time to spend chowing down on one piece of plastic, transferringI.sakaiensis's enzyme-producing genes toE. colibacteria might help to speed up the process.

While that might not sound like a big deal—glasses, after all, are no longer considered a fashion faux pas—the study also predicts an increase in severe myopia, which can lead to blindness. According toEurekAlert!, a sevenfold increase in nearsightedness is predicted from 2000 to 2050, and up to one in 10 people around the globe may eventually be at risk for blindness. Scientists aren’t sure what is causing such extreme increases in nearsightedness, though they believe environmental factors are likely the culprit. “Environmental factors (nurture), principally lifestyle changes resulting from a combination of decreased time outdoors and increased near work activities, among other factors,"" are to blame, say the study’s authors. Scientists are working on pinpointing the exact causes of, and possible cures for, myopia. So far, they know that light plays an important role in eye development, and that by depriving developing eyes of light, they can induce myopia in animals.WIREDexplains that scientists have induced nearsightedness in young monkeys, chickens, and tree shrews by covering one of their eyes during infancy. They also found that they could reduce induced myopia in chickens by exposing them to bright light later on. Unfortunately, exposure to bright light doesn’t reverse myopia in all cases, and the technique hasn't been tested on human subjects. In general, it’s difficult for scientists to pinpoint the exact causes of human myopia, and therefore its cure, since human testing usually isn’t possible. But studies have found a general link between spending time outdoors as a kid and reduced risk of myopia.

But a closer look reveals something magical: thousands of the orange and black butterflies clustering together in the tall trees for warmth and protection. Pismo is one of about200 siteswhere western monarchs overwinter along the California coast. A three-day drive up the iconic Pacific Coast Highway from Santa Barbara to the Monterey Peninsula offers the chance to see some of the greatest concentrations of overwintering monarchs in the United States. These are not the eastern monarchs that migrate by the millions to the mountains of central Mexico. Western monarchs, which today number less than 1 million, originate west of the Rockies. Unable to survive freezing northern winters, they travel hundreds or thousands of miles to mild coastal microclimates.They roostin Monterey cypress and pine and non-native eucalyptus, which provide protection from wind, rainstorms, and predators. The butterflies that make the journey to these coastal groves are very special. While the lifespan of spring and summer monarchs is 10 weeks or less, this generation born in early fall has adapted to survive between six and nine months—long enough to make the great migration and overwinter on the coast. As they migrate, these monarchs suck up as much flower nectar as they can to build fat reserves that will sustain them on their journey. They’ll need it, too, because they travel up to 100 miles a day and fly as high as 10,000 feet. This generation spends months in a state of reproductive diapause, when a hormone necessary to trigger development of their reproductive organs isabsent or nearly absentuntil conditions are favorable for offspring. Those conditions become favorable right around now, when days become longer and warmer and monarch mating season gets underway. The butterflies will be gone by March at the latest, so don't wait too long to see them. So grab your binoculars and get ready for a classic California road trip with an amazing twist. Bonus: all of these butterfly groves have free entry. Jim Ellwanger,Flickr//CC BY-NC 2.0 Monarchs aren’t able to fly until the temperature rises above 57°F, so early afternoon is the best time to witness the butterflies bursting from their clusters and flying around theGoleta Butterfly Grove.

Development, agriculture, and climate change are destroying monarch habitat and the milkweed plant that isessential to the species’ survival. The caterpillars only eat milkweed, and the butterflies lay their eggs on the plant.

642,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76018/oregano-significantly-curbs-amount-methane-cow-burps,,"Anyone who has spent time at a dairy or stockyard knows that cows are gassy creatures. And all that gas takes a toll on the environment: Cows emit enormous amounts of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to climate change. But you might be surprised to learn that the majority of methane emitted by cows comes from their mouths, not their rears. Cattle are responsible for about two-thirds of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, according to areportby the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. That works out to nearly 10 percent of global emissions overall. As a greenhouse gas, methane is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, because it'smuch better at trapping radiation. The problem is so serious that governments around the world are looking for new ways to cut cattle methane production. Now a team of researchers in Denmark is testing the potential of oregano—that’s right, the herb you shake on your pizza—to do the job. Scientists from Aarhus University have just launched a four-year study to gauge the effectiveness of a particularly potent type of Greek oregano in reducing methane emissions from dairy cow belches by adding it to the cows’ feed. Cows, like sheep, goats, buffalo, and camels, are ruminants, a type of animal with a unique digestive system that includes a large stomach chamber called the rumen. There, microbes break down food through fermentation, helping cows to survive on tough plant material that other animals cannot eat. But some of those microbes produce methane—a lot of it—that the cows belch out before it can work its way through the rest of their digestive systems. “The contribution of methane gases from ruminants to global warming is considerable, and a reduction in methane emission from ruminants would be of great importance—not only for organic agriculture but worldwide,” project manager Kai Grevsen said in an email tomental_floss. Grevsen is a senior researcher in theAarhus University Department of Food Science. Conventional farmers already use nitrates, antibiotics, fats, and starches to reduce the methane released when cows pass gas. But nitrates and certain fats aren’t permitted under European Union and Danish organic rules. In recent years, scientists have also experimented with a number of other chemical methane inhibitors, but concerns about animal health, food safety, and the environmental impact have stymied commercial use. Earlier researchled by Penn State scientists suggested that oregano could cut cows’ methane emissions up to 40 percent. But the type of oregano used in those experiments wasn’t as strong as the current project’s organic Greek oregano, which has higher concentrations of essential oils and antimicrobial properties. “The theory is that the essential oil in oregano … is killing or, at least, weakening the population of the methane-producing microbes more than all the other ‘good’ microbes, and therefore less methane is produced,” Grevsen says. Most of the earlier experiments were also performedin vitro, in a lab. The Danish experiment will place cows from three organic dairy farms in specially designed, airtight chambers where researchers can monitor the cows’ digestion, take samples of the microbes, and measure all the gases they emit. The cows’ milk will also be tested for quality and taste. Part of the challenge will be to determine the right amount of oregano to control the methane-producing microbes without causing adverse effects to the cows’ normal digestion, Grevsen says. Oregano isn’t the only promising effort to control cows’ methane production. There’s a growing body of research looking into solutions that range from new types of feed to experimental vaccines to genetic modification that would breed less gassy cows. But the oregano supplement, if successful, might be one of the most straightforward, environmentally friendly solutions yet. “The Greek oregano is relatively simple to grow,” Grevsen says. “It’s a perennial 4–5 year crop that has high biomass yield and can be harvested like hay.” If the Danish research shows positive results, it could be good news for the United States, which has set a goal of cutting methane emissions from dairy cows25 percent by 2020. There’s also evidence that oregano may be associated with increased milk production and quality. Stay tuned to find out whether “oregano-fed cows” becomes the next big food trend."

Each blade would extend 650 feet, which is more than two and half times the length of any wind blade currently in existence. In order to keep a structure of that scale stable in extreme weather situations, Sandia plans to employ some clever design tricks borrowed from nature. The ""exascale"" turbine will be supported by a lightweight, segmented pole that yields to high winds to keep it from snapping in two. The blades themselves will be segmented as well so they can collapse safely when battered by hurricane-force gusts.

On a calm day, the entirety of the turbine’s 1300-foot blade span would be extended to generate the maximum amount of wind energy.

645,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/77270/unusual-fairy-circles-found-outside-africa-first-time,,"Strange, circular bald spots called ""fairy circles"" have been found in Australia, which marks the first time the phenomenon has been seen outside of Africa. Researchers say soil and plants created the circles themselves, and the theory of these origins has been published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Fairy circles are open spots of naked earth in areas otherwise covered with vegetation. When they appear, they appear in droves, and they’re typically pretty big; the circles in Namibia range from7 to almost 50 feetin diameter apiece. From the air, they look like leopard spots on the landscape. (Their unusual appearance may even triggertrypophobiain some observers.) Where do fairy circles come from? That depends on whom you ask. Two culprits are most commonly suggested: bugs and gas. The bug theorists say the spots are areas where the tiny bites of ants and termites have killed the grass. As evidence, they point to the fact that Africa’s fairy circles are indeed all located by termite and ant colonies. Other scientists say the spots are the product of lots of carbon monoxide leaks. The gas rises out of the Earth’s crust, they say, killing all the vegetation it touches. But study author and fairy circle expert Stephan Getzin of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research doesn’t buy either of these theories. He’s a believer in the self-organizing plants theory, which says that, under certain conditions, plants gravitate toward resources. “Water is limited, and because water is limited it cannot sustain a continuous vegetation coverage,” hetoldSmithsonian. “So we have gaps and other patterns like labyrinths and stripes or even spots.” The self-organizing theory met with resistance for a long time. Some scientists said it wasn’t even possible. If such a thing could happen, they argued, why weren’t there fairy circles in places other than Africa? In 2014, shortly after publishing a paper on Namibia’s circles, Getzin got an email and a photo from Bronwyn Bell, an environmental manager for a mining company. Bell had read Getzin’s paper and was sure she had seen something similar nearby. Getzin was astonished. “We couldn’t believe it,” he said. “The Namibia fairy circles are supposed to be the only ones in the world.” Getzin assembled a team of colleagues and headed to Australia. They took soil samples, recorded detailed measurements, and snapped photos from the ground and in the air. They ran computer simulations and image analysis, looking all the while for some pattern or evidence. Image Credit: Stephan Getzin They found that the Australian fairy circles were identical in appearance to their Namibian counterparts, but there were some interesting differences. For one, there were almost no ants or termites to be found. Cryptic sand termites, the prime Namibian termite suspects, don’t even exist in Australia, Getzinsaidin a press statement. “And the [insects] we did find have a completely different distribution pattern to the fairy circles."" So much for the bug theory. Getzin and his colleagues found that the Australian soil literally forced the plants out. In Western Australia’s intense sunlight, any earth not covered with vegetation is more or less cooked, and a hard crust forms on top. The baked earth is so hard, rain can’t get in—and no rain means no plants. It's a self-perpetuating cycle that Getzin says could explain the spots. Smithsonianexplains further: ""In Namibia, the sandy soils of the fairy circles are much more permeable and precipitation can drain away with ease,"" Getzin said. ""The details of this mechanism are different to that in Australia, but it produces the same vegetation pattern because both systems of gaps are triggered by the same instability."" His theory bolstered, Getzin intends next to begin a worldwide search for other fairy circles. [h/tSmithsonian]"

Over thenext 12 years, the import of chemical additives was restricted and their sale in the state forbidden, leading to the gradual organic certification of 75,000 hectares of agricultural land. The harmful effects of pesticides and fertilizers has been an issue facing India for decades. Following the Green Revolution of the mid-20th century, India’s food production increased which led to a higher prevalence of modified seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides in farming. The chemicals were hazardous to the environment, as well as a threat to the health of citizens. Several years ago, over 150 people in south India were struck by a condition related to head swelling and brain damage caused by a deadly pesticide calledendosulfan, which led to its nationwide ban in 2011.

But this exotic aquatic creature—an invasive and voracious predator—has been the scourge of the western Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico for most of the past decade, asAl Jazeera Americareports. In the 1980s, erstwhile aquarium ownersreportedly dumped their lionfish—which are native to the Pacific and Indian oceans—into the Atlantic. Around 2007, the population started increasing at a precipitous rate. Scientists don’t know exactly why this happened. However, they do know that the lionfish has no known predators. They're resistant to disease and infection. And female lionfish canlay up to 2 million eggs per year. Lionfish also aren’t as ethereal as they appear. They are vicious predators, consuming more than 50 species of fish, some of which are two-thirds of the lionfish's own body size (about a foot long). They gobble up juvenile grouper, snapper, flounder, and other ""table fish,"" which are important for Florida’s economy. And since lionfish areusually immune to baits or traps, divers generally have to kill them with spears one at a time. Spearing lionfish is a tricky business—they have18 venomous spinesthat can inflict seriously painful injuries, and the fish don’t fear humans. They can also survive in waters too deep for recreational divers to reach. While enterprising individuals areinventing new potential trapsand hostinglionfish hunting derbies, there’s still no easy way to diminish the invasion. As a landlubber, what can you do to help lessen the lionfish harm?Order it in restaurants. It’s white, flaky, and reportedly tastes like a cross between a grouper and a hog snapper. Hopefully, culinary demand for the lionfish will help control the exploding population, and help reclaim the waters. [h/tAl Jazeera America]"

In her video, Bionerd23 measures the radiation levels of a kindergarten in what was once the village of Kopachi, filming herself wandering around with a Geiger counter. In the years since her first Chernobyl video aired,Bionerd23has become a minor YouTube sensation. Thousands of people watch her do little more than wander around radioactive sites taking measurements. In 2014, sheappearedin anepisodeof Discovery Channel’s YouTube-focused showOutrageous Acts of Science(calledYou Have Been Warnedin some parts of the world). Her most-viewedvideo from Chernobylgarnered more than 442,000 views: In it, she tosses bread from somewhere off-camera to a large catfish in a Chernobyl cooling pond, explaining that the fish are large because they have no predators and plenty of food from curious tourists, not because they’remutated from radiation. After anAtlas Obscurainterview in April ofthis yeardescribed her videos as “strange” and “dangerous,”mental_flossgot in contact with the vlogger to find out more about the story behind her unusual travel/science series—and to figure out just how dangerous “stunts” like eating apples from the Exclusion Zone really are. Bionerd23, who steadfastly maintains her anonymity and avoids mentioning her age or exact location, is a physics student at a university in Germany. She became obsessed with nuclear physics before she even got to college, driven by her natural skepticism. “I was highly suspicious at school—whether it was physics or religion, I’d be like ‘prove it or I don't believe you’ towards my teachers,” she tellsmental_flossin an email. With equipment like homemade Geiger counters, “you can PROVE the existence of the atom as nuclear physics describes it—in your own home.” Her first videos include footage of her playing with mercury, even holding it in her hand, and traveling to the German state of Saxony to measure the radioactivity of abandoned uranium mines. Her first visit to Chernobyl was part of a small Dutch television project that involved comparing the radiation levels in Brazil and in the Exclusion Zone. She put some of her personal footage from the trip on YouTube, beginning her role as an online chronicler of Chernobyl adventures. “I try to post the videos that would get ME excited about physics if I was a teenager, or an adult working in a different field,” she says. Most of the footage she films herself, or she’ll hand the camera over to someone she’s traveling with, including tourists and scientists. She’s currently collaborating with American videographerLucas Brunelle, who’s best known for cycling films and stunts. Trailer - Lucas goes to Chernobyl 2 - featuring bionerd23fromLucas BrunelleonVimeo. On a typical trip, Bionerd23 will stay in Chernobyl around a week, exploring areas like a former radio factory, a hospital, and the power plant itself. She’s found odd things such as a flask of human prostate cancer cells, and encountered horses, moose, and even wolves in the evacuated region, which has becomesomething of a nature preservesince most of the humans left 30 years ago. She describes the Exclusion Zone as “a time capsule full of infinite wonders.” Where Bionerd23's videos diverge from those of typical urban explorers is that she finds science lessons in the ruins. “People don't understand the exponential function” of radiation risk, she explains. “They don't understand how the radiation levels 30 years ago were deadly, killing people directly exposed in the vicinity of the reactor—and how they can be rather harmless levels nowadays.” Her videos also compare the radiation levels of different parts of Chernobyl with a broader context. When she measures the radiation of Exclusion Zone apples, for instance, she also measures the higher radiation levels of German-foraged mushrooms. Eating apples off a tree near the Chernobyl plant may seem more dangerous than it is, according to Ron Chesser, a professor of biological sciences who studies radiation dispersion and nuclear accidents at Texas Tech University. “The typical day-long excursion through the Chernobyl Zone will convey about half of a chest x-ray even if you eat a bushel of apples along the way,” he tellsmental_flossin an email. However, years of living in the Zone and eating things that live there can pose a real risk, he continues. “Some dietary products (mushrooms, boar, some fishes) may have much higher radioactivity levels than apples,” he explains. “Obviously, a steady diet of zone products and constant presence in some portions of the zone could incur some real risks to inhabitants after years of living in contaminated areas.” Though the Exclusion Zone has been officially evacuated for 29 years, there are still a few people eking out a life there, however dangerous long-term radiation exposure may be. More than a hundred people, mostly elderly women, have returned to the zone to live in the now-contaminated communities surrounding the plant. (A recent film,Babushkas of Chernobyl, tells their story.) The Babushkas of Chernobyl - TrailerfromHolly MorrisonVimeo.

652,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71650/what-ever-happened-all-those-subway-cars-we-dumped-atlantic,,"Most of what humans put in the oceans is pretty rotten, from the tons of plastic floating in the world’s gyres—which can end up in thefish we eat—to untreated sewage dumped every time it rains. But drowning decommissioned NYC subway cars in the Atlantic Ocean throughout the 2000s? Well, it was—maybe—beneficial. The idea goes like this: By stripping the cars, cleaning them, and then tossing them off barges into the waters off the shores of New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, we could create fish habitats along the sandy-bottomed coastal shelf that runs from New York to Cape Hatteras. Most of that shelf is devoid of rock outcrops around which fish communities typically form; after corals and plants attach to them, oysters, mussels, and other invertebrates usually follow, which in turn attract fish. Here the subway cars take the place of rock as a rich environment full of nooks and crannies where an ocean community can grow. ""Oftentimes [artificial reefs] are hundreds of times richer in terms of biomass than the natural community at the bottom,"" Jeff Tinsman, the artificial reef coordinator for the Delaware Department of Natural Resources,toldNational Geographicback in 2006. ""This is very attractive to fish."" And according to studies on artificial vs. natural reef systems, both seem to harborsimilar numbersanddiversity of animals. As you can see in the video below (skip to 4:12 to get to the subway-car reefs), there are fish galore in what looks like an IRT carriage-shaped reef. Simon Thorrold, a scientist in the biology department at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, toldmental_floss, “There is no doubt that if you put subway cars into areas with little hard structure, they will attract invertebrates, and then they will attract fish.” But it’s hard to know whether that additional habitat is increasing fish populations or just moving them around, “The question is: Are you increasing productivity? Or just aggregating fish that are [already] there?"" Thorrold says. ""If it's the latter, you just make the fish easier to catch. Which is not necessarily bad, but you can't claim that the reef is adding fish."" So while fishermen and divers may love these sites (and they certainly look fun to explore), they may not be fostering higher numbers of fish or other animals. And the cars are breaking down faster than originally thought—certainly faster than bedrock where natural reefs tend to form. “It's good for fishermen and it's good for divers. Whether it's good for the ocean is up in air,” Thorrold says. For now, it appears that we’ve finally dumped something into the oceans that doesn’t seem to be hurting them."
653,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/69466/maryland-built-worlds-largest-man-made-oyster-reef,,"It’s been a rough past few decades for the Chesapeake Bay. Over the years, rampant over-fishing and noxious diseases have threatened the estuary's oysters. The shellfish aren't just tasty seafood; they're also vital for keeping the bay's waters clear. According to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a single adult oysterfilters and cleansup to 50 gallons of water per day. However, oysters caught in the bay have dropped from some 15 million in the 1800s to about 900,000 in recent years, theWashington Postreports. So in an ambitious plan to restore the estuary's bivalve mollusk population, the state of Maryland recently completed the world’s largest man-made oyster reef. The reef, which stretches for 330 acres across the bottom of a tidal creek on the state’s Eastern Shore, contains more than one billion oysters—and no fishing is allowed there. Organizations that lent a hand on the project include the Army Corps, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Nature Conservancy, among other participants. However, the reef really gained its, ahem, sea legs thanks to scientists at theHorn Point Laboratoryin Cambridge, Md. Run by the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science, the lab created new baby oysters, or “spat,” by coaxing parents into mating. Once the spat formed, they were placed into tanks and spoon-fed algae. Eventually, spat need to attach on to a solid surface, like oyster shells, so they can settle and grow their own hard casing. One problem: Horn Point’s hatchery was producing billions of spat, and there weren’t enough oyster shells in the Chesapeake Bay area to go around. The Oyster Recovery Partnership of Maryland had to import oyster shells from Louisiana and collect them from restaurants across the mid-Atlantic before shipping them back to Cambridge. The project began five years ago, and the last remaining oyster spat were recently deposited into Harris Creek,theStar-Democratreports. There, the fledgling organisms will grow into adults, filter nitrogen from the water, re-populate other neighboring reefs, and hopefully help save the Bay. In following years, Maryland and Virginia will continue to restore the native oyster bottom of other Bay tributaries. Their efforts might serve as a model for similar endeavors, likeNew York City's Billion Oyster Project—a campaign that's planning on releasing one billion of the mollusks into New York Harbor over the next two decades. In any case, if you're a marine conservationist, it looks like the upcoming years are shaping up to be your oyster. [h/tWashington Post]"
654,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71899/seabird-poop-carries-ocean-pollution-ashore,,"You could call it karma: The garbage we dump into the oceans is literally coming home to roost. Ecologists have determined that nearly all seabirds ingest large quantities of plastic. As the birds return to shore and start pooping, the toxic chemicals from our trash begin to make their way back into coastal environments. Seabirds are having a rough go of it at the moment. A recent study found thata full 90 percentof them are ingesting plastic garbage, and that number is only rising. “That was shocking,” study author Chris WilcoxtoldNational Geographic. “Essentially, the number of species and number of individuals within species that you find plastic in is going up fairly rapidly by a couple percent every year.” This is awful for the birds, and it’s not so great for the rest of us, either: Every animal has a role to play in its local ecosystem, and every element of that system is connected. Ecologist Mark Mallory studies the effects of environmental stressors on Canadian coastlines. He’s especially interested in the niche occupied by Arctic seabirds like the northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis). The wordfulmarcomes from the Old Norse for “foul gull”—gull because that’s what they look like, and foul, because frightened fulmars vomit up a brightly colored,nasty-smelling oil. It’s fascinating (if gross) stuff, but Mallory is more interested in their poop. Fulmars make their homes on coastal cliffs. They build their nests, raise their young, and generally poop all over the place. Historically, this has been a very good thing; the feces acts as a fertilizer, delivering nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus to the seaside soil. “You get relatively lush conditions. It’s like an oasis,”Mallory toldSmithsonian. But these days the fulmar fertilizer has some added ingredients: DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, and other contaminants. Most of the plastics and chemicals filling our oceans aren’t poured into the ocean on purpose; they’re the result of industrial and agricultural runoff and poor waste management practices. Still, regardless of how they get there, they’re doing a lot of damage. Not only do the chemicals cling to pieces of seaborne plastic, but they also contaminate the food chain. It starts at the bottom. Plankton and other microscopic ocean organisms absorb the chemicals. Those organisms are eaten by larger organisms, which are eaten by larger organisms, and so on up the food chain, all the way to fulmars. And with every step, the chemicals accumulate and concentrate, getting more and more toxic. Then the fulmars bring their bellies full of chemicals back home, and relieve themselves all over the cliffs. Some of this waste is washed into freshwater pools, some of it seeps into the soil, and some of it is eaten. Fulmar guano is a prime nutrient source for algae and moss, but also for insects. Then those insects are eaten by adorable little birds called snow buntings. The snow buntings and fulmars are eaten, too, and the contaminants go around and around, in a toxic circle of life. Other scientists have confirmed Mallory’s findings in other coastal species. Veronica Padula, who studies seabirds at the University of Alaska, believes the chemicals may also be getting into the birds’ eggs, which are then eaten by foxes, eagles, and other predators—including humans. “It’s actually quite scary, especially when you start looking at what these chemicals do,”Padula toldSmithsonian. “You kind of want to find a bunker and hide.”"

That’s good news for U-Haul, a company with 70 years invested in offering a fleet of vehicles to transport everything from furniture to cat stowaways. (More on that later.) If helping entire households transplant themselves sounds like a mammoth undertaking, it is: The family-owned and operated company has seen its share of growing pains over the years. Check out some facts on corporate fistfights, a CEO fond of tossing money out the window, and which of their moving supplies are safe to eat. MyUHaulStory When Leonard ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife wanted to move from Los Angeles to Portland in 1945, they found that no one was willing to rent them a one-way trailer. Shoen, who had just been discharged from the Navy, saw aneedto enable families in a post-World War II economy to relocate on their own. He began U-Haul that same year, with the companycomparingthe trucks to the covered wagons of the early frontier. Customers couldrentthe trailers for $2 per day—a small price to enable what Leonard's son Joe would latercalla “better life.” Originally, Shoen had painted his trailers black. That proved to be a problem when he made a turn at a four-way intersection and got hit by an oncoming vehicle because—according to the other driver—he couldn’t see Shoen. The U-Haul owner immediately set aboutcopyingthe bright orange design he had seen on highway barricades so his fleet would be visible to other drivers on the road. The distinctive paint job also made the vehicles double as portable billboards for the company. MyUHaulStory Before U-Haul was able to establish a footprint in every major city across America, their strategy was to entice local business owners to become “agents” for the company by dropping off rented trailers at motor vehicle service stations. Customers would drive to their destination, find a station, and leave the trailer (trucks weren’tintroduceduntil 1959) along with apacket of informationabout becoming an official dealer. Though it risked losing their haulers to disreputable owners, the tactic paid off: By 1954, the company had over 1000 locations. The oil crisis of the 1970sclosedmany service stations, a fixture of the company’s business. Opening self-contained rental facilities enabled U-Haul to stamp their familiar orange brand across a variety of rentals: RVs, jet skis, lawn mowers, paint sprayers, and even party supplies were among their offerings in the 1980s. The most dramatic off-message business: VHS tapes. U-Haul opened seven locations in Michigan in 1985 that rented movies [PDF]. (It operated under the name Haullywood Video Rentals.) Customers could also make use of afree VCR rentalthat was customized with the familiar orange chassis. Lack of inventory and competition from the thousands of video stores that popped up that decadesuffocatedtheir business, though, and the company soon returned to their core hauling services. Shoen’s 12 sons and daughters often had disparate ideas for the direction of the company. In 1979, the founder made son Sam Shoen CEO, leading Sam’s brothers, Joe and Mark, to quit. Hostilities boiled over to the point that,according to Bloomberg, Leonard once accused the duo of being involved in a plot to murder Sam’s wife, Eva, in 1990. (She was shot and killed during an attempted robbery.) Mark filed a defamation suit that was thrown out of court due to his status as a public figure.According to the Associated Press, a man named Frank Marquis confessed to the murder during his 1994 trial. His arrest grew out of a tip that came in after a segment on the crimeairedonUnsolved Mysteries. The Shoens’ familial strife came to a head in 1989, when many company principals were in attendance for a shareholders' meeting in Reno, Nevada.Accordingto theLos Angeles Times, Mark Shoen got into a verbal altercation with brothers Sam and Michael. Tempers grew so heated that Michael was “pummeled” by Mark and Joe. The senior Shoen, who had been forced into retirement during the power scuffle in 1986,observedof his business that he had “created a monster.” IStock Though the company seemed relatively calm under his watch, Leonard Shoen was far from being a demure chairman. To demonstrate the ease with which a corporation could waste money, Shoen arranged for a visual by appearing in front of employees during a meeting in 1970 andtossing$1000 out of the window. Anyone who found the action objectionable was forced to watch it anyway: Shoen had placed an armed guard at the door. Besieged by complaints of turnovers and vehicular accidents owing to improper loading precautions on their trailers, U-Haul took the unusual step of refusing to rent trailers to anyone intending to attach one to a Ford Explorer beginning in 2003.Accordingto a 2007Los Angeles Timesfeature, the company’s reasoning was that Explorer SUVs were frequently the target of safety litigation, inviting greater potential for U-Haul to become involved in a lawsuit. (Defective tires on 1998 Explorer modelsresultedin several fatalities.) When news media, includingThe Los Angeles Times,reportedon a series of turnover accidents involving U-Haul fleet vehicles in 2007, current CEO Edward “Joe” Shoen didn’t hide behind a corporate-speak press release: He appeared onInside Editiontoexplainthat the accidents were likely due to improper loading. If any customer had questions about the vehicles or the company, he said, they could phone him directly. He kept his promise: Shoen hasansweredthe phone on Mother’s Day, at home, and at 5:45 a.m. Most days he’ll get between three and 10 calls. “Sometimes, though, someone may post something angry on the Internet with my phone number, and then I’ll get 100 calls in one day,” he said in 2013.

The cat, Kevin, was an orange tabby. While litters of kittens are adorable discoveries, monster reptiles are significantly less charming.

Velvety balls of the green algae are revered as national treasures, celebrated in religious ceremonies, and even kept as pets. A. linnaeiis a woolly algae that grows in lakes all over the Northern Hemisphere. In most regions the algae forms dense mats on the lake bed. In a few special places it grows into colonies of huggable emerald-green orbs. The movement of a lake’s waves gently turns the algae balls as they grow, ensuring that every inch is exposed to sunlight. Image credit:Alice, Wikimedia Commons // CC-BY-ND 2.0 In Japanese, the lake balls are calledmarimo(literally “bouncy ball plant”); in Ainu, the language spoken by the native people of Japan on the island of Hokkaido [PDF], they’retorasampe(“marsh monster”). In Icelandic, they’re known askúluskítur, or “round s**t,” after thecomplaints of fishermenwho have snared a ball in their nets. Despite these epithets, the people of Japan and Iceland adore their lake balls. Hokkaido’s Lake Akan has been declared a national park in order to safeguard the lake's marimo colony. The marimo themselves arebigger than basketballsand hundreds of years old. More than 500,000 visitors each year make a special trip to the marimo observation center located on an island in the middle of the lake just to watch the marimo grow. (They grow very slowly—about 5 mm a year—so this can't be an action-packed event.) Because it’s Japan, the lake ball craze has spawned a weird regional mascot. Hokkaido’s cartoon representative is Marimokkori, an anthropomorphic marimo with his very own algal erection. Yes,for real. The mascot’s name is a portmanteau of marimo andmokkori, a slang term for an erection. Other celebrations of the marimo are more reverent. Members of Hokkaido’s native Ainu community have staged a marimo festival every year since 1950. The festival grew out of concern for the then-polluted lake and its marimo, which were being removed from the lake and kept as pets. The community held a nationalMarimo Amnesty Daythat resulted in the recovery of 48 lake balls. An Ainu priest blessed the marimo before returning them to the lake. Now every year a number of marimo are taken from the water, cleaned, blessed, and carried through the streets.

Mining operations in the 1960s released phosphorus and nitrogen—two of bacteria's favorite foods—into the lake. Existing colonies of bacteria exploded into massive blooms, clouding the water and blocking sunlight from reaching the marimo on the bottom of the lake. Mining at the lake ended in 2004, but by then it was too late. By 2013, Lake Mývatn had lost its marimo. The loss may not be permanent; some scientists believe the damage can be reversed, and have begun devising plans to return the lake to its former chemical balance. These days, you don’t have to travel to meet marimo. Aquarists have embraced smaller versions of the fuzzy algae balls as décor and oxygen sources for their fish tanks.

Founded by the Pacific Rivers Council,Salmon-Safeis a Portland, Oregon-based organization that protects wild salmon in the West Coast watershed by monitoring land management practices. The independent nonprofit lets landowners and businesses go through a certification program to prove they’re using sustainable methods that don’t threaten the state’s marine life. So far, Nike’sworld headquarters,Portland State University, and various hop farms and vineyards have all received Salmon-Safe certifications. Now,Hopworks Urban Breweryin Portland has become thefirst brewery in the nationto earn the label. Hopworks had to prove that it treats storm and wastewater that passes through its factory and grounds, ensuring that only clean water returns to local tributaries. (That includes wastewater produced by the brewery itself.) It also adopted Salmon-Safe-approved materials, like low-flow faucets, retention ponds, and pervious concrete. At first glance, one doesn’t necessarily equate beer-brewing with salmon, but beer brewingisa water-intensive process: On average, breweries use about four liters of fresh water for every liter of beer—and environmentalistswant that waterto stay fresh for the fish. “Brewers are intensive users of resources, especially water … so it’s important for us to understand what it means to use those things and then do something about it,” Christian Ettinger, Hopworks’ founder,toldHakai Magazine. As more brewers become more mindful of this fact, Ettinger hopes that eco-conscious beer-making methods will be adopted by facilities across the country. Breweries have been using Salmon-Safe hops for several years now—but though Hopworks uses Salmon-Safe ingredients and has Salmon-Safe facilities, it's still working on tracking down Salmon-Safe malted barley. Yes, this means that the beer itself isn’t Salmon-Safe. That’s one more hurdle for Hopworks to jump—and for the region’s wild Pacific salmon to swim across. [h/tSmithsonian]"

They’re fashioned from the pliable, strong roots ofFicus elastica,a unique species of Indian rubber tree. The tree’s roots can be coaxed into growing across the water, and are manipulated into overpasses by the War Khasi and War Jaintia people of Meghalaya state. Some of the bridges are over 500 years old, and stretch up to 150 feet long. However, nobody knows who first made the bridges, where they come from, or how many there are. Meanwhile, the root bridges are buried deep in the jungle—meaning that many people have never seen or heard of them. Patrick Rogers of the Living Root Bridge Project wants to change this. He’s launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund an endeavor to locate, measure, and document the region’s root bridges, ladders, and observation platforms. He plans to log his findings into a blog or database, which he hopes will encourage awareness and preservation of the unique structures. That way, locals can benefit from the tourism they bring while also maintaining a centuries-old tradition amid threats of modernization. Rogers plans to take multiple trips to northern India over the next few years, and will use the donations to cover on-the-ground expenses.To learn more about his quest to keep India's root bridges alive and growing,visit the Living Root Bridge Project's homepageorcheck out his blog.

660,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/68820/6-audacious-efforts-save-endangered-rhinos,,"It’sWorld Rhino Day, a day to celebrate what little time we have left with dwindling numbers of rhinoceroses. Most rhinoceros species arecritically endangered, and some subspecies that were plentiful in the 1900s, such as thewestern black rhino, have already gone extinct from hunting, poaching, and habitat encroachment by farms. Illegal poaching—largely in pursuit of the rhinoceros horns that can fetch$30,000 a poundon the black market—kills a rhino every eight hours in South Africa alone, according to2014 estimates. The northern white rhino subspecies, for one, is down to four individuals, all consideredgeriatricby rhino standards. As rhino numbers dwindle, conservation efforts have had to get more creative. Here are six proposals that might help save the rhinoceros. As part of a system called the Real-time Anti-Poaching Intelligence Device (RAPID), a group of British researchers suggest outfitting endangered rhinoswith hidden camerasembedded in their horns. In combination with a heart rate monitor and GPS, the system would alert authorities if a rhino was felled by a poacher. Rangers could then helicopter into the exact location of the kill, and hopefully prosecute the poachers with the aid of the footage from the horn camera. Rhino poaching is at a record high right now in South Africa, where 393 of the animals were killed in just thefirst four monthsof 2015. Poachers target rhinos for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine (despite being the equivalent of giant nose-fingernails). One bioengineering startup, Pembient, argues that instead of merely trying to quash black market demand for horns, they could create synthetic versions. Pembient claims it can make a synthetic rhino horn that is genetically the same as the real deal. It’s being used as an ingredient in a skin care line, and one Beijing brewery is using it to make rhino horn beer. When certain subspecies of rhinoceros are so critically endangered that only a few individuals are left, rhino romance takes on a whole new  level of import. For Harapan, a Sumatran rhino born at the Cincinnati Zoo, there wereno eligible mates in his hemisphere. When Harapan’s sister died without producing any offspring, the Cincinnati Zoo decided to send America’s last Sumatran rhino to a breeding facility in Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra. Hopefully there he’ll be able to find a lady love (or two!) and make beautiful rhino babies. In Kenya, the last male northern white rhino is protected around the clock by aseries of armed guards. Sudan is the last male of his species who might be capable of breeding and, at 42, is getting on in years. But his caretakers at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy still hope he might be able to produce offspring with his two female companions, who also sport radio transmitters and security details to protect them from horn hunters. The only other male northern white rhino died last year, and the subspecies is believed to only exist in captivity, making it understandable that Sudan has a security detail that rivals the U.S. president’s. As part of an effort to stop elephant and rhino poaching, theLindbergh Foundationlaunched Air Shepherd, a program todeter poachers with drones. Teams fly remotely piloted aircraft with night-vision cameras near potential poaching sites (as determined by a predictive algorithm) and communicate via radio with rangers on the ground who can stop any poachers in the area that the drones' cameras spot. An initiative calledRhinos Without Borders, started by filmmakers Dereck and Beverly Joubert, aims to simply move rhinos out of danger. The crowdfunded effort aims to airlift rhinos from South Africa, where some 80 percent of Africa’s rhinos live, to Botswana, where there are currently fewer poachers on the hunt for horns. Each rhino move costs around $45,000, and the group has moved 10 so far. They plan to move at least 100 in total."

Marine waste is not only a nuisance for wildlife, but for swimmers and surfers as well. In an attempt to tackle this problem,Seabin Projectis seeking funding for their automated floating trash collector onIndiegogo. The Seabin works by pumping a constant flow of water through the top of the bin, collecting nearby trash and debris in the process. The water is filtered out through the bottom of the bin and pumped back into the surrounded body of water, while any waste is caught in the bin’s natural fiber lining. The mechanism needs to be fixed to a floating dock and connected to a shore-based water pump in order to function, so the company is mainly targeting marinas, ports, and yacht clubs. Many of these places employ “trash boats” outfitted with nets as their way of dealing with waste, but this method can be expensive to run and maintain. The Seabins are being offered through Indiegogo for pledges of $3825 dollars or more, with delivery estimated for November of next year. In addition to working towards a future of waste-free oceans, one of the goals of the company is to manufacture their future Seabins using the same recycled plastic collected by other models.

The beads are great for adding a scrubby texture and exfoliating feel to liquids and gels. Unfortunately, they’re also really good at messing up the environment. For this reason, Congress has just approved a total ban on microbeads. Personal product manufacturers have been adding microbeads to toiletries like toothpaste, face wash, shower gel, and hand soap for years. They were designed to be washed down the drain, and they last a very long time. Their small size means that they can slip right through wastewater treatment filters and into our waterways. And there are alotof them: Researchers estimate that we’re releasing11 billion microbeadsinto our waters every single day. The arrival of plastic in the water is bad enough, but what it does next is even worse. Plastic attracts chemicals from the surrounding waters. The chemicals stick to the microbeads, which are thenswallowed by animals, which are swallowed by other animals. ""By the time the plastic gets downstream towards the ocean, they become these toxic pills,"" science educator Marcus Eriksentold CBS. ""Big fish eat little fish, eventually the fish is on your dinner plate, and you're eating that fish, along with all the toxins it consumed along the way.""

Under the new ban, manufacturers have until July 2017 to completely rid their products of microbeads. In the meantime, you can get a head start by choosing microbead-free products. As the evidence against microbeads began to pile up, many companies voluntarily pledged to stop using them. For a list of those companies,click here."

According to the study, 86 percent of the endangered cacti used in horticulture were harvested from wild areas. Other practices that harm the plants include residential and commercial development, agriculture, and mining. ""The results of this assessment come as a shock to us,"" lead author Barbara Goettsch, co-chairwoman of the IUCN's Cactus and Succulent Plant Specialist Group,told the BBC. ""We did not expect cacti to be so highly threatened and for illegal trade to be such an important driver of their decline.""

Meanwhile, cacti serve as an important source of food and water for many animals, including coyotes, deer, lizards, tortoises, bats, and hummingbirds. As cacti disappear, arid eco-systems will be impacted. The ICUNcurrently ranks cactias the fifth most threatened species of endangered flora and fauna, right beneath cycads, amphibians, corals, and conifers.

664,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72214/earth-friendly-drone-made-biodegradable-fungus,,"Drones can make useful tools for learning more about the environment, but in some cases they can upset the same ecosystems they’re being used to study. Now, a new type of drone is being made from biodegradable, eco-friendly materials. The ""biodrone"" was designed by ateam of studentsfrom Brown, Spelman, and Stanford Universities in collaboration withNASA’s Ames Research Center. The group’s leader, NASA biologist Lynn Rothschild, recently spoke withDiscovermagazine about the project. She says she got the idea from a previous drone crash that nearly yielded disastrous results: The 400-pound research device went missing off the Alaskan coast in 2013, but was luckily discovered by fisherman with its fuel tank still intact. Future incidents may not end so uneventfully, which is why Rothschild helped develop a drone that can crash with little environmental impact. To construct the prototype, the team worked with the material science companyEcovative. The biodrone's frame is composed of a fungal root material called mycelium, which was placed in a mold where it consumed leaf and grass cuttings until it had completely filled out the mold's shape. Themyceliumwas then dried out at 180 to 200°F, leaving a lightweight chassis. That chassis was coated with cellulose acetate, which was then itself coated with a hydrophobic protein found in paper wasp saliva to make it waterproof. The propellers were molded from the same plastic found in biodegradable forks and knives. According toDiscover, while a 100 percent biodegradable motor is still theoretical, one future possibility is a bacterial fuel cell used to provide electricity and power the propeller motors. Another potential addition is a cameramade with ultra-thin silicon that dissolves in water, or electronics printed on sheets of cellulose acetatein dissolvable silver nanoparticle ink. According toWIRED, these biodrones could also have applications on missions to Mars. By biogenerating a drone on Mars from a sample of cells, NASA would be saving both space and money on the trip there. Such a drone's biogenerative properties could also open up the possibility for one-way research missions, since there's no concern about retrieving toxic materials—instead of harming whatever environment it lands in, the drone could provide a fungus-flavored treat to creatures nearby.

665,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72464/thanks-intense-recycling-plan-japanese-town-nears-zero-waste,,"Though there once was a time when an environmentally conscious consumer had to go out of their way to recycle a glass bottle or cardboard box, those dark days are largely over. It’s not unusual to see separate bins for trash and recyclables on busy city streets, and most municipal waste departments offer curbside collection for paper, plastics, and occasionally even electronics, appliances, or hazardous materials. However, one tiny town in southwestern Japan puts all those efforts to shame. In Kamikatsu, around 2000 residents separate their everyday disposables into 34 distinct categories for recycling, which has resulted in an incredible 80 percent reduction in waste since the innovative system was implemented in 2003. If the trend continues, town officials hope that 2020 will be the landmark year in which it officially becomes “zero-waste.” The American system of recycling, with its seven types of plastics (only two of which are generally reusable),can be difficultenough for the average consumer to navigate. Kamikatsu’s34-category schemeis even more complicated, requiring residents not only to identify the difference between polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyetylene (HDPE), but also to separate razors from pens, dirty diapers from sake bottles, and steel cans from the type of styrofoam packaging used to sell raw meat. Of course, this takes place only after separating out all the organic waste, which Kamikatsu residents are required to compost at home—a crucial step that discourages letting anything go to waste in the first place. Though requiring garbage collectors to regularly pick up nearly three dozen different types of recyclables sounds like an organizational nightmare, Kamikatsu’s leaders have eschewed the problem entirely by requiring residents to deliver the recycling themselves, either to the central waste station or to a few local shops serving as middlemen. Far from seeing their enhanced environmental responsibilities as an imposition, many residents say they appreciate the encouragement to be more conscious consumers. It was admittedly a struggle for some to adjust to such a complicated new system, which mandated not only that disposed items be distributed into 34 separate receptacles, but that they be thoroughly washed of their remaining contents. This additional step in particular left some 40 percent of poll respondents in 2008 slightly unhappy with the overall waste policy, but the town has come to accept both the pros and cons. As one local womantells the BBC, “I have to do it every day; it's certainty a bit of work. But it's a good idea to send things back to the earth so I support it.” Perhaps taking inspiration from the measurable good a more conservationist waste policy has done for their town, Kamikatsu residents have found other ways to turn their trash into treasure. A “circular” shop provides a venue for neighbors to donate unwanted, but still usable, products for others to take freely, and crafty local women have grown skilled at turning old kimonos, flags, and linens into bags, teddy bears, and stylish new garments. In Kamikatsu, what might have been a failed government experiment hasbecome a way of life. [h/tGOOD]"

If he listened to the frenetic social media coverage of last week’s storm in the Arctic, he probably invested in a few dozen houseboats for his elves even before he landed back at home on Christmas evening. An unusual storm in the far northern Atlantic Ocean brought above-freezing temperatures to the North Pole for a brief time on Wednesday, December 30, 2015. The storm was indeed unusual, but in the North Pole, at least, it wasn’t quite as horrific as many people thought. To say that temperatures in the far northern latitudes around this time of the year are bitterly cold is an understatement. Average temperatures during the near-constant darkness of winter are many dozens of degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and it’s this natural refrigeration source that provides the Northern Hemisphere its worst cold spells when tendrils of the much-ballyhooed polar vortex dip southward and make us complain for days on end. (Though just last month we complained that the weather wasabnormally warm.) When we talk about low-pressure systems, most of the time we’re talking about an “extratropical cyclone,” or one that has features like cold and warm fronts swirling around the circulation. These systems feed their energy off of the jet stream, which can force enormous amounts of air to lift from the surface into the upper levels of the atmosphere, leaving less air (and thereby lower air pressure) at the surface. Mean sea level pressure between Saturday, December 27, 2015 and Monday, January 4, 2016, as forecast by the GFS model, showing the progression of the low from Texas to the Arctic Ocean. Image credit:Tropical Tidbits In the last couple of days of 2015, the strong winds of the jet stream lined up just right to allow a powerful low-pressure system to develop near Iceland. The cyclone—the origins of which you can trace back to Texas, where it would go on to spawn severe thunderstorms and flooding rains over the central United States—rapidly strengthened, reaching a minimum central pressure of 928 millibars,according to NOAA’s Ocean Prediction Center. Standard sea level pressure is 1013 millibars, and 928 millibars is a reading one would normally see in a powerful hurricane. Forecast surface temperatures for 0600 UTC Wednesday, December 30, 2015, from the GFS model on Tuesday, December 29, 2015. Image credit:Tropical Tidbits A storm this intense was able to move vast amounts of air in short order. In addition to the dangerous flooding, high waves, and damaging windsthe system brought to the United Kingdomalong its cold front, the counterclockwise winds spiraling around the low dragged a warm front all the way up to the North Pole, sending surface temperatures 50°F to 60°F above where they should be at the end of December. According totheWashington Post’s Capital Weather Gang, a buoy located about three degrees latitude—or roughly 160 miles—south of the geographic North Pole recorded a high temperature of 33°F on December 30, which is a jump of more than 50°F in 24 hours, and a reading one typically wouldn’t see in this part of the world until the middle of the summer. This kind of a polar heat wave is somewhat akin to those storm systems that sweep through the middle of the United States during the cooler months, raising temperatures to unseasonable levels for an afternoon before a cold front sweeps through and plummets you into a deep freeze. However, those are much more common than this Arctic storm, the likes of which are exceedingly rare. Whilethere is mounting evidencethat the Arctic is warming, a sudden warm-up like the one seen in the penultimate day of 2015 was a fluke, a statistical blip that’s exciting in a nerdy way and thankfully has no lasting consequences beyond giving us some cool data and probably some very confused polar bears. The flash of warmth was so brief that it likely didn’t have time to melt even the snow or ice sitting on the surface—let alone larger chunks of ice—so fear not, the ice caps (and Santa’s workshop) are safe and characteristically chilly … at least for the moment, anyway."

The coquí isn’t native to the Big Island—scientists think it arrived via some potted plants sometime in the 1980s—and their evening mating calls canreach up to 90 decibels. Not only are coquís as loud as a lawnmower, they’re also incessant. Their din lasts from dusk to dawn, disturbing locals at night. Complicating matters, the coquí has no natural predators in Hawaii, and it's thrived in its new environment, thanks to a plentiful bug population and a rocky habitat full of hiding places. It skips the tadpole stage, so it doesn’t require ponds. As a result, the Big Island’s coquí population is now three times greater than it is in Puerto Rico. (According to one study [PDF], there are 91,000 frogs per 2.5 acres; other reports vary, saying there could be more than10,000 frogs per acreor between20,000 and 50,000 per acre.) Essentially, the coquí is comparable to a bunch of raucous party-goers who weren’t invited over, but showed up anyway—and now they won’t go home. Even more troubling: officials worry that the coquí will harm the local ecosystem by consuming pollinating insects, or hurt export plant sales, theLos Angeles Timesreports. Naturally, Hawaiians are fed up—and they're taking matters into their own hands. Neighborhood watch groups hunt for coquí at night (they’re silent during daytime), and kill them by trapping them in a Ziploc bag and freezing them, according to thePost. TheLA Timesreports that some individuals douse coquí habitats with citric acid spray, spray vegetation with hot water, or relegate flowers to freezers for a few days to get rid of the animals. The Wall Street Journalwritesthat Hawaii’s Big Island had declared a coquí “state of emergency” by the mid-2000s. However, task forces have since reported that they’re resigned to the fact that the coquí is here to stay. It’s impossible to eradicate—so officials have switched gears, and are now focused on containment. Meanwhile, some animal advocates have set up frog sanctuaries and nature preserves for the coquí. Others try to catch the pesky amphibians and ship them back to Puerto Rico. Many are simply becoming acclimated to the frog’s din. For the time being, it looks like the coquí isn’t going anywhere—so Big Island residents might want to stock up on earplugs. [h/tWashington Post,Los Angeles Times,Wall Street Journal]"

But now, thanks to humans, they’re disappearing. Logging and development have savaged forests that grew, in some cases, for millennia, and less than 10 percent of old-growth forest in the U.S. still survives. But, if humans are largely responsible for destroying forests, they’re also working hard to preserve them—and one preservation group is taking a truly creative approach. According toSmithsonian, a non-profit organization called theArchangel Tree Archiveis trying to save iconic trees by cloning them. So far, the organization has compiled a list of one hundred iconic trees to preserve—but they also take requests. Scientists from the organization travel around the world, gathering genetic information from the trees, then identify new locations to plant them in. While some of the trees were selected for their impressive age, others were chosen for the historical events they stood witness to. For instance, Archangel has not only cloned California’s redwoods, but also preserved trees near the historic homes of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The project serves two primary purposes. Scientists hope to study the genetic makeup of old trees in order to determine what makes them so durable. But the organization is also interested in historic preservation: They want to ensure these trees live on for future generations. Jim Duby, the program manager for Seminole County, Fla., is one of the Archangel Tree Archive’s biggest fans. After a famous Seminole County bald cypress known as theSenator was burned downthree years ago, Duby started to worry about the many other historic trees in the area—especially the Senator’s former neighbor, an approximately 2000-year-old tree known as Lady Liberty. Fortunately, Archangel agreed to add Lady Liberty to its list. The group will be visiting Seminole County’s Big Tree Park in December to collect shoots from the ancient cypress. “I had parents who recalled going to see the Senator with their grandparents, and their grandparents had been there with their grandparents,” Duby toldSmithsonian. “I think we’d be kicking ourselves if, God forbid, something similarly tragic happened to Lady Liberty and we hadn’t done the cloning.” [h/t:Smithsonian]"

We may stop thinking about our trash once it gets taken out to the curb, but that doesn’t mean it goes away. Here are 11 fascinating things you might not know about waste. (They don't all stink, we promise.) TheEnvironmental Protection Agencyestimates that the United States throws away the equivalent of 4.4 pounds of trash per person every day. We recycle and compost about 1.5 pounds per person. However, arecent studyfound those numbers might be low—it found the U.S. dumped 289 million tons of city waste in 2012, twice the EPA’s estimate for that year. Some cities allow you to report a lost item after you’ve accidentally thrown it away. InAlbuquerque, the item has to be reported within four hours of pickup. InNew York City, at least, the item “must be of significant value.” So wedding bands, yes, lost homework, no. A dog digging through trash in Istanbul. Image Credit: iStock In urban areas, sometimes the most attractive place for a pup to pee is straight onto a garbage bag. As a dog cognition expert toldThe New York Timesin 2014, a bag full of trash on the sidewalk is “a new feature on the dog’s landscape and therefore inherently interesting. It smells like food. And because it sits above ground level, it acts as a sort of broadcast tower for a dog’s scent marking.” In Seattle, recycling regulations are getting serious. In 2015, the city banned food waste and recyclables in municipal trashes, in an effort to get people to compost. However,homeownerssued the citythis past summer arguing that letting trash collectors dig through people’s waste to enforce the regulation is a violation of residents’ constitutional right to privacy. Recycling isn’t often profitable. “In New York City, the net cost of recycling a ton of trash is now $300 more than it would cost to bury the trash instead,” writer John Tierney explained inThe New York Timesrecently. However,politicians and researchersargue that an emphasis on recycling helps encourage people to use less in the first place. One studyfound that looking at a natural landscape littered with trash didn’t give people the relaxing, restorative feelings that looking at nature normally provokes. Looking at images of a clean beach made people feel happy, but people reported being angry and sad when looking at the same beach with some trash strewn around. Cities are increasinglyrehabilitatingtheir old landfills to become public parkland. Chicago’sMount Bridgeportwas once a quarry used to dump construction waste. Austin, Texas has Mabel Davis Park, a 50-acre formerbrownfieldand dump. However, because of potential contamination, the rehabilitation process can take decades.Staten Island’sdump, once the largest landfill in the world, will become a 2200 acre park by 2036. Small pieces of plastic trash and debris accumulate in certain parts of the ocean because of currents and wind. However, theGreat Pacific garbage patchis not a trash island, as you might imagine it. “A comparison I like to use is that the debris is more like flecks of pepper floating throughout a bowl of soup, rather than a skim of fat that accumulates (or sits) on the surface,” as a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientistputs it. Think of it as a big, salty trash smoothie. Cities don’t always bury their garbage nearby. When MIT researchers attached trackers to 3000 pieces of Seattle trash in 2009, they found the waste ended up all over the country.In the late ‘80s, New York City shut down its local landfills and filled a barge with 3000 tons of trash, sending it down to North Carolina. The state, as well as several other potential destinations, decided not to take it. After months of seeking a port, the barge dumped its contents in Brooklyn, where it was incinerated. Now, the city’s trash isshipped outof state to New Jersey, Ohio, and other areas. At one dump in Kentucky, 80 to 90 percent of waste came from other states, until the program wasdiscontinuedthis year. (The residents found thousands of tons of incoming waste a day to be a little smelly.) The European country sendsless than 1 percentof its household waste to landfills, thanks to waste-to-energy plants that incinerate trash to produce electricity. The program is so successful that Sweden has begunimportingother countries’ trash to provide its residents with heating.

About13 million tonsflow into the sea each year, and experts say that amount will only increase. This pollution holds severe consequences for our ecosystem—especially for sea birds. A team of Australian researchers evaluated 135 seabird species around the world and found that 59 percent of them had ingested plastic, and within that group 29 percent had plastic in their gut. Using this data, the researchers estimated that a staggering 90 percent of sea birds have consumed plastic of some kind—either accidentally or because they mistook it for food. The researchers predict that, by the year 2050, this number will rise to 99 percent. The findings, which were published this week in thejournalPNAS, gave researchers “a global prediction of how wide-reaching plastic impacts may be on marine species—and the results are striking,""according to Dr. Chris Wilcox, the study’s lead author. The study, which tracked plastic ingestion rates over time, found that less than five percent of birds had plastic in their stomachs in 1960. This percentage had swelled to 80 percent by 2010. Researchers say this is due to the increasing rate of global plastic manufacturing, which doubles every year. Since approximately 80 percent of marine litter—most of it plastic—comes from land, scientists hope improved waste management practices will help save the ocean’s ecosystem. ""Improving waste management can reduce the threat plastic is posing to marine wildlife,"" said Dr. Denise Hardesty, the study's co-author. ""Even simple measures can make a difference, such as reducing packaging, banning single-use plastic items or charging an extra fee to use them, and introducing deposits for recyclable items like drink containers.”"

They documented their efforts with inscriptions they wrote on the cave walls. ""On May 24th, 17th year of the Emperor Guangxu period, Qing Dynasty, the local mayor, Huaizong Zhu led more than 200 people into the cave to get water. A fortune-teller named Zhenrong Ran prayed for rain during the ceremony,” someone wrote on the wall in 1891. More than 350 years earlier, in 1528, another water seeker wrote: “Drought occurred in the 7th year of the Emperor Jiajing period, Ming Dynasty. Gui Jiang and Sishan Jiang came to Da’an town to acknowledge the Dragon Lake inside in Dayu Cave.” Their tone was matter of fact, but their situations were dire. The droughts that afflicted central China in the 1890s led to severe starvation, social instability, and eventually to a fierce conflict between government and civilians in 1900. And the drought of 1528 caused such widespread starvation that there were reports of cannibalism. These inscriptions are just two of several on the walls of Dayu Cave in the Qinling Mountains of central China thatdescribe the impactsof seven drought events between 1520 and 1920. As they recently published in the journalScientific Reports, a team of researchers from China, the U.K., and the U.S. have been studying not only the inscriptions but the cave they were found in. What makes this research unique is that the researchers have been able to piece together a record of periodic droughts in the region thanks to both the inscriptions and to a detailed chemical analysis of stalagmites in the cave. They say it's the first time it has been possible to conduct anin situcomparison of historical and geological records from the same cave. The climate in the area around the cave is dominated by the summer monsoon, in which about 70 percent of the year’s rain falls during a few months. An ill-timed or unusually short (or long) monsoon makes a major impact on the region’s ecosystem. The locals were well aware of this, as the inscriptions show. They visited the cave at least 70 times between 1520 and 1920. Their inscriptions document seven major droughts, the first in 1528 and the last in 1894. The researchers compared this information with a chemical analysis of the stable isotopes and trace elements contained within cave formations, or speleothems—especially stalagmites. (When cut open, stalagmites frequently reveal a series of layers that record their annual growth, just like tree rings.) Using mass spectrometry, the researchers dated the ratios of the stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon, as well as concentrations of uranium and other elements, all of which are affected by changes in climate, moisture levels, and vegetation around the cave. The researchers found that higher oxygen and carbon isotope ratios corresponded with lower rainfall levels, and vice versa. Based on these results, the researchers also constructed a model of future precipitation in the region, starting in 1982. Their model correlated with a drought that occurred in the 1990s—and suggests another drought in the late 2030s. Such climate changes have destabilized many cultures before, including in China,saysCambridge University's Sebastian Breitenbach, a co-author of the paper: “In the past decade, records found in caves and lakes have shown a possible link between climate change and the demise of several Chinese dynasties during the last 1800 years, such as the Tang, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties.” ""With direct historical evidences, our results suggest that droughts and even modest events interrupting otherwise wet intervals can cause serious social crises,"" the researcherswrite, adding ""that future precipitation in central China may be below the average of the past 500 years. As Qinling Mountain is the main recharge area of two large water transfer projects and habitats of many endangered species, it is imperative to explore an adaptive strategy for the decline in precipitation and/or drought events."""

Also known as the ""Huldufolk"" or ""hidden people,"" elf mythology dates back centuries, and is seen as an important part of Iceland’s cultural heritage. So, in 2014, when a group of Icelandic environmental activists began protesting a planned road development on the basis that it would disrupt an elf village, their complaints were taken seriously. According toThe Independent, environmentalists claimed the proposed road would not only pass through an invisible elf community, but cut through previously protected lava fields, disturbing several animal nesting sites. Joining forces with a group of elf believers and calling themselves “Friends of the Lava,” the environmentalists protested the development on both environmental and mystical grounds. They were led by Ragnhildur Jónsdóttir, an environmentalist and elf seer who operates anElf Gardennear Reykjavík. According toThe Atlantic, Jónsdóttir investigated the site of the proposed road and, after thoroughly exploring the area, provided testimony that ""a very important elf church"" atop a large rock would be destroyed if the road were built. Though elves are invisible to most people, Jónsdóttir claims to be able to communicate with them, and conveyed their displeasure with the road plan to the press. The elves, speaking through Jónsdóttir, also made it clear that this was an environmental issue: Jónsdóttir explained that while elves are able to move their homes (albeit often reluctantly), they refuse to do so for what they see as unworthy causes.

When Nabokov discovered and named theKarner bluebutterfly in the 1940s, the species (Lycaeides melissasamuelis)was already on the decline. Experts estimate that in the past 100 years, the Karner blue population has dropped by 99 percent. Its dwindling numbers earned the postage stamp–sized butterfly one of the first spots on the then-new U.S.Endangered Species Listin 1973. Now the nearly extinct Karner blue is making a comeback, thanks to two decades of concerted effort by conservationists. Nabokov accurately noted that the Karner's decline was occurring in tandem with the loss of the pine barrens, its favored habitat. That's why for the past 20 years, conservationists have tried torejuvenate the speciesby restoring the pine barrens through selective burning of the landscape, which destroys invasive plants and makes room for fire-dependent species like pitch pine and scrub oak to thrive. These efforts haven't been uniformly successful across the butterfly's former range, which stretches from Minnesota to New England. For instance, the Karner blue is likely gone for good from Indiana, where 20 years ago biologists reported seeing 5,000 to 10,000 of the species but so far this year haven't found a single one. (They found two in 2014.) But in central New York, where the butterfly was first discovered by Nabokov in the pine bush just outside Albany, the numbers are promising—the result of not only habitat restoration but a captive breeding program collaboration between New York and New Hampshire. Each year since 2001, New York has sent adult Karner blues to New Hampshire, and New Hampshire has returned some of the pupating larvae to Albany. These efforts have seen the Karner population bounce back from a mere 200 butterflies in 1991 to more than 14,000 today, according to Neil Gifford, conservation director for the 3,200-acreAlbany Pine Bush Preserve.

677,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67555/divers-robots-and-toilets-saving-nycs-water-supply,,"The first man to notice New York City’s $1.6 billion problem was a utility worker. Standing near the Hudson River in 1988, he saw it was at low tide, which revealed a separate body of water bubbling up near the shore and spilling into the main current. That didn’t seem right at all. The worker notified the city’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Back then, New York was using copper sulfate to control algae in the Delaware Aqueduct supply, one of the city’s three main arteries for water. At 85 miles long, it’s also thelongest continuous tunnelin the world. Scientists tested the gurgling, burbling pond. It was positive for copper sulfate. Somewhere 700 feet below the surface was a pressurized tunnel approaching 50 years of age that was going to need to be repaired to stop the 15 to 35 million gallon hemorrhage occurring daily. “The dilemma was not just the fact there are cracks in a tunnel hundreds of feet below ground,” Adam Bosch, DEP’s Director of Public Affairs, tellsmental_floss. “It was, where is New York City going to get its water if we shut the Aqueduct down for a year or more?” The answer is a succession of engineering feats that rival any in the city’s history: enlisting skilled divers to maneuver a 23,000 pound submerged bulkhead in place, assembling a massive drill underground to tunnel two miles horizontally, and campaigning citizens to begin conserving water for the day the Aqueduct—which delivers over half of the city’s drinking water—is drained down to its last drop. Shaft 6, the access point where the Aqueduct will eventually be drained. Image courtesy of Global Diving. The blame falls mainly with limestone.The coffee cake of rock, it crumbles easily and provides poor support when civilization decides to burrow underground. The men who labored to install the Aqueduct in the 1940s lined the weaker areas with steel, trusting the bedrock in other areas wouldn’t need any additional support. They were right—up to a point. “We’re seeing the cracks right where the steel liner ends,” Bosch says. “The belief is, if the workers had just gone a few hundred yards further with the liner, we wouldn’t have any leaks right now.” After the symptoms—the leaks—were confirmed in the late 1980s, the city spent most of the 1990s working on a diagnosis. It's been a slow excavation of information that frustrated nearby residents who were suffering from the consequences of water seepage: The town of Wawarsing saw flooded basements and mold issues that were so severe they promptedcity buyouts. “You have to consider everything,” Bosch says. “There are no small problems.” After establishing the tunnel wasn’t in danger of collapse—under pressure, it can’t crumble inwardly—the DEP was able to confirm the location of the two leak sites by using a remote-controlled submersible vehicle that took pictures of the cracks in the early 2000s. Photographs taken five years later, Bosch says, have shown the leaks haven’t gotten any worse. More recently, a vehicle able to inject dye into suspected areas confirmed the site affecting Wawarsing had coin-sized holes that could be repaired by simple grouting once the Aqueduct is drained. The other site, near the Hudson, is long past the point of bandaging: It will need a2.5-mile longbypass installed to circumvent the damage entirely. In order to connect the bypass and repair the leaks, engineers will have to drain the tunnel. To do that, they’ll have to upgrade the pump system in Shaft 6, one of the key access points to the Aqueduct located in Wappinger. That, too, would have to be drained in order to install the pumps. The need to inspect, reinforce, and prepare Shaft 6 for that forthcoming duty fell to a team of six divers who spent weeks at a stretch living and working in a pressurized environment. Their job would be to insert a massive bulkhead that will help handle the millions of pounds of water pressure looming near workers—a fit so precise it allows less than a quarter of an inch of room on any one side. To dive nearly 700 feet below the surface to perform the work needed in Shaft 6, however, wasn’t going to be easy. It would require 12-hour shifts, one after another. Having men work just one day and then decompressing was not only impractical, it would render an already glacial process almost interminable. The solution: live under pressure. Global Diving Global Diving, the salvage operation out of Seattlecontracted by DEP to handle duties for Shaft 6 in 2007, had six divers spending weeks at a stretch cut off from the outside world. This is known as saturation diving, which allows for divers to avoid decompression until the end of their tenure—typically a month. The “saturation” is the maximum amount if nitrogen that’s been built up in the body: it’s not going to be any more whether the diver spends a day or a week under compression. In order to remain at pressure, the divers lived in a customized chamber built over the mouth of the shaft. The 24-foot enclosure resembled a kind of mobile home by way of NASA, with bedding, a shower, and a “med lock” that allowed support staff to deliver fresh laundry, food, and other supplies without compromising the crushing, oppressive air the divers had to endure. “Say you go down 600 feet,” says Donald Hosford, one of the divers on the project. “It’s about .445 pounds per square inch for every foot. That’s about 300 PSI. That’s like me sitting on your chest and you trying to breathe.” Divers had to avoid major exertion—“no jumping jacks,” Hosford says—and some suffered a degree of muscle atrophy. “You’re sitting on a rack and not using your leg muscles.” Hosford, at 6-foot-6, didn’t spend a lot of time standing up. Because there’s too much nitrogen in oxygen at that depth, the divers would breathe a 97 percent solution of helium. Their voices were always balloon-high, which meant some of the crew had to use a descrambler to understand them. (While initially bizarre, divers eventually develop “helium ear,” and the high-pitched tones begin to sound normal to everyone but the support staff.) Before any restoration work could begin, Global first took a sample of the bronze door that separates Shaft 6 from the Aqueduct to assess its condition. It was in immaculate shape, but DEP wanted to take precautions. Global fabricated a 23,000 pound bulkhead,5 feet wide and 7 feet tall, made from concrete that would fit so snugly—with just a quarter-inch of give on any one side—that the company rehearsed its fitting before attempting it underwater. When DEP was satisfied it could be done, the bulkhead was lowered down the shaft on a crane and glided across a train track assembly to connect to the existing door. Because everything needed for the job had to fit in Shaft 6’s 13-foot diameter opening, tools to facilitate the job werebuiltfrom scratch. And since most were bigger than the 8-foot diameter diving bell could contain, they had to be lowered and retrieved each time. Fitting the bulkhead took roughly two weeks. By the time divers performed a 12-hour shift and returned to the chamber, they had just enough time to sleep and get an hour or two of reading in before the next shift began. (Because of fire concerns, electronic devices are largely forbidden.) After five years of scouting work, planning, fabrication, and fitting, Global finished the project inJune 2012. To decompress, the divers spent roughly a day in the chamber for every 100 feet they had been under. After a week of that, Hosford says, “it was just about getting re-acclimated to society.” The drift split off from Shaft 6 where divers were lowered to work on reinforcing the bronze door bulkhead. Once drained, it will have to withstand millions of pounds of force from the Aqueduct. Image courtesy of Global Diving. Though New York City’s population has grown by over a millionsince the 1980s, water consumption has gone down. “The peak water use was 1.6 billion gallons in 1979,” Bosch says. “Today it’s roughly a billion. That’s down by a third.” Part of the reason is an effort by officials and citizens to become eco-conscious, installing low-flow toilets, shower heads and front-loading washers in residential and commercial buildings. The conservation couldn’t have come at a better time, since reduced usage has allowed the city torelyon the existing Catskill and Croton source as the replacement water supplies while the Delaware tunnel is dry for the six to 15 months it will take to allow for the bypass connection. “It’s enough to sustain the new normal of one billion,” Bosch says. Currently, workers are boring into ground in the towns of Newburgh and Wappinger to create new access tunnels between 700 and 900 feet below the Hudson. Once they’ve hit bottom—or their version of it—a formidable boring machine will be lowered in pieces and assembled under Newburgh. From there, it will begin the 2.5 mile journey to Wappinger. Bosch expects the drill will move 50 feet a day, upchucking earth to make room for the bypass tunnel. The tunnel will be gravity-fed, meaning Wappinger’s side of the bypass will rest below Newburgh’s—but only by about 5 feet. “It’s incredibly precise,” Bosch says. (And one of the reasons two drills can’t just plow toward one another in half the time.) The Delaware Aqueduct is expected to be back online in 2024, ending decades of painstaking assessment and problem-solving. “This is the largest repair of the city’s water supply in its 180-year history,” Bosch says. “We wanted to stop the losses as soon as possible, but we had to make sure the repair is the right repair.”"

It's a wave of misfortune approachingBiblical proportions. First came the pests:Bactrocera oleae, the aptly named olive fruit fly. The insects merrily repopulated among Italy’s trees during this past olive season, as eggs laid in the fruit hatched into larvae that consumed it, before growing to maturity and starting the cycle over and over again. The Puglia region suffered doubly, not only from its native pests, but also a foreign bacterial infection calledXylella fastidiosa, suspected to be an accidental import from Costa Rica. The bacteria—already infamous as the bane of California vineyards and Brazilian citrus groves—is now taking Italian trees hostage, subjecting fruit-bearing plants to slow, diseased deaths. Almond, oleander, and cherry trees have also been found to harbor the undesirable bacteria, although olive trees are themain victims. Though a desperate plan by the EU has already designated 25 miles of the surrounding area in southern Italy as “buffer zones,” they been forced to cull thirty-five thousand olive trees to date, with up to a million more potentially at stake. The fact that Spain and Italy alone are responsible for so much of the world's olive oil production can be attributed to their ideal olive-growing climate: long, hot summers and cool, but not cold, winters. However, olives, like most living things, tend to suffer in extremes, like flooding and hail in Italy and major drought in Spain. All told, the International Olive Councilanticipates a global shortageof olive oil that no amount of good weather in other countries can compensate for. Although the United States is the biggest olive oil consumer outside the European Union, accounting for 10 percent of total global olive oil use, we seem to be a nation more of takers than givers.

Image Credit: Colleen Kimmett Only half of Indonesia's original forests remain, and a major culprit for the ongoing deforestation—an estimated 2 million acres of forest disappear every year—is the global demand for palm oil. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of the most widely used vegetable oil on the planet.Palm oil iseverywhere: in shampoo, lipstick, pizza dough, soap, biodiesel—even in chocolate. It's been illegal to clear forest in Indonesia since 2011, but political corruption means many turn a blind eye toward illegal plantations. That's why, in the mid-2000s, Putra decided that if the Indonesian government wouldn't enforce the law, he would. With the help of oilman-turned-conservationistMike Griffiths, Putra assembled a team of young conservationists and armed them with smart phones and GPS software. These field monitors compare real-time data with maps of concession zones to determine which companies are overstepping their plantation boundaries. He enlists local communities, politicians, and police chiefs—many of whom at first called him ""the crazy man"" for daring to take on the powerful plantation companies—and then visits the offices of the offending palm companies. More often than not, the CEOs quietly agree to stop the illegal planting. That's when Putra and his team pick up their chainsaws. Quiet and unassuming, Putra has learned four different languages spoken on Sumatra so he can better communicate with local communities. It hasn't been easy. “There have been many unconvinced at first,” he tellsmental_floss. “But when we sit together in a local house and talk, eventually they support my work.” As governments around the world spend millions on reforestation projects focused on planting new trees, Putra's chainsaw environmentalism is an example of alow-cost, low-tech tacticthat works. Maybe sometimes the most effective thing we can do is to make room for nature to take its course—and then leave it alone."

And as the ice disappears, centuries-old wildlife, plants, and human tools are reappearing on the landscape. It’s a bonanza for archaeologists, who rarely find so many important specimens at once. Unfortunately, it comes at a price: The artifacts are emerging at such a rate that scientists are unable to collect and preserve them all.According toSmithsonian, the ice once preserved a range of organic artifacts, like baskets and clothing, that would have decomposed under normal circumstances. But now that the glaciers are gone, these artifacts are disintegrating at an alarming rate. So far, the archaeologists at Yellowstone have discovered artifacts ranging from a few hundred to 10,000 years old. These include ancient animals, trees, wooden weapons, and a variety of tools. Yellowstone archaeologist Staffan Peterson even discovered a wooden tool he thinks was once used to spread resin—an “item he never knew existed,”according to WyoFile. It’s bittersweet news for the scientists—the artifacts they manage to preserve will provide important insights into the past, but each lost artifact feels like a missed opportunity. Peterson told WyoFile, ""I get the feeling of ‘My God, these things are melting right in front of me, and any value they have for science is melting away with them."" This isn't the only example of climate change fueling archaeological discovery. ""Ice patch archaeology"" is currently practiced in a number of regions. Meanwhile, droughts and wildfires have revealed a slew of Native American artifacts in California's state parks. Unfortunately, as theMonterey Heraldreports, looters have been snatching up the artifacts before archaeologists can get to them. [h/tSmithsonian]"

But not all is sunny in the golden state. 2015 marks California’s fourth consecutive year of drought. According to theU.S. Drought Monitor, 71% of the state is considered to be in “extreme drought,” and only 0.14% is not experiencing drought at all—meaning a whopping 99.86% of the state is at least “abnormally dry.” In the photo above, weeds grow from the cracked earth that used to be the bed of Lake McClure near La Grange. Images like this are becoming increasingly common in California as the drought continues into its fourth year.

The most populous state in the U.S. with almost 39 million people,California is mostly arid. Los Angeles is notoriously dry, which means thatmost of the city’s water travels a long distance, from the Colorado River or the Owens Valley. This is the exposed dam wall and water intake of the San Luis reservoir,which is currently at 22% capacity. Getty Images 5.Some of Los Angeles’s water also comes from the tributaries of Mono Lake, shown here. The south end of the lake is dotted with the rocky towers pictured here, called tufa, which are calcium carbonate (limestone) structures formed when water from calcium-rich underground springs mixes with carbonates in lakewater. The tufa were once almost entirely underwater, but as the water recedes, they become increasingly exposed. The Mono Lake Committee has beenfighting to restore water levels since 1978.

Getty Images 8.The drought affects more than just humans and soil. It also disrupts ecosystems, causing ripple effects up and down the food chain. At Mono Lake, for example, salinity has been rising as the water level falls, making the lakeless hospitable to brine shrimp, which in turn takes away an important resting stop for migrating birds that typically feed on the shrimp. Salton Sea has been losing water since before the current drought. As a result, it’s known for its beach full of fish skeletons. As the water level decreases, the algae growth has boomed, as seen here. Note the murky-colored waves.

Because the lake contains high levels of pesticides like DDT and arsenic, as it dries, these poisons settle in the dust and become airborne.

685,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/65502/most-mountains-arent-shaped-you-think-they-are,,"If we asked you to picture a mountain, you’d probably imagine something that kind of looks like a pyramid, right? It has a broad bottom with rising slopes that narrow to a tiny peak. But it turns out mountains are a lot more varied than we knew—and that's good news for animals that are shifting their ranges to higher elevations to escape rising temperatures caused by global warming. A newstudyby ecologists Paul Elsen and Morgan Tingley finds that mountains are more diverse in shape than we thought, with many havingmorespace at higher elevations. This suggests that some animals may fare better the higher they climb. On a pyramid-shaped mountain, there's limited space and fewer resources for animals the higher they go. As they climb, their numbers will drop. When they finally reach the peak, they'll have no place left to go, and they may go extinct—figuratively pushed off the top. But when Elsen and Tingley mapped out the relationships between area and elevation for almost 200 mountain ranges around the world, theyfoundthat pyramid-shaped mountains are the exception rather than the rule. The researchers discovered a surprising variety of land patterns and quite a bit of space at the top of some mountains. Only about one-third of the mountains they studied had decreased area as the elevation increased. The rest had other topography patterns that the researchers dubbed “inverse pyramid” (area increases with elevation), “diamond” (less area at the top and bottom, more in the middle) and “hourglass” (more area at the top and bottom, less in the middle). Depending on the mountain, then, climbing higher may not be a death sentence for a species. For example, animals living in the middle ranges of the Himalayas, which have an hourglass pattern, will have plenty more living space when they head into roomier, higher elevations. Still, others won’t be so lucky. Animals at the bottom of hourglass ranges or the middle of diamond ranges will be squeezing into tighter spaces as they climb, and species already living at the highest elevations have no place else to turn. Plus, a lack of space isn’t the only issue. Some species may be hurt by moving into new habitat types, leaving food sources behind or running into new predators. Elsen and Tingley hope, though, that their findings will help conservationists predict where and when ascending species will be most vulnerable and target their efforts accordingly."

I had a sweet bowl cut, sneakers that lit up when I ran, and all theEcto CoolerI could drink. But there was also plenty going on during that decade that was awful and scary. Fortunately, most of the things that terrified me when I was a kid have been vanquished, or at least faded away from the national consciousness to make room for new boogeymen. Here, we catch up with eight things that scared us 20 years ago, but don’t get the attention they used to. Thinkstock Acid rainiswhat you getwhen chemical emissions from man-made and natural sources react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form acidic compounds that come back down to Earth in precipitation. In the early '90s, the federal government went after acid rain with strengthened environmental regulations. A 1990amendmentto the Clean Air Act required reductions in the types of emissions that led to acid rain, by way of cap-and-trade programs like the EPA’sClean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR)and theAcid Rain Program (ARP)and technology like smokestack “scrubbers” and low-nitrogen-oxide burners. Emissions began tofalldramatically and are now millions of tons lower than they were in the late '80s and early '90s—at least in the U.S. Lax regulation and expanding industrialization and fossil fuel use in some countries, particularly China, led to anincreasein acid rain–forming emissions and instances of acid rain in those places in the early 2000s that have only recently begun to be fixed. So while we've made some progress, acid rainremains a threat. Wikimedia Commons Theozone layeris a part of the atmosphere that conveniently protects us from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet light. In 1985, we discovered a big hole in it. As Ethan Trextoldus in 2012, it's still there. What’s more, asecond holewas identified in 2011. Both are pretty well under control, though. In an unprecedented moment of cooperation, every member state of the United Nations ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocol and agreed to phase out the use of ozone-depletingchlorofluorocarbons(CFCs)—chemical compounds used in aerosol sprayers and as refrigerants. CFCs hang around for a while, but as they disappear, the ozone layer is slowly repairing itself and patching the holes. Given the repair rates, scientists project that we’ll be back at pre-CFCs ozone levels sometime between 2050 and 2080. NASA continues tokeep an eye on it. Wikimedia Commons In the 1950s, African and European honey beesescapedfrom an experimental apiary, or “bee yard,” in Brazil and started making hybrid bee babies in the wild. The resulting Africanized honey bees outcompeted native bees for resources and took over their hives. They spread north and south through South and Central America and, in October 1990, reached the United States. Their arrival was talked about like a monster movie, with swarms of hyper-aggressive “killer” bees swooping down from the sky to maim and murder us. The reality is that, while the hybrids inherited their African ancestors’ tendency to pursue and attack perceived threats in large numbers, and have killed people and animals, we haven’t seen the bloodbath people feared. In the years the bees have been here, people in the South andSouthwesthave simply learned to live with them. Most people never meet a killer bee, and entomologists from the Department of Agriculture have developed tools and techniques—like bee-proof clothing and “swarm traps”—to protect those that do come in contact with them. But it's not all good news. Recently there have been reports of sometimes deadlyattacks. Getty Images This might just be sampling bias on my part, but it felt like you couldn’t talk about horror books or movies in the pre-Scream'90s without the shadow of Stephen King looming over you. There was even a great libraryPSAthat featured King creeping out patrons. Not long after his 37th novel,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, was published in 1999, King was hit by a car while walking along Maine’s Route 5. He suffered a collapsed lung, multiple fractures in one leg, a broken hip, and cuts on his head. During his recovery, King announced that he was going to retire, since his injuries made sitting uncomfortable and working long hours difficult. He continued to write, butheld offon publishing, and eventually returned to releasing new material. He now seems to be back to his prolific self. In the past year alone, he won anEdgar Award for Best Novelfor the hard-boiled detective taleMr. Mercedes, published the book's sequel,Finders Keepers, and has a short story collection coming out in November calledThe Bazaar of Bad Dreams. I think he'd prefer you read those stories thanthese seven tales.  Thinkstock When the calendars rolled over from the last day of 1999 to the first of 2000, the world’s computers were supposed to be in trouble. Since many computers used six-digit dates (dd/mm/yy) to save digital space, thechangefrom 99 to 00 would cause problems for date mathematics and systems that check valid dates (like credit card processing). Companies, governments, and individuals spent an estimated $550 million to upgrade and fix their systems, and the world didn’t end on New Year’s Day. There were glitches here and there—including at a few power plants, the Pentagon, an ATF office, and an Amtrak control center—but nothing that wiped out the global economy or brought death raining down from the sky. “I’m pleased to report what you already know—that we don’t have anything to report,” FEMA director James Lee Witt told reporters at the time. We might have to go through the Y2K headache all over again in a few decades, though. Anotherdating problemaffects systems that use thestandard time library, which stores and calculates time and date values using a counter zeroed at midnight on January 1, 1970, 12:00:00 a.m. The farthest these counters can get from that 0 before rolling over to a negative number is 2,147,483,647 seconds, which they’ll hit at 3:14:07a.m.on January 19, 2038, which some are callingthe Y2038 problem. Getty Images Throughout the late '80s and early '90s, some peoplebelievedthat a nationally organized, highly structured Satanic cult operated in secret rightunderall of our noses. Almost anywhere a kid cried molestation or a dog turned up dead in an abandoned house, some people blamed the Satanists. They formed community groups and task forces to deal with the Satanists, produced hour-long evening news special reports about the Satanists, and generally threw a lot of time, money, and effort at making the Satanists go away (including theMcMartin Preschoolcase, which produced no convictions and was at the time the longest, costliest trial in American history). The hitch is that there’s almost no evidence that such a cult exists or existed. What’s more, the cult’s activities, as they were perceived and described, don’t even make sense. “Satanists allegedly have a tightly organized, powerful, infallible network that leaves no evidence of its large-scale abduction, breeding and human sacrifice activity,” sociologist David Bromley says inThe Satanism Scare. “Yet these groups also supposedly leave behind a trail of clues such as animal carcasses and open graves that invite official investigation.” Bromley continues: “Even if satanists sacrificed only 10,000 children—rather than the more commonly cited 50,000 children per year—the time period covered by current survivors' claims would have produced 400,000 victims, a total rivaling the 517,347 war-related deaths from the Second World War, the Korean, and Vietnam wars combined. Yet, not a single casualty of the satanic cult network has been discovered.” The national Satanic Cult, most sociologists have concluded, wasn’t real. Instead, the Satanism scare was just a collective overreaction to scattered, isolated events and fueled by media publicity given to the cult narrative. One thing that is real: TheChurch of Satan, which, according to itsinformation for prison chaplains, endorses ""a rational philosophy of pragmatism, materialism and skepticism, generally promoting a libertarian point of social view with an emphasis on law and order.""

Since then, some of those nukes have been dismantled, but others remain fully functional. Russia and some other former Soviet republics also still have stockpiles of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium. While Russia probably won’t use a nuke on us any time soon, there’s a valid concern that some of these weapons and nuclear materials—“secured” at poorly guarded, underfunded facilities—might fall into the hands of people who would. Thankfully, the Council on Foreign Relationssaysthat there are no confirmed reports of missing or stolen former-Soviet nuclear weapons, despite hundreds of attempted nuclear smuggling deals.

The dirt and miscellaneous particles that inevitably accumulate and become embedded in hard urban surfaces seems to be a natural symptom of city life. But new research suggests that we may need to revisit what we thought we knew about grime. Scientists have long theorized that grime (a mix of thousands of chemical compounds emitted by cars, trucks, and factories) trapped in place chemical compounds like nitrogen oxides, which can combine with volatile organic compounds to create ozone, the main component of smog. To test this theory, researchers led by University of Toronto chemistry professor James Donaldsonstudied the filth on a rooftopin Leipzig, Germany, both in the sun and in the cover of shade, by leaving trays filled with window glass beads on the building for six weeks. (Because they have more surface area, the glass beads can accumulate more grime than a flat surface like a window can.) The researchers found that the beads placed in the sun contained 10 percent less nitrate than the shaded beads. “Rather than being a permanent sink for nitrogen oxide gases, grime exposed to sunlight can re-release some of these gases back into the urban atmosphere,” Donaldson explained at an American Chemical Society conference in Boston. These findings are consistent with findings Donaldson and his team had previously made in the lab. The idea that grime may be making city air even worse than we thought is troubling. “If our suspicions are correct, it means that the current understanding of urban air pollution is missing a big chunk of information,”Donaldson said. In their continuing research, he and his team plan to conduct similar tests in very dirty and very clean cities. They also want to learn how humidity and varying degrees of sunlight exposure contribute to the problem."

Scientists are working hard to develop new forms of biodegradable plastic that will ease this issue in the future. But as for the existing trash, innovative recycling is the best way to fight the tide of plastic pollution. Environmental programs are extricating pounds of plastic waste from the oceans and now Adidas is giving some of that material new life in the form of sneakers. Later this year, the company will release a line of shoes made from plastic collected along beaches and pulled up from the ocean floor. For now, they won't be collecting the tiny fragments of plastic that float about the water—doing so simply isn't feasible—but by pulling from the coastline, they'll prevent new plastic from entering the ocean ecosystem. ""We're saving life. Every piece of plastic that we collect, every single piece, can save a bird, a turtle, even a whale,"" Cyrill Gutsch, founder of Parley for the Oceans, a new Adidas-supported nonprofit, toldFast Company. In addition to using recycled trash for the shoe's material, Adidas will employ aknitting processthat virtually eliminates further waste. Unlike cutting out a pattern to sew together, a woven structure doesn't leave behind scrap material. ""We use what we need for the shoe and waste nothing,"" said Eric Liedtke, Adidas Group executive board member of global brands. The prototype incorporates an illegal gill net—dredged up from the ocean by the nonprofit Sea Shepard—that not only saves fish lives in its absence but also gives the shoes an interesting aesthetic. It's unclear if commercial versions of the shoes will look the same, but as Adidas gets more fluent in the process of giving trash plastic new life, they're hoping to expand beyond footwear. ""We don't have to limit ourselves,"" said Lietke. ""We can put this in T-shirts, we can put this in shorts, we can put this in all kinds of stuff."""

They’re also bad for your mental health. Looking at a beach with garbage on it undermines the otherwise restorative quality of looking at nature, according to a new study published in the journalEnvironment and Behavior.It probably won't come as a surprise that looking at litter is a bummer. But it turns out our reaction to dirty beaches depends on the kind of litter we see. Kayleigh Wyles, an environmental psychologist at Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the UK, photographed beaches covered in plastic bags, empty bottles, and other detritus she had carefully placed in the sand (and later removed). She then showed the images to participants in three different lab experiments. Participants rated clean, pristine beaches as more restorative, calming environments than beaches that had trash on them. What kind of garbage was on the beach mattered, though. She found that viewers rated beaches covered in fishing-related litter more highly than beaches filled with old candy wrappers and bags of chips, in part because they viewed the latter group to be evidence of deliberate littering and a sign of disrespect, while they didn't hold old fishing nets to the same standard. People reported being angry or sad as they thought about the environmental consequences of the litter. But the site of a clean beach left them feeling happy and relaxed. Scientists have found increasing evidence that spending time looking at nature isgood for mental health. An idea calledattention restoration theory, firstintroducedin 1989, says that looking at natural scenery boosts concentration and decreases stress by providing a break from the constant psychological stimulation of urban environments, where there’s always something the brain wants topay attention to. But beaches that would otherwise be mental health boosters may not be as beneficial if they’re covered in shiny trash that prompts people to think about pollution and how humanity is killing birds and marine life by dumping8 million metric tonsof trash into the ocean every year.

690,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/65712/what-are-coyotes-doing-big-apple,,"Their howls pierce the night air in a declaration of wildness. This call, when it sweeps across the rolling hills of Appalachia or the Mojave flats, resonates with the romance of the backcountry. But when it's heard by someone walking down Broadway, it seems eerily out of place. Opportunities to experience nature are not usually why people choose to live in New York City, but that's what many New Yorkers have been experiencing now that coyotes are taking their best shot at adopting the cosmopolitan lifestyle of the Big Apple. This past spring the canines were spottedatop a Long Island City bar, strolling down theUpper West Sideand throughBattery Park, and even atLaGuardia Airport. The sightings spurred something of a coyote frenzy in print, with articles appearing everywhere fromNational GeographictoTheNew Yorker.Not because this is the first time the species has ventured into cities—in fact, just about every city in North America has a population of coyotes within, includingan estimated 2000 that now call downtown Chicago home. But if there’s a symbol of the concrete jungle, it’s New York. The fact that carnivorous wildlife is making its home on the mean streets is like taking down the fence posts of the constructed boundary between what we consider manmade and what we consider wild. If the coyotes can make it here, they'll make it anywhere. How coyotes have found themselves in urban environments has as much to do with us as it does with them. These new city slickers are not returning to reestablish residence in their natural homelands. In fact, while the species can now be found in all corners of our continent, 1000 years ago coyotes were only found in the deserts and prairies of the West. Coyotes came to the big city via a path that we laid out for them, driven by the perpetual search for a niche to fill. Our development of prime coyote habitat around New York happened over the last 200 years, as human inhabitants first cut down broad swaths of forest and then, more recently, began to let some of that forest regrow. “We’ve created a landscape that—other than the roads—is perfect for deer, raccoon, fox, and coyotes,” Chris Nagy, a wildlife biologist with the Gotham Coyote Project, told mental_floss. “It’s a young forest, with lots of small mammals."" And those small creatures are the perfect coyote food. We’ve also done coyotes a big favor by practically wiping out their chief competitors: wolves. Through hunting and development, people killed off the local wolves and other large carnivores in the northeast. With the apex predator niche now left open, over the same time frame that humans expanded westward, coyotes expanded to the east, traveling north through Ontario, where they interbred with gray wolves, and later, dogs. This means that the coyotes that are making appearances in New York are in fact a different subspecies called the coywolf. “There’s always this pool of roaming wanderers looking for an opening,” Nagy explained. As young coyotes go out to find a slice of land they can call their own, they go from the forest to the suburbs, from the suburbs to the city parks, and then, before you know it, you start to catch glimpses of them scurrying downtown. For most of their existence coyotes have been the underdog, which has only made them more resilient, earning them a reputation for being crafty and versatile. “Their entire evolutionary history has been under the tooth of wolves, and then under the poison and bullets of people,” Nagy said. “They’re super smart, super adaptable, and they can figure out a way to make it work.” Of course, not everyone appreciates the animals as much as Nagy does. “People will say to me, ‘they don’t belong here,’” he said. “And I’m like, ‘According to who?’ The coyotes are here."" Even though researchers stress that coyotes present minimal threat to people—and even possibly provide some benefits, by keeping rodent, deer, and goose populations in check—some suburban residents have asked for tighter coyote management, because of worries about theirpets becoming coyote chowor suffering a rabid bite. And then there’s the fact that the USDAkills thousandsof the animals a year, to protect ranchers’ interests. But Jonathan Way, author ofSuburban Howls, points out that the past 150 years during which most humans haven’t lived side-by-side with predators is the anomaly. We’re just not used to it because we haven’t seen it in our short lifetimes. “But it’s not the norm, and it’s not going to stay that way,” Nagy said. “If you want to manage it, it’s kind of like putting your finger in the dike,” Nagy continued. “The resources you’d have to deploy to eliminate coyotes from suburbia—and to keep the populations of raccoons and small mammals down—it’s impossible.” For now, New York City wildlife officials have taken the stance that it iswewho need to adapt tothemby following simple common-sense measures like keeping an eye out for our pets and not approaching the coyotes, which are, after all, wild animals. Anyway, if we tried to prevent them from living among us, the coyotes would likely just find another way in. They have proven themselves to be a rather wily bunch."

Most building standards rely on a model of thermal comfort developed in the 1960s that uses clothing insulation and metabolic rates to calculate what temperatures will make people uncomfortable. The problem is, the metabolic rate system used is based on the resting metabolic rate of a single middle-aged man, even though metabolism changes with age, sex, and body size. That rate may overestimate women’s intrinsic heat production by as much as 35 percent, according to the study by researchers at the Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Women typically havelower resting metabolic ratesthan men, meaning that when women are sitting around an office, their body isn’t producing as much heat as a man’s body would. This affects not just women, but everyone in the office, since HVAC systems are calibrated to take into account the heat generated by people being in a room together giving off body heat (that’s why an empty conference room generally is much colder than a crowded one). Reconfiguring thermal standards for offices to take into account the fact that the workforce is no longer largelymalewill not just lead to greater comfort for half the population, it’ll also lead to greater energy savings and more efficient buildings, reducing the amount of energy wasted when offices are refrigerated to Arctic conditions during the summer. We could finally start leaving our thick office sweaters home on sweltering days."

Since 2005, the state’s orange trees have been dying off at a precipitous rate. AsCNN's Moni Basureports, the trees face a small yet insidious foe: a bug called the Asian citrus psyllid, which feeds on their leaves and stems. The bug carries a bacterial disease called citrus greening disease, known ashuanglingbingin Chinese, that causes the trees to produce bitter, misshapen fruit. The disease spreads quickly—too quickly for researchers to find a cure. Florida provides59 percentof America’s oranges. What steps can growers take to save their trees, and the$10 billion industry? Some growers use organic treatments to keep the bugs at bay, Basu writes. Others toy with the idea of using genetically modified strains of citrus. Scientists have stepped in, and they’ve tried bactericides and heat therapy, and have attempted to breed disease-tolerant trees that can bear fruit even while infected. Meanwhile, the future of citrus might lie dormant in the seed bank at theNational Center for Genetic Resources Preservationin Fort Collins, Colorado. There, geneticists preserve seeds, graftable buds, and semen from hundreds of thousands of animal and plant species that are important to agriculture—including citrus trees. At the Center—which is designed to withstand natural disasters and terrorist assaults—plant physiologists freeze tiny bits cut from the plant’s tips in liquid nitrogen. Protected from bacteria, pests, and other ravages, these tips can later be unfrozen and grafted on to rootstock to grow new trees. This way, if citrus greening does conquer America’s orange crops, growers can start again from scratch. Could seed banks save orange trees and other threatened food sources? Thejury's still out, but it still looks to be the last-case scenario when all other ideas fail. Seed banks could help researchers ""conserve materials before they are lost forever,"" plant physiologist Gayle Volk tells CNN. Makes you value your morning glass of O.J. a little more, huh?"
693,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66656/5-itchy-facts-about-fleas,,"The flea siege began in March. First, I found a trail of angry welts up my foot. Then small dark dots appeared on my white sock, only to leap off when inspected more closely. After spraying and vacuuming in the house, we realized the bugs were in our yard, lurking under theagapanthus, leaping out from behind the trash bins to attack us. Why? We have no pets, and only the occasional possum or raccoon waddling through the yard. Better question: How do we get rid of them? “‘Rogue fleas,’ as I call them, are more difficult,” says Jerry Schappert, a pest control expert in Ocala, Fla. who runsThe Bug Doctor. “Dogs run along fences, sleep under or in dog houses, so target areas are predictable. Raccoons, squirrels, etc. aren't usually so bound.” There’s a gap in the research in such situations, because the most effective flea control targets the host animal, saysMichael Rust, an entomologist at the University of California, Riverside. Rust has studied fleas for almost 40 years, and says he has gotten quite a few calls from both individuals and institutions about outdoor infestations, including an elementary school whose grounds were plagued by fleas from feral cats. So, what to do? Here's what I learned about these hardy, hard-to-kill parasites. There are several thousand species of fleas all over the globe, and more than 300just in the continental United States. Fleas tend to feed on mammals, but there are also bird fleas. The most common is the cat flea, orCtenocephalidesfelis, which also feeds on dogs, wildlife, and humans. Fleas eat multiple meals a day, which is why they leave a trail of bites on their host. Female fleas tend to be larger than male fleas. They can lay up to 40 eggs a day and 2000 in a lifetime, which usually lasts a few months. A flea will go from larva to adult in just a few weeks, less time if the weather is hot and humid. Fleas don’t prefer one human over another. Some people are just allergic to the anticoagulant fleas inject before feeding. In fact, humans are not a preferred host, because they have no fur to lay eggs in, Rust says. There is no proven human flea repellent. Deet, which is effective on mosquitoes, doesn’t seem to work, nor is there evidence that eating garlic helps, according to Rust. And no, they aren't drawn by the color white—though there may be something to them being drawn to yellow-green shades, which is why that hue is used in bulbs in flea traps (which have gotten mixed reviews). Fleas are usually attracted to movement, not color, so wearing dark clothing doesn’t fool them. It just makes them harder to see, Rust says. One upside to climate change: fleas don't like it, at least in cases of extended droughts. Flea larvae, according to Rust, are susceptible to drying out. And speaking of desiccants—diatomaceous earth, often touted as good for killing fleas, is not “super effective,” Rust says. This video won't help get rid of my flea problem, but it will distract me while I scratch. The Aztecs in Mexico included fleas in theirsculpture bestiaries, and several centuries later, their descendants started a folk art calledpulgas vestidas, which is literally dead fleas dressed in tiny costumes, with brides and grooms and mariachis (complete with instruments) as favored themes. No one quite knows how this started, but bored nuns in convents have been blamed. Flea circuseswere also quite popular in Europe for a few centuries, and took advantage of the insect’s jumping skills—they can go up to 7 inches, or about 100 times their height—by attaching wires to their legs and making them look like they were pulling things.Maria Fernanda Cardosotoured the world with a flea circus in the 1990s, and her act featured flea “ballerinas.” Pets everywhere got a big break in the mid-'90s, when researchers discoveredimidacloprid, the active ingredient in the popular topical treatment Advantage. A synthetic mimic of highly toxic nicotine, imidacloprid targets the flea’s nervous system, preventing nerves from sending signals to each other, paralyzing and eventually killing the flea. It is now the most popular pesticide in the world, but may play a role in bee colony collapse, especially in conjunction withother triggers. Before imidacloprid,pyrethrins(and pyrethroid, its synthetically made cousin) was the pesticide of choice for dog flea collars and shampoos; certain versions are lethal to cats. Found naturally in chrysanthemums, pyrethrins also affect the flea's nervous system, but some flea populations have started showing resistance. So when it comes to ridding our yard of fleas, what should I do? When you don’t have a host animal, tackling an infestation is tricky, Schappert says. Using a pyrethroid is a must, but so is dousing the yard with insect growth regulator (IGR)—also known as flea birth control. “I'd treat the whole yard and areas [with a pyrethroid] but then use a hand held pump sprayer with IGR,” Schappert says. IGR breaks down quickly when exposed to light, but by using it I'll have ""at least broken down some life cycle and killed many adults.” Hopefully that will work—at least until the next raccoon stops by."
694,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66727/how-shakespeare-changed-americas-wildlife,,"In the opening act ofHenry IV: Part One, the eponymous king refuses to help free Lord Mortimer, the brother-in-law of his loyal knight Hotspur, from imprisonment, and even forbids Hotspur from mentioning Mortimer’s name in his presence. As revenge, Hotspur plots to “find him [the king] when he lies asleep, And in his ear … holla, ‘Moritimer,’” beforechanging his mind and decidingthat, “Nay, I’ll have a starling … taught to speak nothing but ‘Mortimer,’ and give it to him to keep his anger still in motion.” It’s a strange plan, but it’s not as strange as the plan it inspired almost 300 years later, hatched by an eccentric New York businessman named Eugene Schieffelin. Schieffelin was a pharmacist and drug manufacturer by trade, who also had a longstanding interest in wildlife and zoology. In the mid-1870s, he joined the New York chapter of an organization called the American Acclimatization Society. Founded in 1871, the Society sought to introduce European and Asian flora and fauna to the United States for various cultural, aesthetic, and economic reasons. Schieffelin became its chairman in 1877, and in the same year oversaw a meeting in New York in which it was proposed thatevery single species of bird mentioned in the works of Shakespeareshould be imported and introduced to the city, so as to “contribute to the beauty” of Central Park. And, in light of Hotspur’s bizarre idea to troll the King of England inHenry IV: Part One, Schieffelin’s list includedthe European starling. Admittedly, a handful of similar attempts to introduce foreign birds to America had already been made by the time of Schieffelin’s idea. Some—mostnotably the house sparrow—had thrived, while others—such as the skylark, the song thrush, and the bullfinch—had faltered, and their highly localized populations remained low. Even an earlier effort to bring the starling to U.S. in 1876 didn't take as the American Acclimatization Society had hoped. The second attempt, however, outdid everyone’s expectations. Schieffelin began by releasing 60 starlings into Central Park in 1890. Concerned that their population was failing, the following year he released another 40 individuals, and soon their numbers began to swell. News of the first breeding pair, spottedon the eaves of New York’s American Museum of Natural History, was widely celebrated across the city, but for the first six years the birds refused to spread beyond Manhattan. Once they did, however, their population flourished. The starlings’ characteristically hardy and adaptable nature, and their willingness to eat practically any food available, allowed them to make the most of all environments they encountered. Within just 30 years, they had extended their range south as far as Florida, and inland as far as the Mississippi; by 1942, they had reached the West Coast; they quickly spread north into Canada, and eventually reached Alaska; and today they can even be found all alongthe Mexican border. By the 1950s, it was estimated that there were around 50 million individual starlings in America, but despite attempts to poison them, electrocute them, glue them, grease them, andeven coat them in itching powder, today that number is closer to 200 million—all descended from Schieffelin’s original flock of 100 birds. Predictably, the starling’s introduction to America and the subsequent explosion in its population was not without its consequences. Native species that now faced new and unexpectedly voracious competition from the starlings for food and nest sites suffered as a result, and, while the starlings thrived, the native birds' populations collapsed. Today, the starling is still widely considered an invasive and highly destructive pest all across America—and all because of a single line of text, written by Shakespeare more than four centuries ago."

Sure, they’re lighter than they used to be, can now be opened with the press of a button, and are available in a wide variety of colors and patterns, but they're still a pain to open and close from inside a car, and they still drip water all over the floor. KAZbrella, a new umbrella designed by aeronautical engineer Jenan Kazim, is changing all that: It combats all of your typical umbrella woes while maintaining the umbrella’s classic shape. The KAZbrella opens inside out—think of a flower’s petals blossoming—and closes in on itself, keeping the wet surface on the inside and preventing water from pooling up around it. This also makes it easier to open and close within confined spaces, letting you stay dry until the last second (or avoid poking out someone's eye on the street). Perhaps its greatest feature is a button that restores the umbrella’s shape if the wind blows it inside out. No more throwing out umbrellas mid storm! Kazim spent 10 years developing the KAZbrella, which has been more than fully funded onKickstarter. There’s still time to back the campaign; pledges of at least $53 get you your very own KAZbrella."
696,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/54577/guide-pooping-galapagos-islands,,"Galápagos National Park is an ecological treasure trove, a biological hoard guarded fiercely by conservationists. Visitors to the islands must abide bythe park’s rules, which include not taking anything from the wilderness—or leaving anything behind. The park is prized for both its mind-boggling biodiversity and its historical significance, for it was on those desolate, craggy shores and in those primeval forests that a young Charles Darwin observed and collected the unique plants and animals that would inspire his theory of evolution. The archipelago, mused the naturalist in his journal, “seems to be a little world in itself.” Darwin’s research there transformed the islands into an object of scientific and cultural fascination, as well as a bucket-list destination. In 1978, UNESCO honored the archipelago and its living treasures by naming it the first-ever World Heritage site. Ninety-seven percent of the islands’ area was designated a national park; the remaining 3 percent was set aside for human habitation. The parklands and their inhabitants are truly wild, offering no shelter, no Internet access, and no bathrooms. Which raises the question: How do you poop in the Galápagos Islands? You’ve got a few options, none of them luxurious. According to naturalist guide Fabian Bucheli, if a park tourist has an urgent need to go, he or she will be told to hold it (island visits last a maximum of four hours), or directed back to the tour boat or toward one of the islands’ few inhabited areas. Leaving isn’t always possible, however, and Bucheli admitted that in some cases he and other guides will simply “dig a hole and cover the sample.” That moment when the crap hits the sand is actually where things get interesting. Human poop contains millions of unique bacteria, not to mention the remains of non-native plants and animals. Our waste takes more than a year to biodegrade, and in that time a single human “deposit” has the potential to shift the future of entire ecosystems. “Whatever you eat, whatever is inside you, you introduce,"" says Chuck Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona who also answers to “Dr. Germ.” Our fecal bacteria, he says, are a force to be reckoned with. The human gut has been described as“the densest bacterial ecosystem known in nature.”Of all the bacterial warriors in our bellies, Dr. Gerba believes that three in particular could cause problems in the Galápagos:Campylobacter, which can infect birds;Salmonella, which can infect reptiles and amphibians; andE. coli, which can infect just about everything. When a disease passes from a non-human animal to a human, it’s known as zoonosis. Some of the most dreaded diseases in human history—anthrax, cholera, plague, and HIV/AIDS, for example—result from zoonotic infections. The reverse situation, in which human beings transmit disease to non-human animals, is far less considered. The field of reverse zoonosis is a young one, according to Dr. Gerba. “Everybody’s always worried about wildlife infecting us,” he says. “They never think about it the other way around.” Whether we’re worried about it or not, it’s already happening. A2012 studydiscovered that some land and marine iguanas and the islands’ famed giant tortoises harbored antibiotic-resistantE. coliandSalmonellabacteria. The affected populations had only one thing in common: proximity to human settlements or tourist sites. Years of isolation have rendered the park’s flora and fauna vulnerable to any disease we bring in from the outside world. There’s also the issue of plants. For thousands of years, the immobile plant kingdom has relied upon the legs and wings of animals for dissemination. Birds, bears, and humans eat the plant’s ripe fruit and poop out the indigestible seeds, carrying the plant’s genes farther than they could have gone alone. Could plant matter in human feces introduce entirely new plant species to the Galápagos? It’s “a distinct possibility,” says Stephen Walsh, a professor of geography and the director of UNC’s Center for Galápagos Studies. “What has kept the islands so unique all these years is their isolation. But they are isolated no more, and the human imprint is dramatic.” Poop problems are not unique to the Galápagos. To protect high-traffic wildlands and prevent the spread of human diseases, some U.S. parks nowrequire hikers and campers to “pack out” their own wastein plastic bags. (Needless to say, these new regulations have not been enthusiastically embraced by park regulars.) Other parks have set up authorized toilet sites, which are emptied by unfortunate staffers on a regular basis. The toilet issue even has its own Lorax. Conservationist and activist Kathleen Meyer has devoted her life to exploring and protecting our planet, but she’s best known as the author of the international bestsellerHow to Shit in the Woods: An Environmentally Sound Approach to a Lost Art.Meyers is a strong proponent of “packing it out,” whether that means using a portable commode, a double-bagging system, or her own “Shhh!-it Kit,” which is still in its prototype phase. Meyer’s methods are not without their detractors.If an iguana can turn a beach into a bathroom,the skeptics want to know,then why can’t we?One word: airplanes. The crucial difference between our poop and an iguana’s, says Meyer, is range. Other animals have limited territories, but we humans can fly around the world, bringing all our little nasties with us. The same isolation that makes the Galápagos Islands a desirable vacation spot transforms them into a volatile hub of international microbe activity. The bottom line (no pun intended): when we set foot on islands like the Galápagos, we set in motion a chain of events that we cannot control. Our bodies are portable universes, teeming with galaxies of germs and tiny, strange creatures that Darwin would have loved to see."

698,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/52446/parrot’s-first-flight,,"In the latest issue of the print magazine, I have a story about the kakapo, a cartoonishly cute species of parrot that looks like a parakeet crossed with an owl crossed with a Muppet. (You can read ithere.) Kakapos are squat, chubby and flightless, and build their nests on the ground and in the open. They’re also nocturnal, and feel their way through the dark forests with patches of whisker-like feathers on their faces. The whole while, they give off a strong, musty scent that’s impossible to ignore. All of this made them easy pickings for human hunters, plus the dogs, cats, rats, and other predators that humans introduced the to the parrot's home in New Zealand. In just a few centuries, one of the country’s most common birds soon disappeared from the main islands, and today there are only 126 kakapo left in carefully monitored, predator-free communities on the smaller islands. A handful of the birds were transferred to an island that is also, conveniently, one of the last remaining refuges of the Hades flower, an endangered plant that scientists only recently realized had strong ecological ties to the bird. I couldn’t get into too much detail about the transfer operation itself because of space constraints, so here’s the story of how a flightless bird finally took to the skies. In the early morning hours one April day last year, parrot wranglers from the New Zealand Department of Conservation’s Kakapo Recovery Team (KRT) captured seven of the birds on Codfish and Anchor Islands by hand (all 126 remaining kakapo wear radio transmitters, so they’re easy to find) and placed them into individual pet carriers. Their destination:Hauturu, the “resting place of lingering breezes.” Called Little Barrier Island in English, Hauturu had been home to a group of kakapo (Strigops habroptilus) in the early 1980s, but the birds had to be removed after the discovery of accidentally-introducedkiore, or Polynesian rats. With the island’s rats eradicated, the KRT hoped that Hauturu would now be safe for kakapo eggs and chicks, and a suitable place for a large, unmanaged kakapo population. On paper, it’s one of the last New Zealand islands where the birds could live without constant human babysitting. It’s big enough for the birds to live and breed there, and outside of the swimming range of rats, stoats, and other predators living on the other islands. After the kakapo were snatched up, they were taken by helicopter to the large South Island. There, they were loaded on an airplane and taken to North Island. At the Auckland airport, they were put on another helicopter and taken to Hauturu, where they were released from their carriers. That might sound stressful, but kakapo didn’t seem to mind. “Kakapo appear to be hardy travelers and the main risk is heat stress,” Kakapo Recovery Program Manager Deidre Vercoe Scott said. The birds just needed to be kept cool and comfortable with some damp towels in their crates and some apples and carrots to snack on. “This was one of the most complex transfers we have done simply because of the distance the birds had to travel,” Vercoe Scott said. “But with careful planning we were able to achieve it within a day, meaning the birds were not disturbed during their normal active period during the night.” A few months after they arrived, the birds were captured again so KRT members could see how they were adjusting to their new digs. On the whole, Vercoe Scott said, they had settled in well and were in good health. A few of the birds had been part of the island’s previous kakapo population and seemed to have no problems coming back home again. One bird, after a 14 year absence, was able to find her old nesting sites and home range within a week of returning. Sounds like a happy ending, but this is just the beginning of the kakapo’s adventures on Hauturu. The birds didn’t breed last year, and the KRT wasn’t expecting them to, so soon after transfer. This year might be different, and December through February, their human guardians will keep a close eye on them to “see whether or not they are keen,” said Vercoe Scott. These birds aren’t expected to establish a population on the island just yet, though, so there’s no pressure for romance. Rather, they’re pioneers and guinea pigs testing the suitability of Hauturu as a long-term, unmanaged home. Their service to their species could last as long as 10 years, giving conservationists enough data on breeding success to make the call on whether the birds will return to where they came from or be joined by waves of new settlers, and allowed to live alone and in peace on the little island where lingering breezes rest."

But when you gotta go, you gotta go. Image courtesy of IStock. In 1923, Southern California Edison had a problem. After having tapped into hydroelectric dams in the Sierra Nevada to serve their power-hungry Los Angeles customers with 220,000 volts, the company began receiving reports of short circuits and resulting power interruptions. Finding the source of the issue would be no easy feat: The cables connecting the dams to the city stretched for 241 miles—at the time, the world’s longest—and the problem could be anywhere along the way. Edison employees huddled for a solution, speculating on everything from lightning storms to spider webs holding moisture. Months passed with no plausible reason for the outages. A planned upgrade was in danger of being canceled. Big Creek, the site of the dams, had done everything it could to rearrange nature to suit its needs: forests were altered, clouds seeded. Everything seemed to be in order. Eventually, an explanation was within sight: one worker noticed an eagle surveying the land from the top of a transmission tower. The majestic creature took off, soaring into the sky—and leaving a less-than-majestic trail of poop in its wake. This bird had plenty of friends. It turned out that flocks of birds producing ""voluminous streams of bird excrement"" were to blame for the power outages. Etienne Benson, P.h.D., a University of Pennsylvania professor, recently examined this fecal mystery in a paper [PDF] for theEnvironmental Humanitiesjournal. Drawing upon the work of engineer Harold Michener and the power company's archives, Benson discovered accounts of the poo conducting electricity from the wires, overloading capacity, and creating flashovers, which diverted power to the steel towers and into the ground. The feces didn’t even need to touch the wires to pass along electricity. And because the energy essentially destroyed the droppings, the birds left no evidence of their dastardly doo doo. It was the perfect crime. Once Edison determined the problem was excrement, they had to find a way to address it. Fortunately, among Edison’s employees tasked with a solution was the engineer Michener, who also happened to be an amateur ornithologist. The company first installed relays that took some of the load off areas that were used for avian toilet trips, then installed bird guards to prevent vulnerable areas. The birds, however, would not be so easily dissuaded. They just moved to the next closest perch; because of wind, their poop had a reach farther than Edison had anticipated. Unable to deter the birds from landing, the company next installed excrement pans to catch the feces before it landed on the power line. When that didn’t prove entirely successful, three-inch iron “teeth” were placed on crossbeams, making landing a painful proposition for the birds. The combination of poop-catch pans and unwelcoming spikes finally brought down the number of flashovers—and killed all the other competing theories for the cause of the problems. As Benson writes: “That is, it was not some mysterious and spectacular new electrical phenomena, as yet undiscovered by scientists, that was to blame for the flashovers, but rather something far more mundane: bird [poop].” [h/tScience Daily]"

Here are seven lesser-known natural assassins that may be lurking in your life. These plants are popular patio decorations in warmer regions of America. It's a beautiful plant during all stages of its bloom, at the end of which the bean (actually a seed) becomes a vibrant prickly flower.

A lethal dose for humans is four to six seeds, which, unless treated, brings on a very slow and painful death (burning sensation in mouth and throat, abdominal pain, purging, and bloody diarrhea). If hell were made up of one particular rock, it would probably be Hutchinsonite. Discovered by Arthur Hutchinson in 1904, Hutchinsonite is a mixture of sulphur, thallium, lead, and arsenic. Three of those four minerals are lethal to humans, and the fourth one, sulphur, isn't terribly pleasant either.Mindat, the largest mineral database on the internet, warns emphatically, ""Avoid inhaling dust when handling or breaking.

It then begins to bite, producing a neurotoxic venom for which there is no anti-venom. Each octopus carries enough venom to kill 26 humans. The bites are tiny, and sometimes a diver might not even know he was bitten... until his heart stops and his lungs are paralyzed. The poison hemlock family of plants includes some clever little killers. Hemlock has mastered the art of disguise. It is one of many wild ""carrot"" plants, most of which are harmless and often edible. It looks a lot like the harmless Queen Anne's lace, but hemlock will paralyze your respiratory muscles and kill you from lack of oxygen. Would you bet your life on which is which? In certain parts of southwestern America, even the dirt is trying to kill you. Well, not actually the dirt, but a fungus, calledCoccidioidesimmitus,that lives in the dirt. This fungus is easily kicked up and made airborne, from construction, farming, wind, and earthquakes. When inhaled, the fungus produces an illness called cocci, or ""valley fever."" The good news is only about 5 percent of people infected with cocci actually develop the disease. But it can get ugly when they do. Without treatment, cocci can spread throughout the body, devouring everything it touches. It can cause skin ulcers,abscesses, bone lesions, severely swollen joints, heart inflammation,urinary tractproblems, andmeningitis, which can lead to death. Zoanthids are tiny little marine animals that like to live on coral and rocks. They live comfortably in some home aquariums and occasionally accumulate in seafood as well. And they are absolutely teeming with palytoxin, one of the more deadly poisons known to man. Should a person eat seafood that has ingested too many zoanthids, scrape an open wound across a zoanthid, or,as in one peculiar case, inhale palytoxin while trying to clean their aquarium, horrible things can happen. He will experience rhabdomyolysis. This means his skeletal muscles break down and the content of his cells will leak into the blood. The body begins, quite quickly, to suffer nearly every imaginable effect of poisoning, from kidney failure to prickling, burning skin. The cause behind most palytoxin death is heart failure. Some people call it sewer gas; some just call it stink damp. When organic material decomposes (in sewers, swamps, or natural fertilizers) under the right conditions, it can produce a lethal gas called hydrogen sulfide. It is also produced when some sulfide minerals (like those lining the walls of natural wells and springs) are mixed with water. When this gas is released into the air, it can kill a person before he draws in his second breath of it. Even the natural warning, the rotten egg smell of sulphur, can't be counted on as hydrogen sulfide deadens the sense of smell. Not to mention it is also corrosive, flammable, and highly explosive. The good news is low exposure does little harm. The bad news is high exposure cancome with little warning.

While researching that post, I learned that it's not just humans that alter spiders’ behavior with chemicals. There’s a wasp in Costa Rica thatdoes the same thing, in a more gruesome and sinister way, as part of its journey to adulthood. The tropical wasp speciesHymenoepimecis argyraphagais a parasite, and it takes advantage of an unlikely host. The web of the orb weaver spiderPlesiometa argyrais normally a place where bugs meet their untimely death and become spider snacks. Using an arsenal of toxins and mind-altering chemicals, though,H. argyraphagais able to turn the spider into a slave and a meal, and its web into a safe haven. When the female wasp is ready to lay her egg, she seeks out a spider to help raise her child. She stings the spider to paralyze it and then lays an egg on its abdomen. Soon, the egg hatches and the larva that emerges remains attached to the spider, living on its abdomen and suckinghemolymph(kind of the arthropod version of blood) from its body for nourishment. After a few weeks like this, during which the spider goes about its life as normal, the wasp larva is ready to move on to the next stage of its life cycle. To do this, it needs to make a cocoon. A spider’s web is a decent place to build one, but not perfect. It’s suspended above the ground and the sticky threads provide defense from predators that might eat the wasp, but it’s far too flimsy to support the heavy cocoon and the adult wasp that will come out of it. The wasp gets around this problem by forcing the spider to build a web that suits its needs. It injects a chemical (which hasn’t been identified yet) into the spider that alters the host’s behavior. The spider begins building its web as normal, but instead of completing all the steps and getting a carefully-patterned web, the zombified spider simply repeats the first few steps over and over again, resulting in a web that’s just a few heavily-reinforced anchor threads and a small center section. Once the web is done, the spider crawls to the center of the web and sits there complacently. The larva molts, kills the only companion it has ever known, sucks any remaining useful bits out from its corpse, and discards it. Then, it builds its cocoon on a web custom-built for the job. A few weeks later, the adult wasp emerges and flies away, and the cycle starts over. For more on parasitic wasps, see any of Carl Zimmer’spaeansto the Emerald Cockroach Wasp."
704,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/63240/8-surprising-facts-and-misconceptions-about-recycling,,"If you pat yourself on the back for just remembering to separate the recycling or haul that big blue bin to the curb each week, you're not alone. Despite the strides we appear to be making toward eco-consciousness as a country, we have a long way to go in helping the Earth, as evidenced by our complicated relationship with recycling. These facts about the most prevalent of the threeRs will make you pause the next time you throwanythingaway. Figuresfrom the Environmental Protection Agency show that America recycles about 34.7 percent of the garbage it produces. (The world's top recyclers—Germany, Austria, Wales, and South Korea—report a rate between 52 and 56 percent.) But Mitch Hedlund, founder and Executive Director of the organizationRecycle Across Americaisn't even sure the recycling rate often quoted is accurate because there is so much junk mixed in with actual recyclables. Recycle Across America is currently working to encourage the use of standardized labels for recycling bins to eliminate theconfusionover what actually belongs in these receptacles. ""If the U.S. gets the recycling number up to 75 percent, which we believe is completely possible once the confusion (over what to place in the bins) is removed, it will be the CO2 equivalent of removing 50 million cars from the roads each year in the U.S. and it will create 1.5 million permanent new jobs in the U.S. (net)."" While Hedlund admits the idea of providing universal labels clearly stating what should be placed in the bins is a simple one, it's making a serious impact on those who have jumped on the bandwagon. ""Many schools are seeing dramatic increases in their recycling levels since using the society-wide standardized labels on their recycling bins,"" she says. ""For instance, in the pilot program at Culver City schools in Los Angeles [County], their recycling levels doubled when they started using the standardized labels and the materials they were collecting in their recycling bins were so much less contaminated with garbage."" Another story, she says, is that ""as a result of a donation from Kiehls (who makes a donation to Recycle Across America each April in the sum of $50,000), all of the schools in the San Diego Unified School District and San Diego County started using the standardized labels. San Diego Unified School District reduced their landfill hauling fees by about $200,000 (net) in the first year."" Until 2018, China took40 percentof the United States's recycled paper, plastic, and metal. But in January of that year, China imposed strict new rules on the levels of contamination (think food or other garbage mixed in with the recyclables) it's willing to accept—standards American cities are largely unable to meet. Because of that, and a lack of suitable destinations closer to home, many cities have been forced toincinerateorstockpilerecyclables until they can find a better solution. The nation recycles less than 10 percent of its plastic,compared to67 percent for paper materials, 34 percent for metals, and 26 percent for glass. And China's restrictions have especially affected plastic—while exports of scrap plastic to China were valued at more than $300 millionin 2015, they amounted to $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, down 90 percent from the year before. Unfortunately, most curbside haulers don't accept textiles, and America has a serious problem with old clothes ending up in the trash. In 2019, the nation is on track to throw away more than35 billionpounds of textiles, according to the Council for Textile Recycling—almost double the number from 1999. On the plus side, some cities have set up drop-off points for unwanted clothes, and there are a variety ofwaysto sell or donate unwanted items. Some brands, including Eileen Fisher and Patagonia, have also introduced buy-back programs for their items. Nearly 70 percent of aluminum cans are recycled internationally, according to Novelis, a leader in rolled aluminum products and recycled aluminum. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable without degrading, meaning it can be reused in a way completely different from what it was in its previous life, or recast into its original form. Not only is aluminum the world's most-recycled product, it's also themost profitableand the most energy-efficient. Using recycled aluminum instead of virgin materials saves about 95% of the energy, compared to 60% for paper and 34% for glass [PDF]. According to Novelis's research, an aluminum can that is recycled can be back on a grocery store shelf within 60 days [PDF]. That's a seriously speedy turnaround. While the words scrap recycling might have you humming theSanford & Sontheme song, it's far from being a junkyard industry. According to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI), in 2017 U.S. scrap recyclers processed more than 130 million tons of scrap metal, paper, plastic, glass, textiles, and more—material that was sold back to industrial consumers in the U.S. and around the world, generating close to $18 billion in export sales. All told, scrap recycling was a $117 billion industry in 2017 [PDF]. This list first ran in 2015 and was updated by Mental Floss staff in 2019."

A new study of 16 years of billing records from a South Carolina electric company suggests that people who use automatic payments end up consuming more power. Around half of households with Internet access in the U.S. pay bills by autopay, according to a2013 survey. However, by eliminating the step of engaging with monthly bills in the process of writing out a check, automatic payments may allow people to ignore the cost of what they're using, and in doing so, spend more without realizing it, according to thestudyby Duke University economist Steven Sexton in theReview of Economics and Statistics. Sexton examined years of records fromSantee Cooper, a South Carolina power company that serves about 160,000 customers, including bills for both residential and commercial accounts. Households that enrolled in automatic billing showed a 4 to 6 percent increase in electricity consumption, on average, and commercial customers consumed an average of 8 percent more electricity. Granted, this study only examined the effects of autopay on one utility in one region, and it’s possible that results might differ across the entire country, or for other utility usages, such as water consumption. But if the results hold true nationwide, at least with electricity use, autopaying could increase U.S. power consumption by 15.8 billion kilowatt hours per year—about the equivalent of the electricity use of 1.5 million homes. So much for the environmentalism of paper-free billing."
706,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/52262/desert-maine,,"Ahhh . . . Maine! Land of lakes and lighthouses, lobster and blueberries, pine trees and sand dunes. Wait, sand dunes? A miniature desert blankets 40 acres of land just a stone’s throw west of Freeport, Maine. An uncanny contrast with the state’s sweeping trees, the dunes (dubbed the “Desert of Maine”) are a geological curiosity—and Mother Nature’s way of reminding us that if you don’t take care of her, she’ll come after you. About 10,000 years ago, glaciers lurched through what is today southern Maine, grinding soil and rock into glacial silt. As the millennia flew by, topsoil accumulated and caked over the mica-heavy silt, priming the area into first-class farmland. That’s what lured William Tuttle there: In 1797, he bought 300 acres to start up his family farm. Like most Maine-ahs back then, he was clueless about what lurked beneath. Tuttle was a fine farmer. His descendants, though, were not. They failed to rotate the crops and their sheep overgrazed (the same bad habits that sparked the Dust Bowl). When the farm’s topsoil started to erode, a tiny patch of sand—no bigger than a basketball—appeared. It grew, and it spread so much that it gobbled up the family’s farmland. The Desert of Maine was born, and it swallowed so much that some buildings are now buried under eight feet of silt. After a fire forced the Tuttles to call it quits, Henry Goldrup bought the land in 1919. Living the cliché that one man’s trash is another man’s treasure, Goldrup made bank by transforming the desert into a tourist trap, which it remains today. Although it’s technically not a desert (it rains too much) and the wavy hills of sand are really silt, the Tuttles seemingly farmed up their own patch of Death Valley in the Pine Tree State."

FINDER uses microwave-radar technology to detect heartbeats and wasoriginally inventedto identify the existence of life on other planets. On April 29, two prototypes of FINDER were brought to Nepal in order to help find the403 people believed to be missing. Using the portable device, rescue workers were able to detect two sets of heartbeats underneath two different collapsed buildings. They were then able to find and rescue the four men.

708,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62316/11-fascinating-facts-about-beavers,,"Beavers' ability to shape their environment is beyond impressive—but you already knew about the dam building. Let’s look at some other things that make beavers incredible. Although they didn’t have the characteristic flat tail, giant beavers of the Ice Age, in the extinct genusCastoroides, looked remarkably similar to their modern descendants—just much, much bigger. They grew to be up to eight feet long, weighed 200 pounds, and lived a semi-aquatic life. In fact, it’s sometimes used in vanilla flavorings.Castoreumis a chemical compound that mostly comes from a beaver’s castor sacs, which are located under the tail. It is secreted as a brown slime that's about the consistency of molasses and smells like musky vanilla. It’s an FDA-approved natural flavoring. The world’s largest beaver dam stretches for850 metersin the wilderness of northern Alberta. It was discovered after being spotted on a satellite image in 2007, but scientists believe multiple generations of beavers have been working on the dam since the 1970s. In September 2014, explorerRob Markbecame the first person to ever reach the dam. Or at least they'remonogamous. Dams are usually started by a young male looking for love or by a mated-for-life new couple. A wholebeaver familywill live in a single dam—mom, dad, young kids, and yearlings. In 1948, new human inhabitants of western Idaho began to clash with the local beaver population. The Idaho Department of Fish and Game wanted to put these threatened beavers in a nearby protected area, but they didn't know how to get them there. Elmo Heter of Idaho Fish and Game devised an ingenious solution: By using surplus parachutes from World War II, the department coulddrop boxes of beaversdown from planes. After some careful calibrations, 76 beavers made the skydive into the reserve, and all but one survived the fall. This one may sound obvious, but up until the 1100s, peoplethought that beavers did. The myth originated in ancient Egypt and reappeared in the bestiaries of medieval Europe. The story went that beavers knew hunters were after them for the valuable castoreum oil in their testicles. This myth was not terribly difficult to disprove, largely because beaver testicles do not hang outside their bodies. And not because they have terrible dental hygiene. To gnaw through tree trunks, they need extra-strong teeth. Fortunately, their tooth enamelcontains iron, which makes them incredibly strong, sharp, and orange. Because the orange enamel on the front of their teeth wears away more slowly than the white dentin on the back, a beaver’s teeth self-sharpen as it chews on trees. Beavers build dams for myriad reasons, and one is so that the lake behind it will grow deep enough to ensure it doesn’t freeze all the way through during the winter. This bit of temperature control is especially crucial because beavers anchor a food cache to the bottom of the lake to serve as sustenance during the cold months. A beaver’s oversized leathery tail, which can grow up to 15 inches long and six inches wide, has uses both on land and in the water. While swimming, the beaver uses his tail as a rudder or as a siren by slapping it against the water to warn other beavers of a predator. On dry land, the tail acts as a prop to allow the beaver to sit upright or as a counterbalance so he doesn’t tip over while carrying heavy supplies in his teeth. Until recently, the last mention of a beaver sighting in England came in 1789 when a bounty was paid for a beaver head in Yorkshire. By that point, the once-prolific beaver had dwindled due to over-hunting for their valuable pelts and medicinal glands. For a few hundred years, the species disappeared from Great Britain. In the 2010s, conservationists reintroduced a wild population of beavers to a river in Devon and observed how the animals took to their new environment. In 2020, beavers were givenlegal protectionin the UK. This semi-aquatic mammal has physical adaptations that help them navigate the water.Nose and ear valvesshut to keep out water while beavers are submerged, and nictitating membranes (transparent ""third eyelids"") act as goggles.

But monitoring the world's oceans isn't cheap, which is why Andrew Stern and Benjamin Thompson are revolutionizing how scientists and researchers can get the data they need. Stern, a former professor of neurology-turned-environmental advocateand filmmaker, came up with idea to use surfers as a means of collecting information about the ocean’s chemistry. Then he met Benjamin Thompson, a surfer working on his Ph.D. in structural engineering at UC San Diego, who was trying to incorporate sensors into surfboards so users could monitor the boards' performance. The pair decided to collaborate and create a sensor—calledSmartphin—that could do both. ""My intention with this was to use it as a tool to inform people about the environment and specifically the oceans,"" Stern toldOutside Magazine. ""So I made a map with 17 surf spots around the world and said we'll deploy to these places as many sensors as the scientists say we'll need there [to collect] data."" Come November, 50 scientists and researchers from theScripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diegowill begin the Smartphin pilot program and replace their normal fins with the Smartphin prototype. From there, they will compare the data on temperature, salinity, and acidity from their boards with data collected by similar sensors attached to a nearby pier in order to understand how the oceans' chemistries are changing over time, and to predict what could happen to them in the future. Replacing the fins might be a hard sell for surfers who are loyal to their boards, but according toOutside, Thompson “built some extra technology into Smartphin that will compel surfers to use it for their own selfish reasons: To know where and when waves are good and to track their own surfing performance.” [h/tOutside Magazine]"

In 2012, that very same cypress burned to the ground. Known as “The Senator,” this majestic, 118-foot tall tree was one of the oldest organisms in the world. Over the course of its long life, it survived hurricanes, disease, and logging sprees; serving as a landmark for Seminole Indians; a tourist attraction for curiousVictorians; and a spiritual epicenter for pilgrims hoping to bask, literally, in the shade of history. We may have lost ""The Senator,"" but there are still other ancient trees to marvel at. Here are some of the world’s oldest andmost interesting treesthat remain. The world’s oldest known living tree sprouted sometime during the lastIce Age, more than 9550 years ago. This 16-footNorway sprucein the Dalarna province of Sweden may look more like the tree fromA Charlie Brown Christmas, but don’t be fooled: its root system got started back when an ice bridge still connected the British Isles to Europe. Leif Kullman, the geologist who discoveredthe tree, named it after his dead dog. Methuselah, abristlecone pine treefrom California’s White Mountains, is thought to be almost 5000 years old—and the oldest non-clonal tree in the world. Theexact locationof the gnarled, twisted Methuselah is a Forest Service secret for its protection. In 1964, a slightly older tree by the name ofPrometheuswas accidentally felled by a scientist who didn’t realize the tree was as old as it was. Llangernyw, a lush, 4000-year-old yew tree, was inducted into a list of 50 Great British Trees by the UK Tree Council in 2002, which, as far as tree honors are concerned, is a pretty big deal.Llangernywwas planted in what is now a North Wales churchyard way back when theEgyptian Pyramidswere still considered a new development. TheZoroastrian Sarv, a tree in central Iran, is a national natural monument. The 4000-year-old cypress took root right about the time ancient people in Central Asia were inventingwheels with spokes. Fitzroya Cupressoides, a type of tall, skinny evergreen in the Andes Mountains, are some of the oldest trees in the world. Known commonly as theAlerce, many of these soaring evergreens have been logged in the last 200 years, but scientists have been tracking and protecting one specific tree, which is thought to be more than 3600 years old. The Tree of One Hundred Horses, an enormous chestnut near the Mount Etna volcano in Sicily, is thought to be between 2000 and 4000 years old. The inimitable name comes from an old legend where 100 drenched knights and their sopping steeds sought refuge from a thunderstorm beneath its protective branches. It’s almost believable: This truly massive tree holds theworld record for girth, clocking in at 190 feet in circumference—nearly the length of a hockey rink.

That seemingly infinite stuff covering beaches, riverbanks, and deltas around the world is in short supply as global demand increases year by year. Sand is used to make glass, electronics, and aeronautics—but by far its biggest use is in construction. That’s because sand is an essential ingredient in the production of concrete. As cities grow larger and taller—think Dubai, Shanghai, and Mumbai—they use increasing amounts of sand to build skyscrapers, sidewalks, and all the other infrastructure that supports growth. U.S. Geological Survey figuressuggest sand and gravel use in construction alone accounts for about 30 billion tons a year globally. Combined with the sand and gravel used for land reclamation, embankments, concrete roadways, and industry, a conservative estimate for total annual consumption is around 44 billion tons. According to the USGS, China, India, Brazil, the U.S., and Turkey are the world’s biggest concrete producers, with China and India together accounting for two-thirds of total production. But when it comes to sand consumption, there’s no contest: China gobbles the most by far as its megacities expand.

Not really. Desert sand is eroded predominantly by wind rather than water, and as a result it's too fine to be used in most construction materials. Until recently, most construction sand was mined from riverbanks and quarries. But with the dramatic increase in demand, marine and beach sand mining are increasingly common. No matter where it occurs, sand mining has a tremendous impact on the environment. It causes flooding, leads to biodiversity and land loss, damages infrastructure like bridges and embankments, pollutes rivers and groundwater, and destroys beaches. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with sand extraction and transport take a significant toll as well. As sea levels rise and development eats away at beaches, the impact of coastal and marine sand mining will intensify. River mining has already led to the destruction of entire ecosystems. Governments are responding with stronger regulations to monitor and control sand extraction in areas where it is likely to lead to costly environmental or infrastructure consequences. But poorly enforced regulations in developing countries—particularly in parts of Africa and Asia—have created unintended consequences: a thriving black market inillegal sand mining, and sand mafias that exert control through threats, bribes, and violence. Yes, there are sand mafias. Some criminal syndicates deal sand now. So far, no one has come up with a single replacement for natural sand that can keep pace with demand. But together, the alternatives may have some impact. Recycling concrete, quarry dust, and even glass bottles can help reduce demand. Replacing concrete with sustainable materials like straw and recycled materials in home and road construction is another partial solution. Researchers are also developing natural sand alternatives. A team of engineers based in the UK are trying out anew concrete formulain India that replaces some sand with tiny plastic particles. And breakthroughs inself-healing bioconcretesare helping to extend the life of structures that would require a lot more sand to rebuild."

Spanning 2.1 million square miles and nine countries across South America, it’s one of the most biodiverseregionson Earth, with more than 400new animal and plant speciesdiscovered there since 2010. So how many trees make up this massive ecosystem? According toa studyby dozens of biologists and conservationists using statistical models, the Amazon is home to an estimated 390 billion trees and 16,000 diverse tree species. Fauset et al.,Nature Communications These trees play a vital role in the global ecosystem. The Amazon holds up to 17 percent of the world’s terrestrial carbon stores. However, a relatively small fraction of these 16,000 tree species play an outsize role in storing carbon. According to recent research in the journalNature Communications, only 1 percent of Amazonian tree species is responsible for 50 percent of the forest’s carbon storage. Trees’ ability to suck carbon out of the atmosphere makes them animportant shieldagainst further climate change, which is why emission-heavy China recently startedplanting a “Green Great Wall”of trees. China has planted 32 million acres of new forests since 2008, offsetting the carbon storage lost to deforestation in tropical forests like the Amazon, where deforestation rates areon the rise again. Looks like 390 billion-odd trees is not enough."

They’re working on anultrasonic dryerthat vibrates moisture out, instead of evaporating it with heat, making the dryer more efficient and safer to operate. Working with GE, they're developing a prototype that swaps heat for ultrasound vibrations, using five to 10 times less energy than traditional dryers. See it in action in the video below. The vibrating dryer turns the moisture in wet clothes into a cold mist, and eliminates the danger of your clothes shrinking in a hot dryer. The first electric dryer wasreleased in 1938and became a popular fixture in American householdsafter World War II. Now, some85 percentof U.S. households have dryers and spend $9 billion a year to operate them [PDF], according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. By heating clothes in a rotating barrel, tumble dryers are exceedingly inefficient, using two to four times more energy than a new washer (andtwice as muchas European-style heat-pump dryers), and account for almost 6 percent of residential energy consumption [PDF]. These numbers are especially bleak considering there's a completely free, energy-efficient way to dry clothes: on a clothesline. For now, the ultrasonic dryer prototype is small and can only dry scraps of fabric, but the researchers estimate that a full-sized dryer could reduce drying times for a load by15 to 20 minutes. Because of the lack of heat, the dryer also produces less lint, which can be a fire hazard when the lint trap isn't properly cleaned. The researchers expect to have a full working prototype by summer 2016. [h/t:USA Today]"
716,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/63145/mongol-miners-were-extreme-polluters,,"Global Water Forum, Flickr //CC BY 2.0 Nearly one-sixth of the land in China that could be used for farming is polluted by heavy metals. While modern mining and industrial operations share part of the blame, in some parts of the country, the problem has much older roots. Researchers have found that the environmental woes of the southwestern Yunnan province go all the way back to the invading Mongols, who now appear to be some of the region’s early large-scale metal workers and worst polluters. Yunnan has rich deposits of metals like copper, tin, lead, gold, silver, and iron, and a long history of mining and metallurgy. Exactly how long, though, has been unclear, since there’s little archaeological or chemical evidence to help put an age on the area’s early copper working sites. To get a better idea of the timing and scale of Yunnan’s pre-modern metalworking, Aubrey Hillman, a Ph.D. student at the University of Pittsburgh, went to Yunnan in 2009. Instead of looking at the metalworking sites for evidence of their age, she turned to nearby Lake Erhai. Modern day metal pollutants are well documented in the lake, and Hillman figured that older contaminants would have found their way into the waters, too. She and a team of researchers from the U.S. and China dug up cylindrical sections of the lake bed—called core samples—at three different spots in the lake that year, and another five in 2012. They measured the concentrations of a variety of metals—including copper, lead, silver, cadmium, zinc, aluminum, and magnesium—in the cores’ sediment layers and then determined the age of the metals by radiocarbon dating fossilized leaves and charcoal found in the same layers. Theydiscoveredthat one of their cores spanned a period of 4500 years of sediment deposits, and the metals in the different layers tell a fascinating story. From 2500 BCE to 200 CE, the concentrations of lead, silver, cadmium, and zinc were low and stable, representing what the researchers think is the background level of metals that are naturally deposited in the lake by wind, forest fires and volcanic emissions. Beginning at 1500 BCE, copper levels increased while the other metals remained the same, suggesting the beginning of copper-based metalworking around the lake (an idea supported by what archeological evidence there is). From 200 to 450 CE, concentrations double for all of the metals, and increase even more for some of them. The researchers attribute the jump to increased sediment deposits from people tilling the land for agriculture and digging irrigation channels. Around 1100 CE, concentrations of lead, silver, zinc, and cadmium increased again and peaked at 1300 CE, before declining around 1420 CE. This coincides with reign of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, which established a government-operated silver mine in Yunnan in 1290 CE and made nearly half of its tax revenue from taxes on silver production in the province. The Mongol method for extracting silver was hardly clean, and relied on roasting silver-laden rocks in low-temperature furnaces. The concentration of pollutants that wound up in the lake during these years, the researchers say, was high enough to harm its plant and animal life, and was actually three to four times higher than what’s produced by industrialized mining activity today. The large-scale mining and smelting operations not only put metal contaminants into the atmosphere and the lake, but the furnaces required a lot of wood, suggesting the Mongols may have also deforested large swaths of land around the lake. The researchers conclude that Yunnan’s modern pollution issues aren’t entirely modern, but are part of a long history that goes back to the conquering Mongols and even before them. While we might think of the pre-industrial past as a simpler, cleaner time, Hillman says her team’s findings show for the first time that pollution was sometimes greater then than it is today and that “people may have been seriously impacting the environment for much longer than we thought.”"

But even if you know that the resulting illusion carries no deeper meaning, they're still fun to look at. Here are 8 fantastic examples of the phenomenon in nature.

While the chief and his headdress are all natural, humans have added one fitting touch to his appearance—the line that looks like an earbud attached to his ear is actually a road to an oil well. Interestingly, although the image appears to be a small mountain range when viewed on Google, it is actually a valley. This is the only rock formation on this list that you can no longer go see, as the rocks that made up the face of the“Old Man” collapsed in 2003. The illusion, located onCannon Mountain in New Hampshire, was first noted in 1805 and became the state emblem in 1945. Fans of the rock formation are working to create a memorial monument at the base of the mountain. Those who regret not getting to see the Old Man of the Mountain while it was still standing can console themselves by seeing one of themany similar rock formationslocated around the globe. TheApache Head in the Rockslocated in Ebihens, France, is always a great alternative. This one isn’t as clear as many of the others, but with its massive head and eyes paired with a tiny mouth and chin, this face shape in the desert looks a lot like the stereotypical description of alien visitors. Fittingly, this alien head illusion can be found just outside of Area 51 in Nevada, giving conspiracy theorists even more evidence that “they” are among us—even if only in the sand.

The larger the circle, the larger the earthquake. Source:USGS In 1811 and 1812, a series of earthquakes emanated from New Madrid, Missouri, and were felt as far away as Ohio and South Carolina. The soil beneath the Mississippi River rose, temporarily changing its course so that it flowed backward. (The phenomenon is not as rare as you might think; in fact, theMississippi flowed backward earlier this yearthanks to Hurricane Isaac.) The event might have gone relatively unnoticed except that a group of Muskogee people thought the phenomenon was a river god, the Tie Snake, writhing under the ground. The Tie Snake was believed to be an antlered river monster who lurked beneath the water and straddled the divide between the Upper and Lower Worlds—between sky and river, and order and chaos. Muskogee culture focused on communal prosperity, but their traditions had been altered by the infiltration of European trade goods and the new culture that accompanied them. Some Muskogee people believed that the Tie Snake was calling them to return to a traditional lifestyle—and warning them to stop the Europeans from infiltrating their culture. This command might also have gone (relatively) unnoticed, except that a remnant of the Spanish government met some Muskogee warriors in Pensacola, Florida, and gave them weapons. The British had the young American navy tied up off the Atlantic coast in the War of 1812, and the Spanish hoped that the Muskogee men could weaken the Americans from another direction. The Muskogees themselves were divided over the potential for conflict, but before they could reach a consensus, European settlers in the area caught wind of the exchange and ambushed the Muskogee warriors at the Battle of Burnt Corn. The Muskogees retaliated at the Battle of Fort Mims in 1813, and panic flared all the way from the frontier outpost to the paved streets of the new capital. Andrew Jackson charged south, leading a cavalry which chased the Muskogees from the Battle of Talladega to the slaughter at Horseshoe Bend in 1814. The Muskogees were forced to cede a huge portion of their land in the subsequent peace treaty, and Jackson didn’t forget the experience. When he ascended to the presidency, his harsh policies led to the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Throughout the next decade, thousands of Muskogee, Cherokee, Choctaw, Seminole, and Chickasaw people were forced to march from the forests of the Deep South to what is now eastern Oklahoma. The Cherokee people’s journey was the most notorious; of the 15,000 who began the journey, 4000 died along the way. All told, 46,000 Native Americans were removed from their ancestral lands during the forced migrations, in the exodus now remembered as the Trail of Tears.

719,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/31495/john-james-audubons-discovery-bird-might-not-exist,,"Wikimedia Commons “It was in the month of February, 1814, that I obtained the first sight of this noble bird, and never shall I forget the delight which it gave me.” That’s John James Audubon, the American naturalist and artist, writing inThe Birds of America. Audubon is remembered today for creating some of the most spectacular paintings of North American wildlife ever made, identifying 25 new species and a number of sub-species of birds and lending his name to the Audubon Society, an environmental organization dedicated to conservation. His spotting of that noble bird one morning, though, left a blemish on his legacy, stirred up a years-long controversy among ornithologists, and led some people to brand him a liar or a nut. The bird has turned out to be unidentifiable and is rarely reliably reported in the wild. Audubon first saw one on a trip up the Mississippi River with a Canadian fur trader. Both were tired, cold, and miserable when an eagle flew overhead. The trader’s mood changed instantly. ""How fortunate!"" he said. “This is what I could have wished. Look, sir! The Great Eagle, and the only one I have seen since I left the [Great] Lakes.” Audubon leapt to his feet and watched the bird for a few minutes as it circled over their heads. It resembled an immature bald eagle, but he couldn’t identify it and decided it was a species new to him, if not everyone. The fur trader explained that the huge, brown birds were rare, and sometimes followed hunters and trappers in the north to scavenge what they could from a kill. They were also formidable hunters in their own right, diving into the Great Lakes to retrieve fish in their beaks. The behavior didn’t sound like that of either known North American eagle—the bald eagle,Haliaeetus leucocephalus, and the golden eagle,Aquila chrysaetos—and Audubon was convinced that the bird was an undiscovered species. A few years later, he had another encounter with the mystery bird. He was in Kentucky visiting a friend, and walking along a path near a shack where they had slaughtered a hog a few days before. “I saw an Eagle rise from a small enclosure not a hundred yards before me…and alight upon a low tree branching over the road,” wrote Audubon inBirds of America. “I prepared my double-barreled piece, which I constantly carry, and went slowly and cautiously towards him. Quite fearlessly he awaited my approach, looking upon me with undaunted eye. I fired and he fell.” He and his friend examined the bird and acknowledged that neither of them knew what it was. They collected the corpse and brought it back to the house for further study. Audubon made a biological description and a life-size painting of what he dubbedFalcowashingtonii, the bird of Washington or Washington’s eagle, in honor of America’s first president. He said of the connection between the two, “He was brave, so is the Eagle; like it, too, he was the terror of his foes; and his fame, extending from pole to pole, resembles the majestic soarings of the mightiest of the feathered tribe. If America has reason to be proud of her Washington, so has she to be proud of her great Eagle.” According to Audubon’s description and depiction of the bird, it stood 3 feet, 7 inches tall and had a wingspan of 10 feet, 2 inches, making it far bigger than any known North American raptor. Given its size and a few other physical distinctions—among them a uniform scaling on its tarsi (the lower parts of a bird’s legs)—biologists accepted Audubon’s discovery as a legitimate new species and additional sightings, especially in the Great Lakes region, were reported in scientific journals for years after. Soon, though, the tone around Washington’s eagle began to change. In the later years of Audubon’s life, other naturalists began to question whether the bird was really a distinct species. He was accused of taking sloppy measurements of his specimen and overstating the physical differences between his bird and other species. Washington’s eagle, as a species, was quickly discredited among scientists, the consensus being that the bird was either a misidentified bald eagle or a hoax and publicity stunt. Just a few years after Audubon’s death in 1851, the journalAmerican Naturalistcalled it a valid species only among “amateur ornithologists.” What did Audubon see, shoot and make such a big deal out of? Most of his critics suspected it was an exceptionally large northern bald eagle, which are all brown before they reach maturity and lack the distinctive white head the bird is known for. It’s possible that Audubon misidentified it because he was unfamiliar with the species’ development, but he wrote about plenty of encounters with both mature and immature bald eagles and should have been familiar with their changing appearance, and known one when he saw one. There’s also the nagging matter of his eagle’s size and tarsal scaling. If Audubon really did discover an unknown giant North American eagle, science might never be able to confirm it. Ornithologists haven’t reported seeing anything like it in all their years studying raptors since, and reports from the public have turned out to be misidentifications. Only a handful of the birds were ever said to be captured, killed and preserved during Audubon’s day, and everyone one of those supposed specimens is long gone. One that was sent to the Linnean Society of London for safekeepingwas auctioned off and its location is unknown. One at the Peale Museum in Philadelphia was destroyed in a fire. The ones at the New England Museum, the Cleveland Academy of Science and Museum of Natural History in Boston have all been lost and possibly destroyed. Even the specimen that Audubon painted is missing in action. Without a live or stuffed specimen matching Audubon’s description on which to run a DNA analysis, Washington’s eagle remains something of an avian Bigfoot, and maybe just an idea for the birds."

721,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/21021/4-creative-law-enforcement-techniques-national-parks,,"BY BRIAN KEVIN When the Interior Department decided a few months ago to allow loaded, concealed weapons into national parks, heat-packin' groups like the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms hailed the decision as a victory for public safety. They cited, among other things, ""the inability of park officials to provide adequate law enforcement services"" due to slim budgets and staff.Â  But our trigger-happy pals might not be giving the Boys in Green enough credit. Where law enforcement is concerned, national park rangers have historically displayed a consistent knack for doing more with less. Check out these four examples. Of course, that wasn't the only time early rangers relied on the technique. They resorted to similar measures when Basque shepherds were caught illegally grazing on park lands. While the hapless sheepherders got kicked out via the park's north gate, their sheep were graciously escorted east. When Congress formally chartered Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934, the crown jewel of the Eastern parks wasn't exactly a pristine wilderness — in fact, there were still a few hundred people living in it.While many Appalachian residents had accepted buyouts in the years leading up to the park's formation, others were too poor or too stubborn to relocate. What's more, the hundreds of empty cabins tucked away inside the park lured hordes of Depression-era squatters.Park rangers made a mission of evicting the unwelcome guests, but when the wily mountaineers wouldn't stay ejected, they simply began burning down any abandoned or temporarily vacated cabins. Not entirely without empathy, the park's first superintendent J. Ross Eakin noted that preventing squatters by torching ancestral homesteads tended to raise ""considerable ire among residents."" In the mid-1920s, Colorado was a bastion of influence for the Ku Klux Klan-- a state where the governor, the mayor of Denver, and U.S. Senator Rice Means all openly accepted Klan support. After Senator Means made a publicity tour through southwestern Colorado's Mesa Verde National Parkin 1926, local Klansmen sought to convince park superintendent Jesse Nusbaum to grab a white sheet and join the club. When he declined, the Klan showed up with plans to hold a torchlight parade in front of one of the park's most recognized Anasazi ruins.The upright Nusbaum told the Klan they weren't wanted in Mesa Verde, and to show that he meant business, visibly armed the small park staff with pick-ax handles and other improvised weapons. The Klansmen got the message and left the park without incident. The trespassers paid $25 fines, and Sedlack got a stern reprimand, along with the secret admiration of every ranger who's ever wanted to go Scarface on an exhaust-spewing snowmobile.For years, the Montana Wilderness Association even issued a ""Sedlack Award"" for creativity in defense of public lands."
722,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/23122/botany-desire-documentary-tonight-8pm-pbs,,"Update:  the entire documentary is nowavailable online for free! A new PBS* documentary,The Botany of Desire, premieresWednesday night (tonight!) at 8pm on PBS stations throughout the US.  It's based on the popular Michael Pollan book of the same name, and I urge you to carve out two hours (in most markets between 8pm - 10pm) on Wednesday night to watch it.  The program is packed with science, history, and beautiful photography. I've seen the film in advance, and I highly recommend it, particularly if you're interested in any of the four plants featured in it:tulip, marijuana, potato,andapple.  By telling the stories of these plants, Pollan explains how in some ways the plants are manipulating us, rather than the other way around -- in the same way that flowers ""use"" bees to spread their pollen, these plants have ""used"" humans to spread themselves across the planet and out-compete other plants.  One note:  the program may not be suitable for young children, as there is use of the word ""sex"" (as applied to plants) and discussion of marijuana.  It also might be pretty boring for the under-twelve set (despite beautiful flower photography), unless they're thoroughly nerdy. Here's a preview of the documentary: After the jump, I include some notes on each plant discussed in the documentary. Apples arose in Kazakhstan, where bears would eat them and, uh, deposit the seeds as they went.  But when people entered the picture, we began to spread the apple and its sweetness.  Thus, the ""biological strategy"" of apples is to increase their sweetness, causing us to spread them around the globe.  Humans have an innate desire for sweetness -- presumably because in nature, sweetness is rare and generally denotes lots of calories. Although the Bible doesn't specify the fruit that was at the heart of so much trouble in the Garden of Eden, we assume it to be an apple -- even though it was probably a pomegranate due to geographic restrictions on where apples grow best.  Then there's the rather fascinating discussion ofJohnny Appleseed, whose real motivation was to bring alcohol (via hard cider) to pioneers, rather than tasty sweet apples.  (Follow the link for some more info, all snagged from Pollan's book, on the man -- he was surprisingly rich for a dude who wore a tin pot on his head.) Tulips are examples ofangiosperms, or flowering plants.  The rise of the angiosperms brought sex (via flowers and pollen exchange) into the plant picture, and as Pollan says, ""sex creates variation.""  The documentary thoroughly explains the Dutch speculative investment bubble known as Tulip Mania, which made tulips one of the most valuable commodities in the world.  At the height of Tulip Mania, a single tulip bulb sold for the equivalent of what today would be $10-15 million!  Tragically, some of the most prized tulips were made beautiful because of a virus that was slowing killing them -- which caused spectacular striped or ""broken"" flowers, but ultimately killed the plant.  Pollan suggests that the tulip's biological ""strategy"" has been to develop a form of beauty that humans find very appealing, causing us to domesticate and grow it even to the point of financial ruin. I won't say much about this section, as this is a family blog, but I can certainly say that this program treats the topic fairly and doesn't go nuts with it.  There's an interesting discussion of how THC (the main ""active ingredient"") binds to receptors in the human brain that affect the brain's ability to remember and forget -- and Pollan wonders exactly how a plant would find a way to manipulate those human brain receptors in order to make cannabis such a widely-propagated plant today.  It is a curious question, indeed -- how would a plant manage to just ""happen"" to have such a profound effect on humans?  Again, Pollan wonders if this is a biological ""strategy"" in some sense. The documentary includes extensive footage of legal (under state laws, though not federal law) cannabis growing operations -- you get an inside look into how medical marijuana is produced, and it's surprisingly complex.  My favorite line:  in describing how the farmers plant only female cannabis plants so they'll produce more THC-rich resin, Pollan describes the grow room as a room of ""massive sexual frustration"" -- all the female plants are desperately trying to catch some male pollen, producing more and more resin in their efforts. The documentary takes us to South America, showing how the descendants of the Incas are still farming potatoes, and how potatoes traveled from South America to Europe via the Spanish Conquistadores.  The potato was such a hugely productive crop (more food per acre than grain) that it transformed the Old World, enabling the industrial revolution.  There's also much discussion of ""The Lumper,"" the dominant strain of potato in Ireland that happened to be susceptible to a wind-spread fungus that destroyed Lumpers, causing the terrible Potato Famine.  The famine killed one out of every eight people living in Ireland.  Can you imagine that?  Pollan suggests that the Potato Famine is a parable about the dangers of monoculture (planting a single type of plant) -- had the Irish planted a wider variety of potatoes, they might have had more that were resistant to the fungus that killed Lumpers. Also discussed:  how the fast food industry currently relies on a monoculture of the Russet Burbank potato to make the ""long fries"" used in McDonald's, to fill those tall red fry boxes; how that monoculture demands lots of pesticides; and how Monsanto is developing insect-repellant crops -- and what happens with those crops over the long term. I have received an advance screener of this documentary from PBS, but have not been compensated in any way for this post.  I just like PBS and documentaries, and think this is a great program -- and the book is highly recommended as well. * = Note that the program is presented by KQED in San Francisco and produced by Kikim Media.

Rowe has a special kind of charm -- he's simultaneously an everyman, a pitchman, and a funnyman.  His voice is a huge part of his appeal -- Rowe has the ability to intone opinions about pretty much anything, and his rich voice gives it insta-gravitas.  He also makes a lot of jokes, making the whole gravitas situation complex and uncertain -- which is where the funny comes from. So it was a pleasant surprise when I learned last week that Mike Rowe will narrateDiscovery'sversion ofHuman Planet, their latest BBC co-produced mega-documentary.  But why would Mike Rowe, a known wise-ass (albeit abelovedwise-ass with a great talent for voiceover), be narrating a serious documentary?  I can't tell you why exactly this call was made, and I also can't tell you what it sounds like -- because the versions of the documentary I've seen are narrated by somebody else (somebody else who's American).  To make things more complex, the BBC version was narrated byJohn Hurt.  So there are at least three narrators involved in this thing, and the Rowe narration is a big question mark right now.  He has done serious voiceover work before (lots of it), so he's capable of turning off the jokes.  But part of what I love about his work is that jokey quality.  There's not much room in this documentary for jokes.  (Note:  this is a very similar issue toThe Donaghy Probletunitythat arose when Alec Baldwin narratedGreat Migrations:  when you take a guy whose main gig involves jokey gravitas, how can you hear his narration as sincere?) In past mega-documentaries, much has been made about the differences between the BBC and American versions' narrators.  On bothPlanet EarthandLife, Sir David Attenborough provided the BBC narration.  For the US versions, Sigourney Weaver voicedPlanet Earth(capably, but not as well as Attenborough) and Oprah Winfrey didLife(to thereal consternationof many fans).  When the Blu-ray versions came out, I bought both of them -- with the Attenborough narration.  So there's a lot riding on this narration; viewers really care about this stuff.  I like Mike Rowe enough that I think his narration could rival Hurt's BBC narration ofHuman Planet.  But we'll have to wait and see. The final reason that Rowe's narration is such a big deal is that, frankly,Human Planetneeds some narrative help.  It's generally in the same vein as the previous mega-documentariesPlanet EarthandLife, but this time the focus is on people, not nature.  It's about how people live their daily lives under extreme conditions.  And that's something Rowe has experience with, at least from hisDirty Jobdays. Here's the thing aboutHuman Planet:  the producers appears to have gotten their subjects to tell the audience that everything is gonna be okay.  They wrap up each segment with the main documentary subject saying something about how he or she is grateful to have caught a whale, or survived a trek across a barren wilderness, or stolen meat from a lion, or caught a bat so his family could eat a bit of meat, and so on.Every segmenthas this weird wrap-up moment at the end, where it feels very much like the producers asked the subjects to tell us that they're happy with their lot in life, despite living in dangerous, destitute, or (at best) exotic situations.  Sometimes these statements ring true, and you get a nice moment of resolution (there's nothing inherently wrong with many of these people's situation, and I'm not saying they should be unhappy because they're not living western lives) -- but frequently these wrap-up segments fall flat, and I found myself thinking:  ""Why do we need to wrap up these segments with such a tidy ending?""  I can't comment on the producers' intent, but as a viewer, it felt formulaic to have all these people telling us that everything's cool in their lives.  It would have been better just to cut to a wide shot and move on. There's one particularly terrifying segment in the documentary in which disfigured sulphur miners (who are extracting sulphur from an active volcano, gravely injuring themselves in the process) bring their haul back to a weigh station to get paid.  The miners talk about how they're glad to be able to feed their families, since -- and this is true -- the pay for the mining job is better than for other jobs.  They need the work, they need the money to feed their families.  The narrator tells us that the miners won't be able to do their mining jobs for long, because the sulphur takes such a toll on their health.  We see the miners laboring without protective gear, burning their lungs with fumes that will make them sick, disfigured, or dead.  (You can read a good writeuphereof what this job is really like.)  The problem with this segment in the documentary is that it then wraps up and moves on.  The real human story here is the tragedy of these miners -- what happens to the old-timers?  We don't get to see.  What story are we shown instead?  An incredibly beautifully photographed sequence showing men gathering sulphur from a volcano.  So I'm sure this made sense to the producers, because it is certainly an extreme condition that's visually stunning (and it is -- let me be clear, the photography is insanely beautiful).  However, thestoryof thehumanshere is much, much bigger than hauling sulphur up out of the pit.  They deserve more thorough treatment, if this is supposed to be a documentary about them as people in extreme situations.  Their extreme situation is not just mining, it'spoverty.  As it is, their plight is briefly mentioned, we get some sense that they have chosen to do the job because it pays well despite the danger, and, boom!, we're on to the next stunning segment.  This just feels wrong. UPDATE (13 April 2011):after watching the first few broadcast episodes, they seem to have been re-cut and differ from early screeners, removing some of my objections.  There are still wrap-up moments at the end of segments, but we no longer see the subjects themselves saying corny things about how happy they are.  Thank you, editors!  Also, the Rowe narration is excellent. This is the team that brought usPlanet EarthandLife, both of which are fundamentally stunning exercises in documentary photography, and created on a scale that's almost unimaginable -- years of production spanning scores of locations.  The HD photography here is just as beautiful as you'd expect.  Also, the focus on people (despite the wrap-up segments) makes this documentary different from its predecessors in the series -- it's not a nature documentary, it's a documentary about people and their relationship with the natural world.  This is smart, because it gives us opportunities to see what is fundamentally nature photography -- for example, a remarkable sequence in which an eagle is outfitted with a camera on its back and we get to see the eagle's-eye-view as she hunts (see clip above) -- but it also allows us to sit with the people who are training the eagle to hunt, and to understand their narrative. In general,Human Planetdoes a good job of showing us how people live.  In parts this feels like a documentary about hunting (since so many segments are specifically about killing animals for food), but then we see really interesting and bizarre stuff.  My favorite example is the segment about a group of Buddhists living at an altitude where no trees grow, so there is no wood to burn in order to cremate their dead.  So when a member of the group dies, the one non-Buddhist (stop reading if you're squeamish) chops up the body and feeds it to vultures.  This is sort of horrifying (although we don't see graphic footage of the actual hacking, we do see the axe).  But it's also a really good example of a practical challenge that a culture has figured out how to face.  That's a good subject for a documentary, and it's handled well -- except, again, for the weird ""circle of life"" comments by the documentary subjects at the end of the segment. The other remarkable aspect ofHuman Planetis its behind-the-scenes footage.  I only saw a snippet of this, but found it fascinating -- the narrative of the filmmakers interacting with their subjects is just as interesting as seeing the subjects themselves doing their thing.  So when the home video releases come out, you will want to check out the special features showing how this documentary was made -- it took years, and it took a shocking amount of work.  And it's interesting to see the filmmakers explain how they do their thing. From Flickr:  The star and crew of ""Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe"" showed up shortly after dawn to start the day's filming at Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. Rowe was briefed on what to expect by USFWS biologists Jeremy Conrad and Lisa Jameson. Credit: Phil Kloer/USFWS I couldn't resist sending Rowe some questions.  I wasn't sure he'd have a chance to answer them in time for this review, but I'm glad he did -- I got them late last night, and appreciate Rowe taking time out of his schedule to tell me some jokes.  I've loved his work, both the jokey stuff and his genuine concern for blue-collar workers (check outhis podcastfor some of this, or see pretty much any episode ofDirty Jobs).  True to form, he was game, and replied with humor, despite what I assume is an insane production schedule at his day job.  Imagine his deep, rich voice as he answers my dumb questions. Higgins:John Hurt narrated the BBC broadcast ofHuman Planet. Rowe:That's correct. The BBC version is also much longer than the American version. They did 8 hours, we're only doing 6. Studies have proven that British viewers are lot more patient than American viewers. Higgins:So who's better, you or John Hurt? Rowe:John Hurt is annoyingly good. Shockingly good, actually. When I watch him act, I am humbled. When I listen to him speak, I weep. And yet, I am thrilled and eager to usurp him whenever possible. Professional narration is a cruel and nasty business, and as this series clearly illustrates the most deserving characters don't always prevail. Higgins:I remind you, Hurt played the crazy space bazillionaire inContactAND Kane (the first guy to get an Alien on his face/bursting from his chest) inAlien. Rowe:Right. But both of those performances pale next to his work inThe Proposition. Best Australian western ever. Rent it. Watch it. Be amazed. Higgins:Various websites claim you pitched a product called ""Al Edwards Oatmeal."" Rowe:Yes, I've seen those sites as well. I've also seen websites that claim I'm replacing Regis Philbin and Charlie Sheen. Higgins:Is this a real product or an internet prank? Rowe:Al Edwards Oatmeal is very real and quite delicious when supplemented with an equal quantity of brown sugar and whiskey. However, I have no professional or gastronomical history with this particular product. (Interestingly, John Hurt has been the voice of Al Edwards Oatmeal for many, many years. I plan to replace him shortly.) Higgins:Please describe why it's superior to other celebrity-endorsed oatmeals. Rowe:All I can tell you for sure is that any oatmeal not endorsed by Wilfred Brimley is something I'd be willing to try. I've got nothing against Quaker Oats. And I have a great deal of respect for Wilfred's talent and his remarkable resume. Lately though, the angry grandfather thing has become a little frightening. I love a good curmudgeon, but this new level of grumpiness does little to stimulate my appetite. Higgins:I assume you're aware of the popularity of YouTube videos showing your QVC hosting days. Rowe:Yes. My finest hours. Thank you. Higgins:My question is -- how were you able to be so loose with that gig? Rowe:You mean aside from the oatmeal and whiskey? I guess the short answer is ""exhaustion."" QVC had no training program back in 1990. In those days they were desperate for people who could do the job, or at least pull off a fair impersonation of a home shopping host. So anyone capable of talking about a pencil for 5 minutes straight was immediately hired for a three month probationary period and sent to the graveyard shift where they either figured it out on their own or went up in flames.  (Seriously, that was my audition. Look into a camera and talk about a pencil for 5 minutes.) To this day, the most honest and entertaining television I've ever seen featured new QVC hosts trying to figure out how to do their job in front of a live audience. I knew a guy that got so nervous he fainted three times on the air. And a woman who actually threw up on the fake diamonds as she was describing them. Too damn funny to make up. Higgins:It seemed like you were totally aware you'd be fired as soon as anyone in management saw your segments. Rowe:One of my first goals in home shopping was to be fired from home shopping, and I'm proud to say that was accomplished shortly after my debut. The truth is I never should have been hired in the first place. I auditioned to settle a bet, and accepted the offer out of a weird mix of professional curiosity and financial desperation.  I was rehired however under some fairly extraordinary circumstances, and spent the next three years on the overnight shift, languishing under a kind of double secret probation. Most of that time was spent daring management to fire me again, which they eventually did. I can't blame them. I had a habit of falling asleep on the air, making fun of the products, and belittling callers. It was a miracle I made it as long as I did. Higgins:So did you have some other job lined up or what? Rowe:I've never had anything lined up in my life. Higgins:Any plans to release more episodes of your podcast? Rowe:Yeah. I'm gonna write down all the QVC stories and see if I can get John Hurt to read them. It's the least I can do. And that's that.  We'll have to see what Rowe does forHuman Planet.  I have faith that Rowe's narration will fundamentally change the experience of this documentary -- Mike Rowe isn't John Hurt; he'sAmerica'sJohn Hurt. Human Planetpremieres on Sunday, April 10 in the US onDiscovery.  Two episodes air each night, running from 8-10pm EST on April 10, 17, and 24.

724,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/50207/what-do-those-recycling-symbols-and-codes-mean,,"Earth Dayis here again, serving as an annualreminderof the need to reduce, reuse, andrecycleour way to a better planet. When it comes to the last part of that familiar three-”R” mantra, most people know enough to separate certain items from the rest of their garbage, but much of our modernrecyclingroutine remains a mystery. From the recycling symbol itself to what those numbers on plastic containers actually mean, there's a lot you can learn from your trash before it becomes someone else's treasure. The universal recycling symbol—three folded arrows that form a triangle, with the head of one arrow pointing to the tail of the next—was created in 1970 by University of Southern California student Gary Anderson as part of a contest tied to the very firstEarth Day. Each arrow of the design represents one of the steps in the recycling process: collecting the recyclable goods after use, breaking them down and reforming them, and then packaging new products in the containers. Originally designed as an inverted triangle, the symbol was later rotated to the pyramid-like orientation commonly used now. The American Society of Plastics Industry first began usingnumbersinside the recycling symbols on plastic containers in 1988 as a way to assist with sorting them. The ""Resin Identification Code"" uses seven numbers to identify the type of synthetic material used to manufacture the container, with the higher numbers representing less commonly used plastics. Here's a primer on each of the codes: 1. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PETE/PET)Usually accompanied by the letters ""PETE"" or ""PET,"" this resin is generally used for soda bottles and other containers for edible and non-edible goods. When it's not being used to manufacture containers, you might recognize it by another name: polyester. (Yes, it's the stuff that insulates your jackets.) It's also one of the most widely accepted forms of plastic in curbside recycling programs, though the amount of useable material available for new products after breaking down this plastic is relatively small. 2. High Density Polyethylene (HDPE)The second most widely used resin for plastic bottles, HDPE is a stiff, strong material with a high resistance to chemicals, which has made it the go-to plastic for food items like milk and juice, as well as household cleaners and trash bags. It's also easy to break down in the recycling process and easy to reform, making it one of the most efficient consumer plastics. Most curbside recycling programs have no problem with accepting products made from this plastic. 3. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)First discovered in the 19th century, PVC is commonly used in building materials today—especially pipes and plumbing material—due to its strength and chemical resistance (although it's occasionally used for some household products). It has a nasty habit of releasing highly carcinogenic toxins into the atmosphere when it's burned, so recycling is a significantly less appealing option for PVC disposal, and it's usually not accepted by curbside recycling programs. 4. Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)This plastic is becoming more common today, especially for manufacturing squeeze bottles and grocery bags. Plastics made from LDPE are usually very strong, and they're regularly used as sealants because of this quality. While they weren't included in curbside recycling programs at first, plastics made from LDPE are now becoming more commonly accepted. 5. Polypropylene (PP)Regarded as one of the “safest” plastics produced today, PP is generally used for squeezable bottles, bottle caps, and straws. Along with LDPE, it's also used for food-storage containers that can be reused over time. It has an extremely high melting point, so it's one of the best consumer plastics for items that will be exposed to heat. Like LDPE, it's becoming more common for curbside recycling programs to accept items made from this plastic. 6. Polystyrene (PS)More commonly known as styrofoam, this type of plastic is not only notoriously difficult to recycle, but it's also been shown to leach dangerous toxins over time into anything packaged in it—and even greater amounts of toxins when it's burned. This is the resin usually found in disposable serving trays, egg cartons, and cups, and it's rarely accept by curbside recycling programs due to the danger it poses and the difficulty of recycling it. Basically, this is the worst of the bunch. 7. Everything ElseThere are countless other plastics, but very few of them are easily recycled in curbside programs, making this category the catch-all for everything that could conceivably be broken down and reformed, but might be better off reused or reformed in some way that doesn't require a chemical process. This category encompasses everything from bulletproof material to those large water jugs on office coolers, and is rarely included in curbside recycling programs. For anyone wondering which plastics are safe toreusein their current form, it's widely accepted that HDPE (2), LDPE (4), and PE (5) can be reused multiple times for edible items, as they're generally resistant to chemicals, haven't been shown to degrade, and don't leach dangerous substances into their contents. This story first ran in 2013."
725,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/19811/green-water,,"If you're up on your environmental news, you already know water is a big issue. We're not only running out of clean tap water, we're spending billions of dollars and polluting the environment as we haul bottled water all over the country (much of which comes from municipal water supplies). Drought is such an issue here in California, desalinization plants are starting to pop up in the Pacific, but they're controversial too because of the negative effects on our fragile aquatic ecosystems. It's only a matter of years before water is more prized than oil."
726,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49786/how-much-does-cloud-weigh,,"Reader Jane wrote in to note that clouds look so nice and fluffy and lighter-than-air, so they certainly can’t weigh much. Right? When Peggy LeMone was in junior high, a friend’s dad pondered that same question, and she kept it in the back of her mind for years. Now all grown up,LeMoneis a researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and she’s figured out an answer. Today, she shares her cloud-weighing technique with us. First, figure out how dense the cloud is. Scientists have measured the water density of a typical cumulus cloud (the white, fluffy ones you see on a nice day) as 1/2 gram per cubic meter—about a small marble’s worth of water in a space you and a friend could comfortably sit in. The density will be greater for different types of clouds. Next, figure out how big the cloud is. By measuring a cloud’s shadow when the sun is directly above it, you can get an idea of its width. LeMone does this by watching her odometer as she drives under a cloud. A typical cumulus, she says, is about a kilometer across, and usually roughly cubical—so a kilometer long and a kilometer tall, too. This gives you a cloud that’s one billion cubic meters in volume. Do the math with the density and volume to determine the total water content of the cloud. In this case, it's 500,000,000 grams of water, or 1.1 million pounds. That’s a lot of weight to wrap your head around, so LeMone suggests putting it in more familiar terms, like elephants. That cloud weighs about as much as 100 elephants. If you’re a Democrat and you’re feeling partisan, she says, you could substitute 2500 donkeys. If you care more for dinosaurs than politics, you could also say the cloud weighs about as much as 33 apatosauruses. If all those elephants or donkeys or dinosaurs were hanging out in the sky, they’d fall. So how does a several-hundred-ton cloud stay afloat? For one thing, the weight isn’t concentrated in a hundred elephant-sized particles or even a billion marble-sized ones. It’s distributed among trillions ofreallytiny water droplets spread out over a really big space. Some of these droplets are so small that you would need a million of them to make one raindrop, and gravity’s effect on them is pretty negligible. What’s more, the cloud is less dense than dry air, so it's buoyant. It also helps that all those little droplets get some lift from updrafts of warm air. Those droplets don’t float forever, though. When the cloud’s water density increases and the droplets get bigger and heavier, the cloud eventually does fall, bit by little bit, in the form of rain."
727,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30307/messing-mother-nature-macquarie-island-ecosystem,,"The story of the Macquarie Island ecosystem may remind you of the song about the woman who swallowed a fly. The island was exploited mercilessly, but various plans to repair the damage had their own unintended consequences. Introducing a non-native species to control another invasive species can backfire and escalate the situation to ridiculous and tragic levels. Macquarie Island, part of the Australian state of Tasmania, is aUNESCO World Heritage Site. The island lies in a spot where tectonic plates meet, about halfway between New Zealand and Antarctica, and has unique geological significance. Macquarie is a breeding ground for aquatic life, particularlyelephant seals and royal penguins. It is also home to other seals and penguins, several species of albatross and other sea birds, plus a few dozen wildlife scientists and park rangers who work there on a temporary basis. The seals and penguins had no natural enemies on the island until Europeans arrived in 1810. Since then, humans have hatched schemes to either exploit or repair the Macquarie Island ecosystem. Most of these schemes caused further problems. Polynesians may have inhabited the island in the distant past, but there were no people there when it was discovered byCaptain Frederick Hasselboroughof the shipPerseverancein 1810. He was looking for seals, and Macquarie Island proved to be a bounty. Fur seals and then elephant seals were hunted almost to extinction on the island. When the seal supply ebbed, penguins were hunted for their oil.Photograph by Wikipedia userHullwarren. Meanwhile, any place on earth that was visited by exploring ships ran the risk of introducing rats to the ecosystem. Macquarie Island had no rodents before the seal hunting began, but mice and ratsbegan to flourishsoon afterward.Photograph by Wikipedia userKilessan. Seafarers knew how to control rats. Most ships had a cat or two just for this purpose. Within ten years of the commencement of sealing, there were feral cats on the island. While rats are omnivores, they only become predators when the easier food is in short supply. Some species of fur seals eat penguins, but the cats were the first land-based true predators on the island. In addition to rodents, the cats ate seabirds. William Elder of the Otago Whaling Companybrought rabbits to the islandas afood sourcein 1870. They, of course, bred like rabbits. Despite being eaten by both cats and people, the wild rabbit population soared to 130,000 on the tiny island within 100 years. Rabbits ate the grass, which allowed erosion to damage the island, and subsequent storms and tremors destroyed erosion-damaged penguin breeding grounds. Stoats, a species of weasel, were brought in tocontrol the rabbitson Macquarie Island and in New Zealand soon after the feral population of rabbits became established. Soon the stoat population was helping itself to seabirds and their eggs.Photograph by Flickr userMarkus Hoppe. Aspossumswere introduced to New Zealand to raise for fur, they made their way to Macquarie Island as well. The cats weren't all that interested in possums, so they bred to the point of becoming pests along with the other introduced species.Photograph by Flickr userPeter Firminger. As the populations of non-native species grew on Macquarie Island, a time bomb was ticking. When the balance of predators and food supplies reaches a certain point, predators will turn to different species to eat. TheMacquarie parakeetflourished on the island until around 1880, when the rabbit supply allowed the number of feral cats to explode, and the cats branched out to eat parakeets. The last Macquarie parakeet was sighted in 1891, and the species became extinct. Of course, the feral cats, while still eating rabbits, went after other native birds. Shown is thered-crowned parakeetof New Zealand, which is similar in appearance to the Macquarie parakeet.Photograph byThomas Mattern. When Macquarie Island began to be used as a science station in the 20th century, seal hunting met its end. Antarctic explorer Douglas Mawson spearheaded the drive to declare the island a nature reserve, and it was his efforts thatforced the end of sealing. The last load of oil was taken off the island in 1919. In 1933, Macquarie Island became an official wildlife preserve. Meanwhile, as the seal and penguin population slowly began to recover, the island was still overrun with rabbits. Australian scientists hatched a plan to control rabbits (which were out of control in all of Australia) by introducing the virus Myxoma which causesMyxomatosis, a disease fatal to rabbits. First, rabbit fleas were brought to the island in 1968 (yetanotherinvasive species) as a future carrier of the virus. The environment being what it was, the establishment of fleaswasn't as successful as had been hoped. The virus itself was introduced on the island in 1978. Therabbit population plungedfrom 130,000 to around 10,000, which is the good news. The bad news is that the remaining rabbits were the ones that were immune to the disease. With most of the rabbits gone, the estimated 500 feral cats on Macquarie Island knew what to do. They ate the native seabirds -up to 60,000 of them every year. The government of Australia decided the only thing to do at that point was to eliminate the feral cats. Cat hunting was encouraged beginning in 1985. The Tasmanian governmentintensified the program in 1997, using traps and dogs to catch the cats. The last feral cat was caught in 2000. No more cats on Macquarie Island. Problem solved? Oh no! With the cats gone, those 10,000 rabbits who were immune to the Myxoma virusbegan to multiply again. The Tasmanian government came to the conclusion that all non-native species had to be eradicatedat the same time. That would be the only way to restore the nature preserve to its intended use for the original sea animals. Thecurrent eradication programbegan in 2010. But even that has its problems. The poison bait used to eliminate invasive mammals is working its way through the ecosystem. Just last year, we learned of the death ofthousands of seabirdsthat ate the carcasses of the poisoned mammals.Albatross photograph by Wikipedia userHullwarren.

728,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33572/has-us-river-run-backwards,,"The ongoing drought conditions wreaking havoc across large swaths of the country have driven the water in Lake Michigan an inch below its previousrecord low, and aren’t stopping. Last month, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineersannouncedthat, if this continues and the lake water drops below the level of the Chicago River, the river could reverse course and begin flowing back towards its source. (Thankfully, there’s a series oflocksseparating the two, which will help prevent the less-than-clean river from flowing into the lake and the city’s source of drinking water.) Has an American river ever done an about-face like this before? Oh yeah. In fact, the Chicago has done it before. If the river does reverse course, it won’t be running backwards so much as running forwards again. When Europeans first settled in the Chicago area, the river drained into Lake Michigan, which was fine—except that settlers used the river to dump waste, and used the lake for drinking water. As the city grew, there were numerous outbreaks of typhoid and cholera because of contaminated drinking water, and something had to be done. In the late 1800s, the city decided to solve their problem with an ambitious engineering feat: They would reverse the flow of the river and send it away from the lake and towards the Mississippi River. The so-called “Chicago Diversion” worked: It not only diverted contaminated water away from the city’s drinking water, but also connected the Great Lakes and Mississippi River water systems and opened up the possibility of commercial travel and trade between them. It hasn't been just barges and haulers that could cross from one system to the other, though. Invasive Asian carp, introduced decades ago to southern fish farms as pond cleaners, have gradually made their way north, threatening native species and altering food webs as they go. With the fish nearing the Great Lakes, theideaof un-reversing (re-reversing?) the Chicago River has been kicked around, but now it looks like the river could take care of the problem itself. The most famous of American Rivers, the mighty Mississippi, also might have gone backwards more than once. In 1811 and 1812, three earthquakes—themost powerfulto ever hit the eastern U.S.—struck what was then a sparsely populated area of the Louisiana Territory. Eyewitness accounts from the quake read like Michael Bay scripts: The ground rippled and quivered; chasms opened up and swallowed livestock and wagons; sand and dirt exploded from the ground like volcanic eruptions and blotted out the sun; the Mississippi shook with such violence that the water ran backwards and boats were dragged upstream. One boatman, wanting to get away from the trees falling over on the river banks, put his boat out into the middle of the river and soonfound, he claimed, that “the current changed, and the boat hurried up, for about the space of a minute, with the velocity of the swiftest horse,” fast enough that he had to hold on to his hat to keep it on his head. Gradually, the man said, the river returned to its normal course. Exactly how long that took is unclear, and various firsthand accounts have the river going backwards for anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Whether the river even reversed itself at all is questionable, and the United States Geological Survey says that ground uplifts and waves moving upstream may have just created theillusionthat the water was moving backwards. What’s more certain is that the Mississippi reversed course for about 24 hours whenHurricane Isaacstruck last year, and when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005."

But no matter how things look from the ground, these events look drastically different, even surprisingly peaceful, from above. Here are some of the biggest weather events of the last few decades, as seen from space. Most of us remember the severe devastation Hurricane Katrina (top image) caused, and it’s easy to see why the storm presented so many problems when seen from above—the arms of the hurricane expanded across most of the Gulf of Mexico. When this image was taken on August 28, 2005, winds in the storm were recorded traveling at about 160 mph. Katrina was not only one of the five deadliest hurricanes in U.S. history—it was also the most expensive natural disaster in the country's history, causing more than $108 billion in damages. Just last year, the Floss headquarters was closed for weeks thanks to this massive hurricane that caused over $75 billion in damage. While not due to one storm in particular, the winter of 2009 through 2010 was unusually cold throughout Europe, earning the season the title of “The Big Freeze.” This satellite image from January 7, 2010 shows the extent of snow covering over England and Scotland. Europe wasn’t the only area hit hard by winter that season. On February 5, 2010, the North Atlantic coast was hit by a category 3 (major) blizzard. Up to 35 inches of snow was dropped on the East Coast of the U.S. The area was already suffering from the effects of a blizzard that had occurred in December, and when another category 3 blizzard happened only a few days later, bringing another 20 inches of snow, the media began pronouncing the event “snowpocalypse,” “snoverkill” and “snowmageggon.” Catchy nicknames aside, the storms resulted in the snowiest winter on record for much of the Mid-Atlantic, which is easy to imagine given how much snow is visible in this satellite image taken on February 11. While it might not be as famous as many of the other storms on this list, 2004’s Cyclone Gafilo is the most intense cyclone to ever form in the south-western Indian Ocean and the strongest cyclone to strike Madagascar. With winds reaching over 185 miles per hour, the storm caused more than $250 million in damages and resulted in 172 deaths. This image shows the cyclone on March 6, after it reached peak speed and was about to strike northwest Madagascar. When someone says “extreme weather,” you probably think of wet conditions, but when high winds hit sand, they can result in massive dust storms that can be just as intense as a blizzard. In September of 2009, a dust storm hit Eastern Australia, sweeping dirt and debris across New South Wales and Queensland. Typically, air particle concentrations register at 20 micrograms per cubic meter of air. During bushfires, the air particle concentration raises to about 500 micrograms per cubic meter. So you can imagine how concentrated the dust must have been for the air concentration levels to reach 15,400 during the storm. It’s been estimated that the storm carried over 16 million tons of dust from the desert to the coast, at a peak level of 75,000 tons per hour. Many would hesitate to call wildfires a weather event, but in most cases, weather is at least partially responsible. This was definitely the case in the California wildfires of October 2003, where over 15 wildfires broke out throughout Southern California and Baja, Mexico. I was in San Diego when the fires first broke out and there was so much thick, white ash in the air that even 20 miles from the fires, it looked like the roads were covered in snow. I was also present for the 2007 California wildfires, which were a result of many of the same weather conditions as the 2003 fires, which have become a seasonal problem for the region. Were any of you witness to these events, or do you have any extreme weather stories of your own? While everyone loves a good story, you might consider yourself lucky if your answer is “no” this time."
730,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/51266/how-spiders-win-lottery,,"On a cloudy spring day, a little spider scales a tall blade of grass. At the peak, the spider arches up, points its abdomen up to the sky and begins releasing strands of silk from its silk glands. Tens of thousands of strands fill the air, fanning out and then coming back together to form a triangular sheet. A passing breezes catches the silk and suddenly the spider is airborne, riding its homemade parachute into the wild blue yonder. Spider use these “ballooning” flights to escape from danger and to colonize new habitats. Most times, they only travel a few feet, but the right conditions can carry a spider over vast distances. Sailors have found them landing on ships thousands of miles from shore, and scientists have discovered eight-legged travelers in air samples collected by atmospheric data balloons. All sorts of tiny arthropods travel this way, and some plants and fungi also use the wind to spread seeds, spores and pollen. Scientists call itpassive airborne dispersaland from our perspective,passiveis the key word. The tiny flyers seem to be left at the mercy of the elements and there seems to be little opportunity for them to strategize or make the most of their trip. The direction and distance they travel—or whether they travel at all or get stuck waiting to take off—are decided by the movement, direction and speed of the air. Some researchers dub it the “aerial lottery.” The flyer buys their ticket, catches a breeze and crosses their metaphorical fingers that they land safely in a place they want to be. Whether they’ve won (new habitat, safe from danger, yay) or lost (atmospheric data balloon, boo) isn’t revealed until they’ve landed, and by then their play is over. The journey appears completely out of their hands, yet many passive dispersers wind up exactly where they should want to be: still sort of close to where they started (where there are reliable, if shrinking, resources), but away on their own with untapped resources and no competition from their fellow spiders/seeds/whatever-they-ares. This winning play is the “shortest unique flight,” similar to the “lowest unique bid” needed to win some auctions and games. Despite all appearances, then, there may be a way to improve one’s odds of winning. The trick to winning the aerial lottery, scientists think, is all in the take off, the last stage of the game where the “player” still has some control. Plants and fungi have been known to launch their wind-dispersed pollen, spores and seed only in certain conditions. Spiders and other wind-sailing critters, meanwhile, can choose the time and location of their launch. New research byAndy M. Reynoldsfrom the UK’s Rothamsted agricultural research stationsuggeststhat a winning strategy is based on taking flight in specific weather conditions. Warm, gentle breezes on days with some cloud cover are ideal for making the shortest unique flight. In more stable conditions the flight might be unique, but will last longer. In less stable conditions, the flights are shorter but less likely to be unique. The ideal launch seasons, Reynolds suggests, are spring and autumn, exactly when spiders tend to ramp up their “ballooning behavior.” Whether these creatures win or lose at their lottery is more relevant to us than you might think at first. Spiders are a great help in controlling pests, and knowing where and when they take flight can benefit farmers. “Each day of the growing season around 1,800 spiders land in each hectare of arable farmland after ballooning,” Reynolds said in a statement about the study. “If the farmers can predict the influx of spiders, they can reduce the amount of pesticides accordingly,"" saving money and hassle. Similarly, being able to predict the spread of problematic fungi can help control them and the diseases they cause, giving us a leg up in this strange game of chance."
731,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/22756/10-unusual-playgrounds-around-world,,"Playgrounds have come a long way since the early days of hot, steel slides and open-backed infant swings. Safety is a big issue on today's playgrounds, but so is imagination and ingenuity. Take a look at some of the many unusually cool designs popping up around the world. And if you have a favorite we left off the list (which could easily have been twice as long), be sure to tell us about it in the comments. In Japanese, Nishi-Rokugo means Tire Park. The Kawasaki plants are located not far away, so it's possible they donated the 3,000 tires that make up the dinosaurs, monsters, bridges, slides, swings, and all the loose ones there for kids to stack and hop on. But this sand-bottom park is hardly just for kids. Parents can haul tires up specially designed tire steps and tube down wide concrete slides. I can imagine it's the type of place you can spend hours at before you, er,tire,of it. 2. The Fruit and Scent Playground ""“Liljeholmen, Sweden A banana slide, strawberry spinners, apairof cherry swings, an orange see-saw and a watermelon jungle gym are all part of this unusual, small park in the south of Stockholm. It's a great theme because it also teaches kids the importance of fruit over junk food. Reports coming out of the country indicate that the outdoors-loving Swede is on the way out. According to a study by Karolinska university hospital, obesity among seven year olds in Stockholm has increased from 8.5% to 21% over the last fifteen years. What could be better than exercising in fruit as an antidote? Not just the name is unusual at Clemyjontri Park in Fairfax County, Virginia. This place is one of the few playgrounds in the world where children with disabilities can play side-by-side those without. The entire park is equipped with ramps for wheelchairs and the ground surfaces are specially designed with a non-slip material. The park is named for Adele Lebowitz's (a major donor) four children: Carolyn (CL), Emily (EMY), John (Jon), and Petrina (Tri). Mrs. Lebowitz and her husband were also sponsors of a local children's television show, The Pick Temple Show, in the 1950s. The star of that show, a clown named Bozo, was played by Willard Scott. It may be the only playground in the world created specifically for seniors. In fact, anyone under 16 is not allowed inside Berlin's Pruessen Park, nicknamed the ""Playground for Grown-Ups."" The equipment is specifically designed for people over five feet tall and caters to Germany's fastest growing age demographic: seniors. The idea, obviously, is to encourage them to get out and exercise more. Perhaps the first playground in the world with a technology theme, Dubai's Zabeel Technology Park has two zones featuring futuristic technology and alternative energy exhibits, a series of high tech interactive displays, and a maze modeled on the solar system. The Children's Playground in the Takino Hillside Park in Japan borrows ideas and images from nature. Varied lighting and sound conditions create a unique sensory experience for kids, unlike anything else on this list. Check out the cool net play tool in the rainbow nest dome. You can see how a lot of the park is built into, and under the hill. St Kilda Adventure Playground is one of Australia's best known parks and covers 4 hectares along the beautiful South Australian seafront. The park was opened in 1982 and recent upgrades include a wooden castle, a small maze, and a submarine, nicknamed ""The Yellow Submarine."" But the park's biggest attraction is the beached pirate shipwreck, which is especially popular with dolphins and other sea wildlife. Located between residential buildings in Battery Park City, Teardrop Park is unlike anything else in NYC. Built for a whopping $17 million, the park features prominent rock outcroppings, geologic formations, a secret path, a bluestone ice wall, a humongous, almost dangerous looking slide, sandboxes, water play areas, a reading space with rock seats, and places to rock hop. Best of all, because it's not so easy to find, Teardrop Park is a real insiders secret. (Shhhhh.) It may sound like an unsafe setting, but the rooftop at Yerba Gardens in San Francisco is home to one of the most elaborate playgrounds ever constructed. Aside from the ice-skating rink, bowling center and the 130,000 square feet of open space to play in, the playground includes a beautiful 103-year-old hand carved carousel. The Zeum carousel was constructed in 1906 but could not be installed in San Francisco as originally planned because of earthquake issues. It was eventually housed at Luna Park in Seattle, where it was the only piece of equipment to survive a horrific 1911 fire. The city of San Francisco bought the carousel from a collector in 1998 and restored it to its original condition. It now serves at the centerpiece in Yerba Gardens Spanish architects Eduardo Navadijos and Csaba Tarsoly designed this stunning modern playground with the intention of giving children inspiration to pursue their dreams in an airy and cool environment. I've never been to Madrid, a mere 30 minutes drive from Boadilla del Monte, but when I do finally get there, this playground is my first stop."
732,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49193/painting-frogs-licking-wounds-other-adventures-poisonous-animals,,"In the current issue of the magazine, I’ve got an article called “Fifty Shades of Prey,” about poison dart frogs and some new research into why they come in so many dazzling colors and patterns. I was drawn to the story not only because of what Canadian biologist Mathieu Choteau discovered about these frogs (which is pretty cool all by itself), but also by all the stuff he went through along the way. His research involved hand-molding and painting several thousand fake frogs with the help of his girlfriend, getting them on a plane to Peru (worried what airport security might say when they opened his bag), and then painstakingly pinning them to leaves while trudging through the rainforest. Going back even further into what we know about dart frogs and other poisonous animals, there are plenty of other intrepid scientists and strange sounding field work. I couldn’t fit all of their stories into the magazine piece, so I wanted to share a little bit about two of them here. The first is a guy namedJohn W. Daly. In the early 1960s, not long after he took a job at the National Institutes of Health, he was sent on a research errand by the head of his lab. Certain native tribesmen in Colombia were known to coat the tips of their hunting arrows and blowgun darts with skin secretions from local frogs, which gave the weapons a toxic punch. The senior scientist wanted someone to go down to the rainforest, harvest some frogs, and analyze the chemicals in their skin. He’d been unable to find someone in the lab, though, who 1) had experience in the field and could handle a trip to the rainforest, and 2) he could afford to commit to research that might not pan out. Daly fit the bill perfectly. He was a chemist by training, but always had an interest in biology. He’d grown up in Oregon collecting frogs, snakes, and lizards and keeping them in his own little zoo in the basement. He was also young and a new hire, so they could get away with paying less for the field work than the other scientists. Daly was soon in the Amazon collecting frogs for a $16 per diem. Without many resources to work with, he developed an unusual way to figure out which frogs were worth examining and which weren’t. He’d slide a finger along a frog's skin, and then touch his tongue. If he experienced a burning sensation in his mouth, then the frog was worth a look. Fortunately, Daly took the locals’ advice about one particular frog. Even experienced tribal hunters only handledPhyllobates terribiliswith the utmost care—it’s the most poisonous of the dart frogs and may be the most poisonous vertebrate in the world. Daly’s time tasting frogs in the rainforest eventually led to the discovery of thebatrachotoxins(“frog poison”), the class of alkaloid poisons that make some of these frogs so deadly. In the early 1970s, Daly and colleaguespublishedthe chemical structure of the toxin and detailed its biological effects. Almost 20 years later and thousands of miles away,John Dumbacher, a grad student at the University of Chicago, was studying the courtship and mating behaviors of theRaggiana Bird-of-paradisein Papua New Guinea. He and his research team stretched nets between trees to capture the birds for study, and sometimes caught other birds by accident. Some of these were songbirds known asHooded Pitohuis. As Dumbacher tried to free these birds, they’d bite or scratch at his hands and sometimes he would get cut. Rather than stopping his work and finding a place to wash his wounds, he would usually just pop the injured finger in his mouth to give the cut a quick clean. Just a few minutes later, though, his tongue and lips would start to tingle and burn a little. The sensation wasn’t awful—Dumbacher has compared it to eating a chili pepper or touching your tongue to a 9-volt battery—but it was puzzling, and after another student experienced the same thing, Dumbacher began to wonder if it was the bird’s fault. The next time a pitohui got caught in one of the nets, Dumbacher and the other student tasted one of the feathers. Sure enough, their mouths started to tingle and burn. They asked a few of the team’s forest guides about it and learned that the locals called the pitohuis “rubbish birds” or “garbage birds” and wouldn’t eat them, unless they were skinned and specially prepared for safety and flavor. The birds, Dumbacher realized, might be poisonous. While poisonous birds were sometimes rumored to exist, none had ever been scientifically confirmed, and the idea wasn’t always considered legitimate. Dumbacher wanted some pitohui feathers analyzed for toxins, but couldn’t find a chemist who would take his hypothesis seriously. Dumbacher returned to the U.S. with a bunch of feathers in 1990. Knowing about Daly’s experience with poisonous vertebrates, he called the NIH, a little bit worried that Daly would laugh him off as “just a nutty kid.” Daly was curious, though, and took the feathers and began to run some tests. When he took extracts from the feather and injected them into a mouse, it began to convulse and quickly died. He called Dumbacher back looking for more samples from the birds—the young man seemed to be onto something. Daly eventually isolated what he believed to be the toxic compound and had a colleague run a chemical analysis on it. When the colleague called him with the compound’s analysis, Daly recognized the characteristics and patterns immediately. It was the same chemical he’d found, identified, described, and named decades earlier. Batrachotoxin, the “frog poison,” had turned up in a bird. Daly, Dumbacher, and their colleagues announced their discovery two years later in apaperinScience,and the hooded pitohui became the first confirmed poisonous bird. A decade later, theblue-capped ifritabecame thesecond. What was frog poison doing in two different types of birds? How could the frogs and birds, separated by vast oceans and so many twists and turns of evolutionary history, produce the same toxin—not a similar toxin, but the exact same one? More than a decade of work by Dumbacher, Daly and other researchers suggests that these odd, toxic bedfellows get their toxins from their diets. In Papua New Guinea, Dumbacher heard reports from locals of a few types of beetle that caused tingling and burning sensations on contact. He found those same beetles in the stomachs of the pitohuis and later found that they contained high concentrations of batrachotoxin. In a 2004paper, he suggested that the bugs provided a natural toxin source for the birds, and that other bugs might do the same for poison dart frogs. Daly had touched on thesameideabefore, noticing that a change in the frogs’ diet altered their toxic profile. Around the same time as Dumbacher’s study, Daly and colleagues from the NIH and elsewhere found evidence thatantsand “mossmites” in Central America contained some of the same alkaloids as the frogs and made up a large portion of their diet. This second study supporting the toxic diet idea was one of the last papers Daly published before hisdeathin 2008."

While opposing nuclear testing and supporting environmental causes, Greenpeace has routinely been in the media spotlight, and often seeks out media coverage to promote its cause.  Here are a few funny (and a few sad) moments in Greenpeace history. In 2007, Greenpeace held an online contest to name a humpback whale in the Southern Ocean.  Surfers were invited to create a list of potential names, then to vote for their favorite name from the list.

There's plenty of official""Mr. Splashy Pants Gear""available for those who love the splashy whale icon, but don't want to get all political. The sinking caused a major international scandal, with French officials initially denying involvement.  Two of the French agents were charged and imprisoned, while others were released due to issues of international law.  Information about French President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand's approval of the mission surfaced in 2005, shortly after he left office(update:  this was a mistake; officials including French Defence Minister Charles Hernu resigned and Admiral Pierre Lacoste was fired as a result of the bombing).  You can read more about the sinking at theTimes Online, or onWikipedia. (Photo of Rainbow Warrior hull damage by Gil Hanly, via an excellent article inFacsimile Magazine.) Greenpeace UK put together a short film starring comedians Eddie Izzard, Jim Broadbent, and Joe McFadden.  In the film, a group of corporate aliens hold a meeting regarding a proposed takeover of planet Earth.  The result is a funny, inspiring piece conveying the Greenpeace message with a light touch.  Check it out: In 2005, Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior II was on assignment examining Tubbataha Reef Marine Park reef in the Philippines for signs of bleaching due to global warming.  During the exercise, the Rainbow Warrior II accidentally ran aground on the reef itself, damaging corals in the process.  Greenpeace was fined almost $7,000 for damaging the reef it was seeking to protect.  More from aBBC News article:"

In fact, wherever it was once thought that no life could exist, more and more organisms are being found that not only live, but thrive and evolve. The boiling waters of Yellowstone National Park and other extreme thermal environments have species ofthermophiles, or organisms that thrive in temperatures that would kill most living things. These thermophiles have specialized enzymes that keep their DNA from unraveling the way other life forms would.

Bacteria even live in the clouds! These microbes act as particles that ice form around and fall as snow or rain. They are called biologicalice nucleators. Nucleators are found in plants and soil and are thought toride on pollenas it is blown into the atmosphere. The part of the bacterial life cycle spent on vegetation may sustain an ice nucleator during its ride in the clouds, and the cloud seeding may be a mechanism for spreading it to distant parts of the earth.

735,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49035/operation-migration-saving-whooping-crane,,"Dan Lewis runs the popular daily newsletterNow I Know(""Learn Something New Every Day, By Email""). We've invited him to share some of his stories on mental_floss this week. To subscribe to his daily email,click here. The whooping crane is an endangered bird native to North America. Before Europeans settled in the New World, there were an estimated 10,000 of them. By the late 1800s, that number fell to about 1500. In 1941, there were 23—two in captivity and just under two dozen in the wild. Joe Duff wanted to fix that. To do so, he and his colleagues decided to dress up kind of like the whooping cranes they wanted to save. Duff is the co-founder and CEO of a not-for-profit organization calledOperation Migration. The whooping crane population is at risk mostly due to habitat loss—the areas they have been migrating to and from, for generations, have slowly been eroded away as people have moved in. Each subsequent generation of cranes learns the migratory path by following their parents and, unfortunately, the parents were going into a long-destroyed habitat; many did not survive the season. Without parents to guide them, the younger cranes were lost, and they, too, perished. To combat this, Operation Migration uses a development from the 1980s and 1990s. A Canadian ultralight aircraft enthusiast named Bill Lishman—who would later become Duff’s co-founder—theorized that certain waterfowl could be trained to follow such a plane to a different migratory destination. In 1993, Lishman successfully led a group sixteen of Canada geese from Ontario to Virginia. Thirteen of the sixteen returned to Ontario the next year—without needing a human guide. Lishman’s innovation centered on the fact that waterfowl, soon after their birth, imprint upon the first creature they see. Typically, this is their birth mother, but in a controlled environment, it could be basically any animal—including a person, if conditions are right. Duff, in an interview with NPR’sTalk of the Nation, explained: “Whooping cranes are hatched in the nest, in a marsh on the ground, basically, and they leave the nest almost immediately and follow their parents out to forage for food. And if they don’t follow their parents, they’re lost. So that natural instinct to imprint is there, and we just substitute parent for pilot and make sure they imprint on us.” The pilots wear the above-seen costumes so that the whooping cranes, when reintroduced to the wild, are not familiar with humans. Duff does not want them to learn that other people they come across are going to coddle and care for them because, simply, they won’t. Once the cranes are able—assuming they’ve learned to follow the pilot—Operation Migration continues their conditioning, training them to follow the ultralight aircraft, as seen below. According toan interview Duff did with VetStreet.com, there are now roughly 500 whooping cranes in the wild—a roughly 20-fold increase in just a few generations, although there is a long way to go. And there are unexpected problems along the way.As reported by the Sierra Club, toward the end of 2011 and into 2012, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily grounded Operation Migration’s aircraft due to an unclear rule requiring the organization to obtain a special waiver before they took flight again. They are working with the FAA on a permanent solution to allow the flights to go off without further problems. To subscribe to Dan's daily email Now I Know,click here.

I usually toss such things straight into the trash bin, but I really liked the branding and design on the postcard so I sat down and read the offer. They lease you the panels at no money down and within a few years, you're saving money on your electric bill. Though you're never off the grid, the solar energy supplements the power you get from your local provider and, in some cases, depending on how much sun you're capturing, you can even get credit from your local energy supplier if you're giving back more AC to the grid than you're taking. I was pretty certain at that point that it was time to give it a whirl. When I saw that they were offering a free iPad as incentive to the first 100 people who signed up, it became a no brainer because I was about to buy one anyway. Now, before everyone starts screaming ""Shill, shill!"" let me say that I don't care if you want to use Sungevity to power your home or not. I don't care if you take advantage of the $500 cash in your pocket I can get them to give you through our ""Friends of the _floss"" code or not. (Wait for it...) I'm really just writing this post because working with these guys has been one of the most pleasurable experiences I've ever had dealing with a power company, contracting company, building contractor, etc. In fact, they're right up there with the Apple care team in terms of friendliness, politeness and efficacy. I guess what I'm saying is, if Sungevity sold refrigerators, I'd buy them. Cars, I'd buy them... heck, if they sold and serviced nuclear energy solutions, I'd probably buy it! (Well, maybe not... but you get my drift.) What follows is a photo essay of the installation process for those who are curious as to how this works and what's involved. From start to finish, the process takes about 3 months. First you have to go to their Web site and see if they service your area. Then you see if your house is solar-able (if your southern exposure is blocked by trees or a taller structure, you can't do it). After that, they send someone out to the house to check the structure from an engineering point of view. If that goes smoothly, they pull permits from the city and contact your local power company to get approval. Soon, they are pulling up to your house with the gear! The next thing they do is unpack everything and install casings on the roof where the panel tracks will attach. Meantime, the electrician arrives and is busy installing the converter that takes the DC and turns it into AC. By now, the panel tracks are being installed on the roof. These will hold the panels steady and are suspended about 6"" off the roof. Meantime, the electrician is installing the meter on the back of the house. And now, the panels are connected to the tracks! More... And the money shot! And voila! She is all done! Oh, and the free iPad... guess who commandeered that a week after we got it? Again, it's worth repeating: Through the whole process, these guys really, er,shonebrightly.

737,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49237/whats-difference-between-climate-change-and-global-warming,,"Most of us have been taught the basics of the greenhouse effect: The sun shoots its rays through the atmosphere (orozone holes); those rays bounce off the Earth's surface and, when they try to escape back into space, are trapped by carbon dioxide, methane, and other heat-trapping gases. Release too many of these so-called greenhouse gases, repeat the process, andvoila!You have global warming. A slightly warmer globe will not necessarily change the climate. Heat the planet enough, however, and you get lots of wild, indirect consequences—which scientists like to put under the blanket termclimate change. While global warming is a specific function of these trapped gases, climate change is just more complicated. Ocean acidification is one clear example of climate change that isn’t at all part of global warming. Sure, the surface temperature of the ocean is getting warmer, salinity is changing due to ice melt, and the sea levels are rising. All of this can be attributed to a warming planet. But oceans also store half of all the carbon released by man and nature. A side effect of more carbon in the air is increasing the carbon absorbed by the oceans, which changes the acidity of the waters—a devastating problem, especially to sea creatures whose shells can’t handle the change. Acidification may be due to a particular greenhouse gas, but not its role in warming the atmosphere. “We are dumping carbon into the ocean which is changing the pH,” saysJohn Abraham, a professor of thermal sciences at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. “Is that global warming? Not really.” In another example, was Superstorm Sandy in 2012—and other massive storms like it—caused by global warming or climate change? To many scientists, this weather event was a clear product of global warming. Warming temperatures lead to more evaporation and more moisture in the air, warmer oceans, and a more energetic storm. Then there was the unusual movement of a cold jet stream that made a dip south from Canada, giving tons of energy to Sandy and helping it land where it did. This happened due to a change in the North Atlantic Oscillation, a pressure system that likely flipped because of a rise in arctic ice melt due to—drum roll please—warming temperatures. “Events like Sandy are more likely and made worse because of warming,” Abraham tells Mental Floss. “But they’re manifested in other ways: heavier precipitation events, and flooding, and sea level rise. Most people don’t link [things like] precipitation directly to global warming.” This, in a nutshell, is the reason scientists prefer the termclimate change—it’s a better way to describe insanely complex systems."
738,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/20227/made-america-worlds-fastest-electric-car,,"Some of you who've been with us from the beginning might recallMangesh's posta couple years back about Tesla's high-end electric sports car, made in Silicon Valley. In the post, Mango wrotemental_floss' favorite inventor Nikola Tesla, who famously dreamed up AC current amongst a million other things, and inspired the names for the rock bands Tesla and AC/DC (or at least the first-half of the name AC/DC), now has a ridiculously cool electric car named for him""¦[Tesla] even plans on releasing a family sedan by 2008. And while the sedan is still a couple years off, the Roadster, which Mangesh referred to, is not only selling pretty well (for a vehicle with a base sticker price that's more than $100K), but showrooms are slowly starting to open outside Silicon Valley. One opened in L.A. not too long ago and I had the privilege of interviewing the guy who runs it, Jeremy Snyder. So if you're into really fast cars, really expensive cars, or just environmentally friendly cars, read on for the lowdown on Tesla, right from the manager's mouth. DI: So where exactly is Tesla based? JS:San Carlos, California, though the cars are assembled in Menlo Park. DI: The parts are made here too? JS:The final assembly is here in California. We're an American car company. While the parts are from all over the world, the battery pack, which is a big part of the car, is made here in California. DI: And how many different models are there at the moment? JS:Just the Roadster right now, which is our flagship model. But we've got a four-door, five-passenger sedan coming out called Model S, which will be available in a couple years. DI: So let's talk about the Roadster. What's all the hubbub? JS:It's a very important car because it's 100% electric. We wanted to enter the market place and shatter any preconceived notions. Efficiency and performance need not be mutually exclusive. The car was designed with three principles in mind: Great design, ultra-high performance, while being the most efficient car in the world. It does 0-60 in 3.9 seconds, has a range of 244 miles per charge, charges in 3-4 hours, and costs about two cents per mile to operate. DI: Fantastic. And all that will cost us how much? JS:$109,000 base price, fully loaded is about $125K. DI: What kind of extras are we talking about? JS:Premium leather interior, carbon-fiber hard top, and a high-powered connector, which is installed in your home, which allows you to charge in 3-4 hours. DI: How would people charge it otherwise? JS:There's an extension cord that you can plug into any standard 110 outlet. DI: How long does it take to charge with the cord? JS:At half-charge, it will take overnight to recharge. If you're totally empty, it could take a lot longer than that. DI: So how many of these babies have you sold to date? JS:More than 1,300.DI: Let's talk about the motor. Is it as silent as my little hybrid when I cruise to a stop? JS:Well the electric motor is a helluva lot bigger than in a Prius, so you hear a very pleasant turbine-type sound when you're accelerating hard. But when you're accelerating at a slow pace, it's completely silent. DI: Who's the engineer behind it? JS:J.B. Strobel. He's our chief technology officer. He invented the battery pack, which is liquid-cooled, which allows the car to exist as it does. The power-electronics, the battery technology and the motor work in harmony, and that's what gives the car it's high-performance and range. DI: What do you drive? JS:A Tesla. DI: Really? To and from work? JS:Yeah. Either my Tesla or my bicycle.DI: Do you get a lot of people stopping you in supermarket parking lots with questions? JS:Of course. Yeah. DI: You must be sick of that by now. DI: Let's talk about maintenance. What are we talking? JS:Well, there are no oil changes because there's no oil in the car. So it's essentially firmware updates, suspension, brakes, tires, the cooling system that cools the batteries, which is very important and that's about it. All in all it's about a six-hour service. We're opening service centers in New York City, Miami, Chicago, D.C., and Seattle over the next 12 months. It's only a once-a-year maintenance program, but this way they won't have to ship the car back to us here."
739,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/24518/toxic-towns-6-cases-polluted-places,,"Every once in a while, an environmental disaster makes big news, but the effects remain years after the headlines have faded. Here are six stories of what human activity did to mess up Mother Nature. Mossville, Louisiana is a predominantly African-American community on the shores of Lake Charles. It is in Calcasieu Parish, home to 53 industrial facilities, mostly petrochemical plants. These facilities releasenine million pounds of toxic chemicalsinto the environment each year (the manufacturers say2.5 million pounds) Residents havethree times the national average amount of dioxinin their bodies, which the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry does not consider a health risk. Residents say the tests are misleading, as people from all over Calcasieu Parish were tested and Mossville residents should be tested separately. The EPA has Mossville under consideration for Superfund designation. Copper mining in Montana went on for a hundred years before the Anaconda Mining Company began taking ore by the method of mountaintop removal in the 1950s. They shut down operations in 1983, leaving behind a huge hole that became known as the Berkeley Pit, where heavy metals and toxic chemicals collected from the mines. The Superfund site is estimated to contain40 million gallons of polluted runoff. No fish or plants or even insects live there, but in 1995, a microscopicextremophilecalledEuglena mutabiliswas found toflourish in the toxic sludge. Research on the protozoan may lead us to new ways of cleaning up polluted sites.Image by Flickr userSkyTruth. The ground under Picher is honeycombed with lead and zinc mine shafts and tunnels. The area provided metal for bullets and other uses in the first half of the 20th century. The industry lefthuge piles of chat, or leftover rock containing dangerous heavy metals such as lead, zinc, and cadmium all over the community. These metals and other chemicals permeate the air as dust that settles on everything, including the lungs of the residents. Picher is the location of theTar Creek Superfund Site. Disagreements between the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) who originally sold tribal land to mining companies, has stalled cleanup efforts. The mining companies are not contributing to the cleanup, as many of them have gone out of business or declared bankruptcy. Meanwhile, while the population is dwindling, some residents continue to live and raise families in Picher.Image by Flickr userpeggydavis66. In the late 19th century, Love Canal was proposed as a planned community, a""utopian metropolis"". But the developer only got as far as digging a large pit before giving up due to lack of people who actually wanted to live there. In 1920, Niagara Falls bought the pit and used it for a chemical dump. The US army disposed of waste from chemical warfare experiments in Love Canal's pit. Hooker Chemical acquired the property in 1947 and continued chemical disposal. By the 1950s, it was filled with21,000 tons of toxic waste. Hooker Chemical covered it with clay and soil and declared it sealed. They sold it back to the city of Niagara Falls, which built a neighborhood on top. Residents noticed strange smells and odd illnesses, as well as a shockingly high rate ofmiscarriages and birth defects. It wasn't until 1978 that the extent of the area's toxicity was revealed when an investigation by the local newspaper led to federal attention. Tests showed inhabitants of Love Canal had chromosomal damage caused by environmental pollution. Over a thousand families were relocated, and the Superfund program was born out of the incident. Before 1985, a little over 2,000 people lived inTimes Beach, a community just 17 miles from St. Louis. To keep dust down on the dirt roads, the town hiredRussell Blissto spray oil on them. From 1972 to 1976, Bliss treated the roads, using waste oil that he had obtained from Northeastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Company, a company that manufactured Agent Orange. An investigation into Bliss' practices elsewhere led to testing of the soil in Times Beach in 1982. The roads had been paved over by then, but the EPA found dioxin levels in the soil that were 300 times the level considered safe at the time. Other toxins were also found. In 1985, the town was evacuated anddisincorporated. Tons of soil were incinerated over the next few years, and the site is now the home ofRoute 66 State Park. Silverton lies in San Juan County, an area once dotted with gold and silver mines. Water flows from the remains of the mines, carrying heavy metals out and into streams.Localvolunteershave made great strides in cleaning up the polluted streams with artificial wetlands and barricades in some mines, butran into a roadblockin The Clean Water Act. Provisions in the law would make the volunteers, by their acts, responsible for bringing the streams completely up to federal standards. The alternative is to do nothing and let water running from the mines return to their previous pollution levels. The passage of aGood Samaritan billthat would protect those who did not cause the initial pollution from liability while cleaning it up would put the volunteers back in business.Image by Wikimedia contributorTewy. This list barely scratches the surface of the many toxic towns in the US. Then there are those sites in which the damage and/or danger has yet to be discovered.

740,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/20280/messing-mother-nature-5-cautionary-tales,,"The balance of nature took about four billion years to settle into the pattern the earth now holds. When humans change one thing, large or small, it begins a chain reaction that we often can't foresee. We don't know everything there is to know about Mother Nature yet. In 1956, Brazilian geneticistWarwick Kerrimported a robust but aggressive African strain of honeybee namedApis mellifera adansoniito breed with the European species that were used for honey production. Before the planned mating the next year, 26 swarms of the African bees escaped from the apiary in Sao Paulo. They bred with wild bees and their descendants became known as Africanized bees, or ""killer bees"". They have a tendency to attack any animal that wanders into their territory, sting their enemies in large groups, and remain agitated for up to 24 hours after the slightest provocation. They spread over South America into North America, and were found in the United States in1990. Colonies have been reported in all the southernmost states fromCalifornia to Florida. Fourteen people have beenkilledby the Africanized bees, but the biggest impact is the genetic invasion of the commercial beekeeping industry, which has always bred bees to be as docile as possible. The primitive weedLyngbya majusculais called fireweed by ocean fishermen inMoreton Bay, Australiawho suffer blisters and rashes from contact or just by breathing around the weed. Divers describe the weed as""brown fuzz"". In summer, Lyngbya majuscula covers a 30 square mile area of Moreton Bay and produces about 100 kinds of toxin. Lyngbya majusculathrives on oxygen-depleted water, leading scientists to believe that industrial and sewage runoff has allowed the plant to proliferate, especially as other plant and animal species die out. It grows as fast a 100 square meters a minute! Once established, Lyngbya creates its own nitrogen fertilizer from decaying parts of the plant. Many fishermen in Moreton Bay avoid working in the four months every year that Lyngbya clogs their waters. Kudzu(Pueraria lobata)covers overseven million acresof the American Deep South. At the 1876 Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Japanese government made an impression by building a beautiful garden featuring their native plants, including kudzu. Americans wanted the charming vines for their own gardens. In the 1920s, the Glen Arden Nursery in Chipley, Florida promoted the plant as animal food. The US government promoted the plant for erosion control in the 30s and 40s, and paid Civilian Conservation Corps workers and farmers to plant it all over. The vine grows up to a foot a day, with reports of two or three feet a day. Kudzu covered buildings, crops, and forests. Native plants died from lack of light. Herbicides were ineffective. The government promotion of kudzu stopped in 1953, and it was declared a weed in 1972. Kudzu has quite a few uses forfood, medicine, and household products, but is considered a nuisance. Image byClintJCL. Officials at the Wilhelmina Zoo in Stuttgart selected a strain of seaweed to use asan aquarium plant. Their choice was the hardy and attractiveCaulerpa taxifolia. They selectively bred an even more robust strain they namedCaulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) C. Agandh, which they shared with other aquariums. A sample escaped into the wild, possibly by a drain at Monaco's Oceanographic Museum. In 1984, a patch of the seaweed was found in the Mediterranean Sea. In 2000, it was detected in waters off the US and Australia. It spread into thousands of acres of sea by 2001. Caulerpa was spread by boats and fishing nets, and by aquarium owners cleaning their tanks. It was bred to taste bad, so native animals won't eat it. As little asone square centimeterof Caulerpa can regenerate and start a new colony. The state of California battled the weed by covering and poisoning patches, a very expensive but rather successful method. European countries with more to battle remove it mechanically, which may control but will not eradicate Caulerpa. The man made strainCaulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) C. Agandhis now an illegal species in many countries. The World Conservation Union named it one of the100 World's Worst Invasive Alien Species. A case in Borneo illustrates the delicate balance of nature and the unintended consequences of human intervention. An early 50s outbreak of malaria led the World Health Organization (WHO) to bring inmassive amounts of DDTto kill mosquitoes. They killed the mosquitoes, but also virtually wiped out a particular species of parasitic wasp. The wasp fed on thatch-eating caterpillars. With the wasps gone, the caterpillars ate the villager's roofs! An even worse consequence was that geckos ate the poisoned insects and were in turn eaten by native cats. The native cats died from DDT poisoning, and therefore the rat population flourished. This lead to an outbreak oftyphus and plagueamong humans. To assuage the damage, WHO arranged for a supply drop that included a couple dozen healthy cats! This supply drop (which included other supplies) was dubbedOperation Cat Drop. The cats were able to reduce the rodent population to controllable levels, and DDT was eventually outlawed. As we continue to ""improve"" the environment and serve a growing human population, there will be more such stories to come."
741,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/20086/anasazi-mystery,,"700 years ago, in the area that we today know as Arizona and New Mexico, the Anasazi people came en masse from the north to build large stone settlements.  Their predecessors (the Hohokam) had built with sticks and mud, and as a result the older settlements are much harder to find today.  The Anasazi settlements stand as grand, abandoned cities that now house a mystery:  why did these people move south?  What would cause a thriving civilization to pull up stakes and abandon its homeland? ANew York Timesarticle surveys the current archaeological thinking: What makes the puzzle weirder is that the Anasazi never went back to their northern homeland.  Even if climate change (for example, a drought in the thirteenth century) caused the initial migration, why didn't the Anasazi people return to their northern cities after the rains returned, just a few decades later?

742,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/17146/how-climate-change-messing-sports,,"We've all heard about the dangers of global warming and climate change. It's going to make the oceans rise, drown our cities, kill plants, cause hurricanes and ruin the Earth for our grandkids. But that's all secondary to the real effects of global warming; it's wreaking havoc on the sports world. Here's a look at seven ways climate change is messing up sports. Organizers were worried going into last weekend's Chicago Marathon. The temperatures were expected totop anythingseen in the marathon's 30-year history, which meant some runners could overheat or become dehydrated. Either way, they knew times would be down. So they responded with new cooling stations, record amounts of water, 700 medical workers on standby and mist adapters for fire hydrants along the route. Even with all that planning, they weren't nearly ready for what happened.One man diedfrom a heart condition and312 other runnerswere treated at hospitals or medical stations. The city ran out of ambulances to treat runners and cut the race short, diverting runners to Grant Park, where they later complained of a lack of water. All told, the record-setting marathon (in temperatures only, not speed) was a mess and could cost Chicago the2016 Olympics. Not surprisingly, it's the winter sports that are getting hit hardest by the Earth's rising temperatures. Skiing officials around the world are trying to deal with retreating glaciers in the Alps andmelting snowelsewhere in the world.  Some estimates say that Aspen won't be able to support skiing as early as 2050. TheLake Champlain Ice Fishing Championshiphas been scrapped in recent years because the lake hasn't frozen over.Biathlon trialshave been canceled.Even the Iditarod, that intrepid Alaskan race, has succumbed to heat. Every year since 2003, the race hasn't been able to start in the traditional starting point in Anchorage because of melting snow and slush.  In the race's 30 years before 2003, the starting point had never been moved, but now the ""Idita-detour,"" as one race official called it, has become a bit of a tradition itself. The Miami Dolphins used to be really good, back in the days of the perfect season and Dan Marino. But lately, things haven't been as hot for the Dolphins. That's partly because of, well, how hot it's gotten. The scorching heat during training camp and the early season was endangering players during practices, so the team decided to build an air-conditioned ""practice bubble."" The bubble, which is oddly both inflatable and hurricane-safe, allowed the team to practice away from the sun and mimic the conditions of a domed stadium. However, it didn't allow the players to mimic the conditions of playing outside in the baking Florida sun. The Dolphins used to have a big edge in early season home games because they were so accustomed to working through the humidity, but since the bubble was builtthey've gone 5-8in such games. The first time Detroit hosted the Super Bowl in 1982, ice storms hit the city and the wind chill effect made it feel like it was 27 below outside. That led the NFL to avoid cold-weather sites; with the exception of Minneapolis in 1992, the Super Bowl didn't go north again until 2006, when it returned to Detroit. Rather than fighting the supposedly inevitable winter storm that would hit the city, organizers decided to embrace it and turn Detroit into a winter wonderland. Instead,global warmingthrew the city for a loop with highs in the 40's and rain, not snow. A 28-foot-tall snow slide melted and the Motown Winter Blast had to cope with conditions that even made the fake snow melt. All of the intense planning that went into snow removal almost went to waste. It did snow on Super Bowl Sunday, but nowhere near what organizers were expecting, forcing them to scrap most of the snow-themed festivities around the city."
743,Mental Floss,environment,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/17372/obesity-global-trade-and-beer-prices-why-farm-bill-actually-cool,,"As is usually the case with bills in Congress, I had a lot of trouble believing that the2007 Farm Billwas applicable to me. After all, the last time I even remember going to a farm was on a kindergarten field trip, when I got goat's milk squirted directly into my mouth and I almost threw up. So, when a friend told me the Farm Bill was really important for everyone, I laughed at him. That is, until he told me beer prices might go up. I did some poking around and, lo and behold, found out that the Farm Bill was actually far more interesting and important than it sounds. The Farm Bill is the label given to an enormous bundle of programs related to food that comes up for review about every five years. Right now the Senate and House are debating two versions, which will be combined and sent to the President, who is threatening a veto. It controls nearly anything related to food, everything from crop subsidies to food stamps. It looks boring on the surface (unless you're really into distributing funds and studying crops), but once you get past that, it has effects on almost every part of life, from energy prices to foreign trade. First off, the bill, not surprisingly, has an impact on the diet of the nation. But it is surprising that the impact is negative. That's right, the Farm Bill ismaking us fat. It subsidizes corn, soybeans and wheat, three crops that contribute to much of the carbs and fats from processed foods. That means farmers are more likely to grow these crops, making them cheaper to manufacturers and thus making fatty foods more plentiful and cheaper. Meanwhile, there's little support for growing produce, which is why those fresh veggies are more expensive than the Hostess cakes. However, this year's bill has given more focus to fruits and veggies, including a boost in funding for produce snacks for schools, so carrot sticks are back on the rise. One of the more notable results of a farm bill is thefood stamp program, which helps the poor buy food. In the version that passed the House, this year's Farm Bill increases funding to the program and expanding the number of people eligible. It's also helping out food banks, by giving them more support and more nutritious options. Believe it or not, the $4 billion boost for food stamps was one of themost contentious partsof the bill. Even outside of food, the bill has far-reaching consequences. Much of the food produced domestically is exported or traded, so American agriculture affects much of the world's economy. Thus, the Farm Bill can do a lot to other countries, which is whythe WTOhas gotten involved in the discussions. But all that energy talk may have much bigger consequences than just the environment. As farmers move to grow corn, what with the high demand and subsidies, they've moved away from other crops. Among others, there's been adecrease in barley and hops production, which means beer could be going up in price. And college students across the nation cry."
